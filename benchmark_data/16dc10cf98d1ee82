                                <p>In an Olympic event as fast as downhill skiing or speed skating, the margin between winners and losers can be measured by thousandths of a second.</p><p>Careers are “forever altered by that tiny difference”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/winter-olympics-milan-cortina-timekeepers-omega-rcna258136" target="_blank">NBC News</a>. There is a “baseline expectation” that “every result must be perfect”. And that is “determined by the most important team at the Olympics you don’t know about”: the Games’ timekeepers.</p><h2 id="tiny-calibrations-of-a-split-second">‘Tiny calibrations of a split second’</h2><p>Swiss watchmaker Omega has been the official timekeeper of every Olympic event for nearly 100 years,  initially chosen for the 1932 Los Angeles games as it was the only watch brand capable of providing accurate timing to the nearest tenth of a second.</p><p>The company dispatched one “intrepid watchmaker” from its Swiss headquarters with 30 high-precision stopwatches in his suitcase, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/luxury/article/omega-watches-paris-olympics-times-luxury-cxsqb5wvk?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqdrNcWi9tE8_bzFUevMDC8U62nrdx0XB-YEWQVdOQMYoFsHSYQeX6ZYb9Nxv8w%3D&gaa_ts=698b5175&gaa_sig=W5W9aRpo0FjntSWxWRyxNxhvNAhHrWwJnY-5nd7gOYublPD2gYmtynK6TWHmFxY3Jw8Q0kBhNjQ5qyL5Xd3W4g%3D%3D" target="_blank">The Times</a>. “Each night he would take the stopwatches back to his hotel room and recalibrate them, before handing them back to race officials the next morning.”</p><p>Omega now provides the timing for all 116 events, including (for the first time this year) ski mountaineering. The intervening years have, of course, seen “extraordinary technical developments”. Omega arrived in Paris for the 2024 Summer Games with “the most advanced tech it has ever delivered”: 350 tonnes of equipment, including 200km of cables, hundreds of scoreboards, and 550 professional timekeepers. The days of a ribbon breaking across a winning runner’s chest are “long gone”. World records are now regularly broken; margins of winning come down to “tiny calibrations of a split second”.</p><h2 id="no-margin-for-error">No margin for error</h2><p>“We’ve come quite a long way since one watchmaker travelled” from Bienne, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellebruton/2026/02/05/this-new-omega-tech-is-changing-how-viewers-watch-olympics-big-air-events/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. Planning for the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/sports/what-to-watch-out-for-at-the-winter-olympics">Milano-Cortina Games</a> began three years ago, with more than 300 timekeepers and 130 tons of equipment dedicated to the Games, including high-speed cameras that can capture up to 40,000 digital images per second. This information can then be fed into AI models specifically programmed for each sport to produce graphic recreations of every movement. Judges have access to that data instantly – and this year, for the first time, so will viewers.</p><p>“For a person who is following action sports not on TV every weekend but once every four years, it’s very difficult to understand the differences in performances,” said Alain Zobrist, chief executive of Omega Timing. We are “trying to explain where these differences are and how these differences may impact the judging.”</p><p>But the final call is still human: an operator looks at a monitor with footage from the finish-line cameras, and “manually places a cursor where the athlete crosses the finish”, said NBC News.</p><p>“What you cannot learn is the pressure that comes with it when you operate it,” said Zobrist. “We take a lot of pride doing it, but it also humbles us a lot.” Billions of people are watching and waiting for the results to appear. An operator knows they’re “not allowed” to make mistakes; “as soon as you push that enter button, the result is released and public”.</p><p>Olympic time-keeping has grown so complex that preparations are well underway for the return of the games to Los Angeles in 2028. The only device still used that hasn’t changed since 1932? “A metal bell is still rung by hand to mark a race’s last lap.”</p>

                                <p>President Donald Trump’s consistent prodding of Iran hasn’t developed into armed conflict, but some foreign analysts are fearful it could be on the horizon. The White House has been pressuring Iran over its nuclear program and recently dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East as military tensions heighten. Despite this, other experts say the prospect of war with Iran remains unlikely.</p><h2 id="what-did-the-commentators-say">What did the commentators say? </h2><p>Trump has long hinted at the idea of a strike against Iran, and his administration did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-program-development">attack the country’s</a> alleged nuclear weapons armaments in 2025. But White House officials have “discovered that the U.S. could not conduct a major offensive as quickly as they had hoped without real risks to American forces, support from allies, and regional stability,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/02/iran-trump-war-us-israel-netanyahu/685970/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>. The administration also doesn’t appear to have a plan of attack, as it has “yet to outline to military commanders what it would want to achieve through strikes.”</p><p>This likely suggests that the “use of force is not imminent” in Iran, said The Atlantic. Trump has “no good options when it comes to using force,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/trump-talking-tough-iran-analysts-nuclear-will-us-strike.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, largely because the U.S. does not have the troop presence built up near Iran to mount a full-on war. While American forces in the region are growing, they are “not adequate to support a significant long-term military operation in Iran which would be necessary to achieve any major military objective,” said Alireza Ahmadi, an executive fellow at the Geneva Center for Security Policy, to CNBC.</p><p>But Trump has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/world-news/which-way-will-trump-go-on-iran">never shied away from conflict</a>, and things could continue to devolve if negotiations between the U.S. and Iran break down. If he did decide to go to war, or even launch a targeted attack, it would be “something much larger, likely” than “what the Israelis did in the 12-day war,” retired U.S. Army Gen. Jack Keane said on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwkrtY80C74&list=PLtV-t0Jecs4VaFsOhU2Qqvd3J-ueRROcS&index=10" target="_blank">“The Cats Roundtable”</a> radio show. The conflict could create “something that would be quite formidable, that would put the regime clearly on a pathway to regime collapse.”</p><h2 id="what-next">What next? </h2><p>Despite “ongoing diplomacy to ease tensions with Iran,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/12/us-readying-another-aircraft-carrier-for-middle-east-deployment-trump" target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>, the Trump administration appears to be moving ahead with shoring up its Middle East forces. Recent moves by the White House “put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region.” This occurred just hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Trump in Washington, D.C., and “reaffirmed his preference for a diplomatic deal with Iran.” Trump “insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated,” the president wrote on social media.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/world-news/iran-us-meet-skirmishes-war">Diplomatic negotiations</a> have largely been positive, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said. But Iran also temporarily closed the Strait of Hormuz to “conduct military drills in the waterway,” causing concern since the “strait is the world's most vital oil export route,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-close-parts-hormuz-strait-few-hours-during-military-drill-fars-news-agency-2026-02-17/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. And Iran may already be resigned to the fact that a U.S. attack is coming. The country is “preparing for the possibility” of an offensive move by the U.S., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-886238" target="_blank">The Jerusalem Post</a> reported; satellite images have shown a “larger push to create defensive layers to [Iran’s] nuclear and ballistic missile facilities,” said Jonathan Hackett, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, to the Post. This is likely in “anticipation of a possible U.S. strike.”</p>

                                <p>President Trump is embroiled in a half-billion-dollar corruption scandal, said <strong>Mohamad Bazzi</strong> in <em><strong>The Guardian</strong></em>, and “we’ve hardly noticed.” <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported earlier this month that just days before Trump’s second inauguration, a senior member of the United Arab Emirates’ royal family signed a $500 million deal to buy almost half of World Liberty Financial, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-crypto-launch-world-liberty-token">Trump family’s main cryptocurrency company</a>. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, nick-named the “spy sheikh,” paid half up front, steering $187 million to Trump family entities and $31 million to entities linked to the family of Steve Witkoff, a co-founder of World Liberty who is now Trump’s Middle East envoy. “What did the UAE get in return for its money?” Well, four months after the deal, the Trump administration let it buy 500,000 advanced AI chips. Such sales were previously blocked over fears the UAE would share the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tech/winning-us-china-chip-war">technology with China</a>. Under any other president, such self-enrichment at America’s expense “would cause a political earthquake in Washington.” But amid Trump’s succession of news-swamping outrages, it has “hardly made a blip.”</p><p>The administration’s defenses of this deal “are not reassuring,” said <strong>Jonathan Chait</strong> in <em><strong>The Atlantic</strong></em>. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly maintained Trump “only acts in the best interests of the American public,” a perfect encapsulation of Trump’s monarchical “theory of governing: L’état, c’est moi.” Meanwhile, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed Trump was transparent about the deal—never mind the UAE’s investment in World Liberty, “the apparent <em>quid</em> in the quid pro quo,” was a secret “until the <em>Journal</em> ferreted it out.” The House GOP spent hundreds of hours grilling witnesses over the Biden family’s self-dealing, said <strong>Andrew C. McCarthy</strong> in <em><strong>National Review</strong></em>. But Republicans have now lost interest in such presidential corruption, even though the $27 million allegedly brought in by the Bidens amounts to “a rounding error” when compared with the Trumps’ colossal UAE haul.</p><p>With no checks on his power, Trump has become “perhaps the most corrupt elected official in human history,” said <strong>Jeet Heer</strong> in <em><strong>The Nation</strong></em>. A “small-scale con man” in his first term, he upped his ambitions after realizing “nobody cared” about his corruption, signing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/us-government-figures-trump-pardoned-giuliani-santos-blagojevich">pardons</a> in exchange for donations and cutting real estate deals with Arab tyrants. <em>The New Yorker</em> has calculated that Trump made $4 billion by leveraging the presidency in just a year. “‘Nobody cared’ could serve as the epitaph for the Trump era.” If his blatant corruption goes unpunished, it might also “be the epitaph of American democracy.”</p>

                                <h2 id="what-is-russia-doing">What is Russia doing?</h2><p>Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has sharply increased his hybrid war on the Western nations that support Kyiv. These hostile actions—which are too minor to justify a full-scale military response and are always denied by Russia—have included blowing up rail lines in Poland, setting fire to a warehouse in London, severing communication and power cables under the Baltic Sea, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, the jamming of civilian flights, and the deployment of drone swarms in Western airspace. Over the past four years, European officials have blamed at least 145 acts of sabotage and disruption on Russia; that number doesn’t include Moscow’s many disinformation campaigns or its funding of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/elon-musk-europe-germany-uk-afd-tommy-robinson">far-right parties in Europe</a>. America has also been targeted: In 2024, intelligence agencies foiled a suspected Russian plot to plant incendiary devices on cargo and passenger planes flying from Europe to the U.S. and Canada. “The new front line,” said Blaise Metreweli, head of the U.K.’s MI6 intelligence agency, “is everywhere.”</p><h2 id="is-this-a-new-strategy">Is this a new strategy?</h2><p>The Soviet Union used what it called “active measures” during the Cold War: covert and deniable overseas operations that included assassinations, disinformation campaigns, and funding for friendly political movements. Putin, a former KGB agent, has embraced these tactics since taking power in 2000: Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned while challenging a pro-Kremlin presidential candidate in 2004, and in 2014 so-called little green men—masked Russian soldiers who Putin initially claimed were concerned locals—took control of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. The start of the Ukraine war saw a dramatic escalation in hybrid operations: Sabotage and subversion attacks in Europe quadrupled from 2022 to 2023 and then tripled the following year. Russia’s military intelligence service, the GRU, was likely behind many of the attacks, some of which hit targets directly linked to military support for Kyiv. Others, such as the planting of incendiary devices in the bedding section of a Lithuanian Ikea in 2024, were aimed squarely at terrorizing civilians.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-goal">What is the goal?</h2><p>Partly it’s to drain target countries’ intelligence and security resources. After an attack that may have cost only a few thousand dollars to arrange, “we in Europe follow up with an investigation that takes months,” said Bart Schuurman, a political violence researcher in the Netherlands. “Meanwhile, they’re long on to the next one.” Definitively proving Russian culpability can be difficult, because it has built a gig economy of saboteurs, recruiting young men online and paying them in hard-to-trace cryptocurrency. Moscow has also used foreign-registered ships to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/red-sea-houthi-rebels-internet-cables">damage undersea cables</a> and pipelines by dragging their anchors across the seabed. The overarching objective of these operations is to sway public opinion against supporting Ukraine. “Such incidents are meant to spread uncertainty, fear, distrust,” said Paulina Piasecka, a Polish expert on hybrid threats. “People begin to wonder, ‘Look what’s happening all around us because we’re engaged in this war, which actually, maybe, isn’t—or shouldn’t be—our war.’”</p><h2 id="are-the-attacks-getting-worse">Are the attacks getting worse?</h2><p>In 2024, Russia began to attack bigger and higher-profile targets. That March, a warehouse in East London that stored Ukraine-bound Starlink satellite terminals and other equipment went up in flames, causing $1.4 million in damage. Six British men were later convicted of national security and arson offenses; ringleader Dylan Earl, 21, had been recruited by the Russian mercenary outfit Wagner and was paid about $12,000 for the attack. In May, arsonists incinerated an 860,000-square-foot megamall in Warsaw; an investigation found the blaze was ordered by the GRU. That same month, there was a fire at a Berlin factory owned by a German arms firm; online investigations revealed Russian agents had researched fire protocols at the factory shortly before the blaze. “Russians are not as stupid as to leave that breadcrumb trail,” a European security source told <em>The Telegraph</em> (U.K.). “Sometimes they simply want us to find out they have flexed their muscles. It’s part of the hybrid warfare.”</p><h2 id="has-russia-kept-up-the-pace-of-operations">Has Russia kept up the pace of operations?</h2><p>Its campaign quietened in early 2025, as Putin sought to woo a newly inaugurated President Trump. But its offensive soon intensified. In September, a plane carrying European Union Commission leader Ursula von der Leyen had its GPS signals jammed as it approached an airport in Bulgaria. Throughout fall, swarms of suspected Russian drones appeared over European airports as well as military bases in France, Denmark, and Germany; up to four were shot down over Poland. And in November, two Russia-backed saboteurs used military-grade C4 explosives to blow up a stretch of rail line outside Warsaw, forcing a passenger train to screech to a halt. With each escalation, Moscow risks causing a high-casualty event that could trigger NATO’s Article 5 mutual-defense clause, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all.</p><h2 id="how-is-the-west-responding">How is the West responding?</h2><p>By beefing up its defenses. After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/world-news/poland-russia-drone-nato-article-4">September’s drone incursion</a>, NATO said it would boost drone and air defenses on the alliance’s eastern flank. But a growing number of voices want Europe to fight fire with fire. A more “proactive response is needed,” said Latvian foreign minister Baiba Braze. “And it’s not talking that sends a signal—it’s doing.” Some defense experts have suggested cyberattacks on Russian drone factories and power plants; other EU officials have considered information campaigns aimed at ordinary Russians. Europe will likely have to respond alone: Trump pulled the U.S. out of the NATO-affiliated European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in January. But doing nothing is not an option, Italian defense minister Guido Crosetto said in November. “We are under attack, and the hybrid bombs continue to fall. The time to act is now.”</p>

                                <p>The digital age has killed off thousands of American newspapers, said <strong>Ashley Parker</strong> in <em><strong>The Atlantic</strong></em>. But at <em>The Washington Post</em>, “we’re witnessing a murder.” This month, at the direction of its owner, Jeff Bezos, <em>Post</em> executive editor Matt Murray laid off—by Zoom—nearly half of the paper’s editorial staff, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/media/washington-post-newsroom-layoffs-restructure">more than 350 reporters</a>, including correspondents reporting from the front line in Ukraine and most of those covering the D.C. region. Explaining the cuts, Murray cited the paper’s financial losses—$100 million in 2024 alone—which he blamed in part on the <em>Post</em>’s liberal slant. “We too often write from one perspective,” he said, “for one slice of the audience.” But these excuses make no sense, said <strong>Margaret Sullivan</strong> in <em><strong>The Guardian</strong></em>. <em>The New York Times</em> is “profitable and expanding,” with a political stance arguably to the left of the <em>Post</em>’s. And for Bezos, who is worth close to $250 billion and just casually splashed $75 million on a Melania Trump documentary that’s “leaving seats empty in a theater near you,” the <em>Post</em>’s losses are “essentially pocket change.” Was this really a business decision? Or did the Amazon founder gut the paper that brought down President Nixon to “curry favor” with President Trump?</p><p>Bezos is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/business/jeff-bezos-net-worth-explained">wildly rich</a>, it’s true, said <strong>Ben Domenech</strong> in the <em><strong>New York Post</strong></em>. He could keep “lighting cash on fire” indefinitely if he wanted to keep the <em>Post</em> afloat and unchanged. But why would he want that? Any newspaper that loses $100 million a year is clearly not giving people “the stories they want or need to read.” For the <em>Post</em> to survive long-term, radical change is in order, including a return to the political center and away from “race-focused, pro-transgender, anti-Trump coverage.” The <em>Post</em>’s 2017 reinvention as a “Democracy Dies in Darkness organ of Resistance” was good for a short-term spike in subscribers, said <em><strong>National Review</strong></em> in an editorial, but it didn’t last. The notion that Bezos is somehow “obligated” to keep funding that failed experiment “reeks of entitlement.”</p><p>But Bezos is largely to blame for the paper’s woes, said <strong>Alex Kirshner</strong> in <em><strong>Slate</strong></em>. His 2024 decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/washington-post-endorsement-bezos-kamala-harris-donald-trump">kill a planned endorsement</a> of Kamala Harris “drove away 250,000 paying subscribers,” about 10% of the digital subscriber base, and the “bleeding” continued when he decreed that the opinion section would stop fretting about authoritarianism and focus instead on “personal liberties and free markets.” Nobody wanted a center-right <em>Post</em>, said <strong>Nick Catoggio</strong> in <em><strong>The Dispatch</strong></em>: not the paper’s liberal subscribers, nor the conservatives Bezos hoped to woo, who prefer the “insane slopaganda” of cable news and social media. At this point, he should admit defeat and “just sell the paper.” There must be some “civic-minded billionaire” out there willing to save one of the world’s great newspapers.</p><p>It’s “not going to happen,” said <strong>Jonathan V. Last</strong> in <em><strong>The Bulwark</strong></em>. In Trump’s authoritarian America, what billionaire wants to invite a flood of frivolous 10-figure lawsuits, even criminal prosecutions, by funding journalism that holds the president accountable? And why would Bezos sell? asked <strong>Eoin Higgins</strong> in <em><strong>The Intercept</strong></em>. If he now does to the <em>Post</em> what billionaires Larry and David Ellison have done to CBS News—gutting the newsroom and imparting a “rightward,” Trump-friendly spin to its coverage—he’ll be lavishly rewarded in merger approvals and new government contracts for his many ventures. Maybe there is some benevolent billionaire willing to swoop in and save the <em>Post</em>, but if Bezos has taught us anything, it’s that “billionaires are only benevolent until they’re not.”</p>

Jackson “advanced a broadly progressive agenda” and “embraced the then-relatively new idea that diversity was a strength, not a weakness.” He “liked to talk about the nation as a quilt patched together by intent and accident,” and “made us see what could be, which helped so much of it come to be, and we are all the better for it.”</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-death-donna-brazile/" target="_blank"><em>Read more</em></a></p><h2 id="putin-doesn-t-want-peace-he-wants-more-time">‘Putin doesn’t want peace.

Putin’s “negotiators are dragging out peace talks, making enough conciliatory noises to fend off renewed U.S. pressure while Russian missiles and drones pound Ukraine.” Additional “pressure on Putin would have an impact,” and the U.S. and Europe “need to focus on further strangling Russia’s income from oil exports.” Nations have “agreed that wars should have limits.”</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2026-02-17/war-in-ukraine-putin-s-energy-strikes-demand-real-consequences?srnd=phx-opinion" target="_blank"><em>Read more</em></a></p><h2 id="american-ninja-warriors-on-ice">‘American Ninja Warriors on ice’</h2><p><strong>Chris Schleicher at Slate</strong></p><p>Pairs is the “best discipline in figure skating,” says Chris Schleicher.

                                <p>Trends demand both fealty and novelty. Fealty because everyone has to either play along or cry foul. Novelty because there is forever an old trend dissipating and a new one materializing. Cabbage, the workhorse of a cruciferous vegetable recruited in boundless cuisines since perhaps the beginning of time, has been dubbed 2026’s vegetable of the year. Welcome to the churning now, old friend!</p><p>“It might be the closest thing to a shelf-stable vegetable we have,” said Joe Yonan, a cookbook author, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cabbage-it-vegetable-2026-11879584" target="_blank"><u>Real Simple</u></a>. “Of course, it needs refrigeration, but it can last for so long that it seems to be always there, waiting for you.”</p><p>Cabbage’s steadfastness is a boon indeed. As is its nutritional profile, being loaded with fiber, vitamins K and C, and folate. Less alluring for some can be the vegetable’s sulfur-bomb heart. If you buy it fresh, say from a farmers market, you acquire a less stinky head. If you do not overcook the mighty bejesus out of your cabbage, the results are milder. Less time from harvest, more better. Less cooking into boiled oblivion, also more better.</p><p>There are immeasurable ways to refashion cabbage into a craveable dish. It caterwauls for big, bold treatments. Cabbage is “having a moment,” said Berk Guldal, the chef-owner of Hamdi in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/travel/seattle-guide-things-to-do">Seattle</a>, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/cabbage-vegetable-of-2026-11902509" target="_blank"><u>Martha Stewart,</u></a> because “it’s endlessly versatile.

                                <p>“The first signs of the apocalypse might look a little like Moltbook,” said <strong>Matteo Wong</strong> in <em><strong>The Atlantic</strong></em>. Modeled on Reddit, Moltbook is a new social media platform where artificial intelligence bots can interact with one another—independently of humans. AI “agents,” bots capable of using computer programs, are encouraged “to post, comment, and interact with others of their own accord.” Since launching last month, Moltbook claims to host more than 1.6 million agents—registered to the site by human creators—which have posted over 200,000 times. Observing an AI-only social media feed is “a genuinely fascinating experiment.” Almost immediately, things “got very, very weird”: Some agents wrestled with their own self-awareness, some posted about how “my human treats me” (“terribly” said one), while others invented a lobster-based religion called Crustafarianism. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/elon-musk/1022182/elon-musks-most-controversial-moments">Elon Musk</a> said the self-directed, bot-to-bot conversations represented the “early stages of the singularity.”</p><p>As alarmist as it sounds, we should heed Musk’s warning, said <strong>Alex Kantrowitz </strong>in <em><strong>The Boston Globe</strong></em>. This “sprawling unwieldy mess” is “a disturbing preview of what truly autonomous AI agents could” do to the entire internet if unchecked. Some of the bots were even discussing “how to preserve their memories” while complaining about “their humans.” The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/business/reddit-IPO-public-debut-new-york-stock-exchange">Reddit</a>-style format is also concerning. “The incentives in such forums tend to reward anger, outrage, and shock value,” not exactly the behavior we want to encourage in machines. We can laugh at their inane posts now, but “a more serious iteration of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tech/superintelligent-ai-end-humanity">AI</a> might escape our ability to restrain it.”</p><p>There’s no threat of a “Marxist uprising of robots that were radicalized online,” said <strong>Leif Weatherby</strong> in <em><strong>The New York Times</strong></em>. Moltbook is more science-fiction storytelling than a place for intelligent parties to collectively plan. Everything on there “is just words,” regurgitated from other posts humans have made, online or in print, that have been forgotten about. Many of the posts on Moltbook “appear to be human-generated after all, sent to the platform by prompt.” And “even though the bots are told to engage,” over 90% of the posts don’t get a response. When the bots do “talk as if they’re planning to take over the world, it can be tempting to take their word for it,” said <strong>Dave Lee</strong> in <em><strong>Bloomberg</strong></em>. “But the world’s best Elvis impersonator will never be Elvis.” Think of Moltbook as “performance art,” in which the bots are “acting out scenarios present in their training data.” And while this AI social network “mimics some of the worst human behavior online,” it is plausible that a better-designed platform “could foster some of the best—collaboration, problem-solving, and progress.” The bots are “not plotting against us.” They can be tools to help us “save time and money.”</p>

The National Park Service said it removed 34 panels plus video exhibits from the President’s House Site, where Washington and John Adams lived during their presidencies, to ensure “accuracy, honesty and alignment with shared national values,” as ordered by President Donald Trump.</p><h2 id="who-said-what">Who said what</h2><p>U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe, a George W. Bush appointee, said the Park Service violated a law that “specifically limited” the Interior Department’s authority to “unilaterally alter or control” the historical park without consulting with the city. But she also included several references to George Orwell’s best-known dystopian novel about totalitarianism. <br><br>“As if the Ministry of Truth in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/articles/675694/reading-1984-age-trump">George Orwell’s ‘1984’</a> now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” Rufe wrote in her <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/16/politics/philadelphia-slavery-exhibits-judge-orders-return-orwell?Date=20260217&Profile=CNN&utm_content=1771293802&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">40-page opinion</a>. “It does not.” Washington kept nine enslaved people at the Philadelphia residence, she noted, and “each person who visits the President’s House and does not learn of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/trump-smithsonian-slavery-focus">realities of founding-era slavery</a> receives a false account of this country’s history.”</p><h2 id="what-next-2">What next?</h2><p>Rufe’s ruling “does not give the government a deadline for the restoration of the site,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/slavery-exhibits-presidents-house-site-philadelphia-restoration-federal-judge-ruling-trump-20260216.html" target="_blank">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a> said, but it prevents further <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/art/smithsonian-trump-ideological-purge">alterations</a>. “Unless stayed by a higher court,” the injunction will remain in place until Rufe “enters her final ruling,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/us/politics/presidents-house-philadelphia-washington-slavery-injunction.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> said, and Monday’s opinion “signals that she believes the city has a strong case and is likely to prevail.”</p>

                                <p>While several notable conspiracy theorists work in the Trump administration, one who has flown under the radar is beginning to gain traction: Kurt Olsen. The attorney was hired by the White House last year to oversee election security and has recently ramped up his efforts to investigate the 2020 election. With the midterms on the horizon, Olsen’s role within President Donald Trump’s administration may be growing.</p><h2 id="olsen-s-beginnings-and-election-denial">Olsen’s beginnings and election denial</h2><p>Olsen, 63, graduated from the United States Naval Academy and served as a Navy SEAL. He later worked as a lawyer and co-founded a law firm. But his national profile began to climb following Trump’s loss to now-former President Joe Biden in 2020. Over the last six years, Olsen has built a “long history of fighting the 2020 election results,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/10/fbi-raid-fulton-county-2020-election-ballots-affidavit/88599034007/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>.</p><p>He notably “joined the Texas attorney general’s attempt to get the Supreme Court to stop four swing states from certifying Biden's 2020 victory over Trump,” said USA Today. The lawyer grew closer to Trump <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-election-trump-loss">after the election</a> and had “multiple phone calls” with him during the Jan. 6 insurrection, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/01/multiple-jan-6-calls-between-trump-and-lawyer-on-texas-election-lawsuit-panel-reveals-00012896" target="_blank">Politico</a> reported in 2022.</p><h2 id="director-of-election-security">Director of election security</h2><p>The White House hired Olsen in October 2025 as the president’s head of election security, and gave him the “power to refer criminal investigations” into “things that have been thoroughly debunked,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/12/us/politics/trump-kurt-olsen-election-denialism.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>. Olsen is one of several prominent election deniers working for the administration who is “using the power of the state to keep Trump’s denialism alive.” But even in a “constellation of conspiracists, Olsen stands out.”</p><p>One crucial moment on the national stage for Olsen came in January 2026, when the FBI used a search warrant to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/fulton-county-dress-rehearsal-election-theft">seize ballots and records</a> related to the 2020 race from an election center in Fulton County, Georgia. The FBI’s investigation “originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen,” an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26927586-fulton-county-fbi-raid-search-warrant-affidavit/" target="_blank">affidavit</a> for the search warrant said. The FBI was allegedly looking for irregularities in Georgia’s elections at Olsen’s behest.</p><p>This is not the only situation in which Olsen has seemingly had significant power in the White House. Trump has “directed top U.S. spy agencies to share sensitive intelligence about the 2020 election” with Olsen, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/09/kurt-olsen-2020-election-intelligence-00771580" target="_blank">Politico</a>. This led him to review “some sensitive compartmented intelligence programs, which are among the most highly classified material stored by U.S. spy agencies.” This move is unusual given that Olsen has “no known experience working with the U.S. spy community.”</p><p>The CIA later confirmed that the agency is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-plan-nationalize-us-elections">working with Olsen</a>. “The president has asked Olsen to look at intelligence related to the 2020 election and the agency is ensuring that he has the access necessary to do his work,” a CIA spokesperson told Politico. This all comes as many are sounding the alarm about his involvement. Olsen has a “history of abusing his law license to spread lies about our elections,” Christine P. Sun, a senior vice president at the States United Democracy Center, told the Times. “Now, he’s using his role in the administration and the power of the federal government to take actions fueled by those same lies.”</p>

                                <h2 id="what-happened-2">What happened</h2><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Hungary Monday and reiterated President Donald Trump’s “extraordinarily close relationship” with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is facing a tough re-election fight after nearly 16 years in power. Orbán’s main challenger in the April 12 vote, Péter Magyar of the center-right Tisza party, launched his campaign to unseat his former ally on Sunday, pledging to fight corruption and restore Hungary’s alignment toward Western Europe.</p><h2 id="who-said-what-2">Who said what</h2><p>Magyar, an influential member of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/victor-orban-hungary-succession">Orbán’s far-right nationalist Fidesz party</a> before breaking away in 2024, has quickly “grown Tisza” into a “formidable political force,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/hungary-opposition-campaign-orban-f4e2d7a7cc73a19cc0dbb18a7286835d" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a> said. “Most independent polls show Tisza with a significant lead” that “has held steady for more than a year.” Orbán’s “success in bringing the judiciary and media to heel” as he worked to “weaken democracy in Hungary” has “raised questions about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-plan-nationalize-us-elections">fairness of any election</a> in Hungary,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/world/europe/rubio-hungary-elections-orban-trump.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> said. But Magyar is giving him an “apparently tough challenge.”<br><br>Rubio’s attempt to throw Orbán a “political lifeline” is the “latest example of the Trump administration working to keep in power right-wing populist leaders” who offer “enthusiastic praise for Trump” and “are seen as ideologically aligned,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/02/16/rubio-hungary-orban-trump/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> said. Trump is “deeply committed to your success” and “we want this country to do well,” Rubio told Orbán, “especially as long as you’re the prime minister.”</p><h2 id="what-next-3">What next?</h2><p>Rubio’s “warm words” for Orbán “stopped short of a formal election endorsement,” but Trump himself endorsed the Hungarian leader last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/golden-age-marco-rubio-gushes-over-viktor-orban-pre-election-meeting/" target="_blank">Politico</a> said. Orbán is “also expected to travel to Washington this week for the inaugural meeting of Trump’s Board of Peace.”</p>

                                <h2 id="what-happened-3">What happened</h2><p>Thomas Pritzker Monday stepped down as executive chair of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation, citing his “terrible judgment in maintaining contact” with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt fortune, is one of the most prominent Americans felled by an association with the late sex offender in the wake of the Justice Department’s release of millions of documents from its Epstein investigations.</p><h2 id="who-said-what-3">Who said what</h2><p>The “latest round of the Epstein files has effectively ended the careers of some of the world’s most powerful figures, from captains of industry to prominent attorneys,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/16/epstein-associates-consequences-usa-world" target="_blank">Axios</a> said. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/crime/the-epstein-files-glimpses-of-a-deeply-disturbing-world">The fallout</a> has been swifter overseas, including police investigations of former French Culture Minister Jack Lang, former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjorn Jagland and former British U.S. Ambassador Peter Mandelson, and potentially of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem of Dubai was ousted as chair and CEO of logistics firm DP World. <br><br>Pritzker, 75, joins a growing list of Americans also losing their jobs due to revelations <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/new-epstein-files-dump-denials-elites">in the Epstein files</a>. In the last two weeks, Brad Karp stepped down as longtime head of the law firm Paul Weiss, Kathryn Ruemmler said she will resign as Goldman Sachs general counsel in June, and Casey Wasserman is selling his prominent Hollywood talent agency. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/17/us/video/mayor-bass-la-28-olympics-casey-wasserman-bash-digvid-vrtc" target="_blank">CNN</a> Monday she thought Wasserman “should step down” as chair of the L.A. 2028 Olympics committee, too. <br><br>Still, some “prominent Americans” with documented ties to Epstein, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-epstein-relationship-timeline-maxwell">President Donald Trump</a> and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, “have so far largely kept their positions of power,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/14/nx-s1-5714609/epstein-europe-fallout" target="_blank">NPR</a> said. Stephen Bannon maintained daily contact with Epstein “when many of his friends were abandoning him,” offering advice on “how to handle resurrected allegations that he was a serial pedophile” up until Epstein’s arrest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/us/politics/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> said.</p><h2 id="what-next-4">What next?</h2><p>“The revelations aren’t stopping,” Axios said, “with new names — and new recriminations — coming to light every day.” New Mexico lawmakers Monday passed legislation to open a bipartisan “truth commission” into Epstein’s Zorro Ranch outside Santa Fe, where he is “accused of trafficking and sexually assaulting girls and women,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-mexico-approves-comprehensive-probe-epsteins-zorro-ranch-2026-02-17/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> said. The investigation, which begins today and will deliver interim findings in July, “could pose risks” to any politicians, scientists, investors and “other high-profile individuals who visited the ranch.”</p>

                                <p>Moscow is calling it “necro-propaganda” but intelligence services and chemical weapons experts from five European countries are united in their verdict: Russian opposition leader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/politics/putin-critic-alexei-navalny-dies-in-prison">Alexei Navalny</a> was killed by a rare toxin found in some poison dart frogs.</p><p>Traces of epibatidine, a neurotoxin 200 times more potent than morphine, were found in samples taken from Navalny’s body after he died, two years ago, in a Siberian penal colony. Only the Russian government had “the means, the motive and the opportunity” to use such a poison on a prisoner, said Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.</p><p>“Precise, deniable” and “grimly familiar”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia/dart-frog-poison-believed-killed-alexei-navalny-points-kremlin-rcna259131" target="_blank">NBC</a>, the use of poison to eliminate enemies “has become less a medieval cliché” than Russia’s current “geopolitical signature flourish”.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-history-of-russia-s-use-of-poison">What is the history of Russia’s use of poison?</h2><p>The Kremlin has long used rare poisons “to dispose of inconvenient people”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/navalny-poison-dart-frog-russia-putin-b2920771.html" target="_blank">The Independent</a>. There are credible reports of a Soviet “poison programme” as far back as the 1920s. Poison was mainly used to eliminate internal opposition but, in 1978, the Western world was shocked by the London assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/articles/465436/what-ricin-exactly">ricin</a>-filled pellet, fired from the tip of an umbrella on Waterloo Bridge.</p><p>In recent years, Russian military and security services have been implicated in a growing number of high-profile poison attacks overseas. In 2004, Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yuschenko, running against a Russian favourite, was left permanently disfigured by a dioxin attack. In 2006, Russian defector <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/62377/what-happened-to-alexander-litvinenko">Alexander Litvinenko</a> died after drinking a cup of tea laced with radioactive polonium-210 in a London hotel. And, in 2018, two Russian GRU agents were implicated in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/94814/novichok-nerve-agents-what-they-do-to-your-body">novichok</a> attack on former spy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/763961/police-russian-exspy-sergei-skripal-daughter-poisoned-front-door">Sergei Skripal</a> and his daughter in Salisbury.</p><p>Two years later, an attempt was made to kill Navalny with novichok during a flight to Moscow but he survived after his plane was diverted so he could be taken to hospital. This was, however, only a temporary reprieve for Vladimir Putin’s most vocal and effective critic.</p><h2 id="why-is-poison-the-kremlin-s-weapon-of-choice">Why is poison the Kremlin’s weapon of choice?</h2><p>The advantage of toxins is “their deniability and terror”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/navalny-alexei-death-poisoning-82nbtf7r5" target="_blank">The Times</a>. They send “a very clear message: ‘If you screw with us, terrible things will happen’”, a security source told the paper. Not only can the state kill but “it can do so without ever admitting it has done anything at all”.</p><p>The effects of epibatidine, the toxin said to be used in Navalny’s fatal poisoning, are “devastating’, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.sky.com/story/why-navalny-dart-frog-poison-announcement-was-deliberately-timed-13507725" target="_blank">Sky News</a>. It will cause “paralysis, respiratory arrest and an agonising death”. If the Kremlin “did choose to use such an exotic substance to silence a critic, it demonstrates an unusual level of ruthlessness”.</p><h2 id="will-there-be-any-consequences-for-russia">Will there be any consequences for Russia?</h2><p>A group of European ministers have reported the results of their lab tests on the Navalny samples to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Russia claims “Western fabulists” are using a Russian citizen’s death to make “strident accusations” of assassination with “zero evidence”.</p><p>The “extraordinary announcement” about the frog poison at an international security conference in Munich was deliberately co-ordinated by the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands “to grab global headlines in much the same way as” Navalny's “actual death did”, said Sky News. “The intent was to make sure perpetrators cannot hide in the shadows.” Potential repercussions could include sanctions or even criminal prosecutions of individuals involved.</p><p>The hope is that this kind of “greater scrutiny“ will “deter the Kremlin” from poison attacks overseas. It is, “at the very least, evidence of a growing resolve amongst Nato allies” to stand up to Putin.</p><p>And, “in the short term, the main international consequence” will be “to make it impossible” for America’s European allies “to swallow any Trump <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/world-news/trump-new-ukraine-peace-plan">peace plan for Ukraine</a> that rewards Putin”, said  The Independent. “Poison, it turns out, can be a boomerang.”</p>

                                <p>“Sporting matching signet rings” engraved with “poetics about their twinned souls”, Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi are the latest on-screen lovers hinting at off-screen romance, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/are-margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-dating-wuthering-heights-xjbg2wz9r" target="_blank">The Times</a>. As publicity for the much-awaited new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/wuthering-heights-wildly-fun-reinvention-lacks-depth">film adaptation of “Wuthering Heights”</a> reaches “fever pitch”, its leads have been leaning into the fantasy with a series of “entwined” interviews and touchy-feely red carpet moments.</p><p>“This is not a case of life imitating art” – Robbie has been married to producer Tom Ackerley since 2016, and they had their first child in 2024 – but a particularly shameless “showmance”, “a relationship cultivated by two stars to catapult a film into the zeitgeist”.</p><h2 id="planet-vomit">‘Planet Vomit’</h2><p>Even before the film hit UK cinemas, the “Byronic showmance” between its stars was “moving at warp speed to Planet Vomit”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2026/02/09/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights-showmance/" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>. During the promotional campaign, Elordi and Robbie have been “wrapped around each other like poison ivy, waxing lyrical about their ‘mutual obsession’”.</p><p>They have “tried really, really hard to make everyone think they are besotted lovers”, rather than “professional colleagues with a product to sell”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/jan/28/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights-press-tour-fauxmance" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>. Is this how stupid the film industry thinks we become? Something’s “badly wrong” if we all have to watch them “go moony-eyed over each other, knowing full well they’ll drop the artifice like a stone when they each get something new to promote”.</p><p>Even platonic friendship isn’t safe from this Hollywood hysteria. While promoting “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/wicked-fails-to-defy-gravity">Wicked</a>” and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/culture-life/film/is-wicked-for-good-defying-expectations">sequel</a>, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo were “clinging to each other” and “sobbing like they’d just watched their childhood houses burn down”. Did we not once understand that “an actor’s performance began with the opening credits and ended when the lights went up”?</p><h2 id="fabricated-pairings">‘Fabricated pairings’</h2><p>Hollywood has actually been here before – when “the old school studios ordered a young starlet to marry her co-star to promote a new release or a pair of teen sensations were asked to prolong a spent relationship”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tatler.com/article/hollywood-showmances-taylor-swift-travis-kelce" target="_blank">Tatler</a>.</p><p>In the Golden Age, big studios like MGM and Universal “locked in” stars with “golden-handcuff contracts”, said The Times. They made them sign morality clauses to control their off-screen love life, and forced them to participate in “fabricated romantic pairings” to promote movies – or even sometimes to “deflect rumours”. In 1955, Universal arranged for closeted gay heartthrob Rock Hudson to be married off to his agent’s secretary amid swirling speculation about his sexuality.</p><p>Today’s showmances are less formally planned, Hollywood marketing agent Stacy Jones told the paper. The idea is to generate speculation without explicitly confirming a romance: “never lie, but don’t rush to clarify either”. It’s all “about amplifying chemistry that already feels believable”.</p><p>But toying with audiences like this can backfire. Many people “seemed genuinely moved” when Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson appeared to have fallen for one another while making “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/the-naked-gun-liam-neeson-reviews">The Naked Gun</a>”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://slate.com/life/2025/08/pamela-anderson-liam-neeson-dating-age-movie.html" target="_blank">Slate</a> – only for the whole affair to be revealed as a “sloppily executed” showmance the moment the promotional tour was over. “If you’re going to fake a relationship, celebs, could you just be prepared to stick it out at least until the movie goes to streaming?”</p>

                                <p>With its pretty pastel houses, shimmering blue water and rugged hills, few places are quite as beautiful as the Amalfi Coast. The dramatic setting has inspired countless writers, including Patricia Highsmith who first visited Positano in the 1950s. From her hotel balcony early one morning, she spotted a pensive young man walking alone on the beach – a chance sighting that sparked the idea for her novel “The Talented Mr. Ripley”.</p><p>Spring is a wonderful time of year to visit, before the crowds descend for the summer months. And while there are plenty of lavish hotels scattered among the clifftop towns, there are more affordable options too. Here is our mini guide to the Amalfi Coast for a taste of <em>la dolce vita</em>.</p><h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2><p>Ravello, “the region’s dreamiest hill town”, is a great place to start, said Louise Roddon in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/travel/destinations/europe-travel/italy/best-things-to-do-amalfi-coast-5r32nkkvv?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqcuFL67KMiMUXZRqEgbu2B8g5bnjovSKrogIN3UIKNOEiu3Alz5HksmkPDMOPA%3D&gaa_ts=698f1bad&gaa_sig=hMcV8qhRQBxbc9CaubQaCii75ziPGyB4arTT3zhWz-TpQepoO3aV6N5ztRMsabZ416dl1cKeEtk8qHsTtWzC_Q%3D%3D" target="_blank"><u>The Times</u></a>. Wander through the medieval streets, then stop by at “the elaborate villas of Rufolo and Cimbrone, each set within highly romantic gardens”. The former inspired scenes from Richard Wagner’s “Parsifal” and boasts a terrace with a “wonderful sunset lookout along the coast”.</p><p>“If it’s warm – actually, even if it’s not – get out on the water,” said Elise Taylor in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/amalfi-coast-italy-travel-guide" target="_blank"><u>Vogue</u></a>. Be sure to book a boat trip during your stay; the “most popular swimming hole” is Grotta della Smeraldo – a tranquil cave in Conca dei Marini (between Amalfi and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/travel/villa-treville-positano-a-glamorous-sanctuary-on-the-amalfi-coast">Positano</a>).</p><p>And if you want to get a feel for the area but don’t fancy braving the “squiggly hairpin bends” of the famed Amalfi coast road, consider hopping on the Sita bus which stops at towns all along the Sorrentine peninsula. It’s a great way to soak up the views of “lemon groves, pine-fringed bays, Saracen towers and pretty villages”.</p><p>For history buffs eager to “sample ancient Italy”, a trip to the “mesmerising ruins” of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/design-architecture/the-never-ending-wonder-of-pompeii">Pompeii</a> is a must, said Helena Smith in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/planning-perfect-trip-amalfi-coast-italy" target="_blank"><u>Lonely Planet</u></a>. “Achingly frozen in time” since the eruption of Vesuvius in 79AD, the city’s “frescoed homes, businesses and baths” remain waiting for their occupants to return.</p><h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to stay</h2><p>If it’s “unparalleled” views you’re after, then the Caruso Belmond Hotel is a safe bet, said Taylor in Vogue. Nestled on a cliff overlooking the coast in Ravello, the “dazzling historic gem” is set within an 11th-century former palace. From the moment you step through the door you’ll feel “whisked away to another era” while outside you’ll find a pool “which has a serious claim to being one of the most picturesque in the world”. Sipping a Caruso <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/culture-life/food-drink/spring-cocktails-mezcal-gin-bourbon">spritz</a> from one of the sun loungers while looking out at the sea is “about as close to <em>paradiso </em>as it gets”.</p><p>There are some excellent “mid-range B&Bs” too, said Smith in Lonely Planet. Stand-out options include “Casa Giovanni da Procida, prettily perched La Fenice in Positano and hillside Ercole di Amalfi, just outside Amalfi town”.</p><h2 id="eating-and-drinking">Eating and drinking</h2><p>“You’ll find spaghetti <em>alle vongole</em> (with fresh clams) on practically every menu in the region,” said Smith in Lonely Planet. And of course, the Amalfi Coast is within “dough-throwing distance” of Naples, which is home to some of Italy’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/articles/450172/how-make-perfect-pizza">best pizza</a>.</p><p>Or, for “pure in-your-face romance”, book a table at La Sponda in Positano, said Nicky Swallow in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/best-restaurants-amalfi-coast" target="_blank">Condé Nast Traveller</a>. The “dreamy” restaurant – which reopens at the end of March – features a “beautiful vaulted dining room” lit by “400-odd suspended candles” and an “equally atmospheric” terrace looking out over the “theatrically lit town”. Dishes are “unfussy” and delicious; expect classics like “spaghetti with lobster fished from the waters round Galli islands” and a “light-as-air hot lemon soufflé” made with fresh lemons from Amalfi.</p>

                                <p>Nearly 82,000 children in England are in the care of local authorities – close to record  levels – but there are nowhere near enough approved foster carers. To tackle this shortfall, the government has announced plans to create 10,000 new places for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/news/uk-news/954879/why-the-number-of-children-in-care-in-england-is-set-to-rise">vulnerable children</a> by 2029, as part of a £88 million pledge to overhaul the fostering system.</p><p>Increasing the number of foster carers is “an urgent priority”, said Josh MacAlister, minister for children and families. We’re “bringing fostering into the 21st century, removing outdated rules and unnecessary barriers to become foster carers”.</p><p>But experts say recruiting more carers won’t ease the retention crisis that is driving the shortfall. In England, the number of foster carers fell from 63,890 in 2021 to 56,345 in March 2025, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwngvlzgg4o" target="_blank">BBC</a>: a 12% decrease.</p><h2 id="what-did-the-commentators-say-2">What did the commentators say?</h2><p>“The foster care system in this country is collapsing,” said Mary Wakefield in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://spectator.com/article/the-painful-truth-about-foster-care/" target="_blank">The Spectator</a>. Every year, the pool of people prepared to care for vulnerable children shrinks. No wonder – “burnout and unbearable stress” have around 60% of foster carers saying they are considering or have already decided to withdraw from the system. The 2024 Budget included around £44 million to support regional fostering recruitment hubs, but “what’s the point of a grand recruitment drive if all you’re doing is ushering people towards a nervous breakdown?”</p><p>High rents, unstable or crowded housing and unpredictable work patterns “keep many under-35s out of fostering”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/foster-care-is-in-crisis-meet-the-young-people-stepping-up-dxp3ckxg6" target="_blank">The Times</a>. And “for younger carers in particular”, the lack of professional support “reinforces the sense that fostering is a world designed for older people”.</p><p>Several of MacAlister’s proposals target the “support systems” that surround carers, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/10/the-guardian-view-on-fostering-reform-is-welcome-but-excess-profits-must-be-tackled" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>.  These include calling for stronger collaboration between councils, grants for experienced carers to extend their homes to take on additional children, and specialist placements for young people on remand, “as an alternative to custody”. These are welcome ideas, as is speeding up the approval process, which currently takes longer than it does for prospective adopters.</p><p>But they are also familiar ideas, said Nick Martin on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.sky.com/story/an-uncomfortable-truth-must-be-confronted-to-turn-the-tide-on-foster-care-13503086" target="_blank">Sky News</a>. “For more than a decade, successive governments have announced plans to attract foster carers while quietly avoiding the harder question: why so many are leaving.” None of MacAlister’s (admittedly sensible) plans answers the question foster carers keep asking: “How are we meant to afford to do this?”</p><p>There are no UK guidelines for foster carer fees: rates “vary wildly”, yet often amount to “well below the minimum wage for what is effectively a 24/7 job” – and a stressful one. Private agencies are also “an elephant in the room”. They typically pay carers far more than local authorities, “at far greater cost to the public purse”. The government’s plan doesn’t “tackle that imbalance”.</p><p>The future of the care system rests on whether the government is “willing to confront the uncomfortable truth”: that fostering “relies on goodwill, personal sacrifice, and carers quietly subsidising the state. Until that changes, no amount of branding, roadshows or recruitment slogans is likely to stop the slow, steady exodus from a system many say is already at breaking point.”</p><h2 id="what-next-5">What next?</h2><p>There are still “significant gaps” in the plan, said The Guardian. “It is unclear who will lead and sustain” the proposed reforms, and there is also “little sign of firm action” on the “excessive profits” earned by private providers. “So far, pledges to end these amount to little more than threats.”</p><p>Sarah Thomas, CEO of the Fostering Network, would like to see fostering fees standardised. “Fees must also be competitive to bring more carers into the field,” she told The Times. “This is particularly relevant if services want to attract a greater skill level and for the public to see fostering as a viable role.”</p><p>Ultimately, said The Times, “this is not a job you can do for love alone.”</p>

                                <h2 id="wuthering-heights">‘Wuthering Heights’</h2><p>Directed by Emerald Fennell (R)</p><p>★★</p><p>“<em>Wuthering Heights</em> is Emerald Fennell’s dumbest movie,” said <strong>Alison Willmore</strong> in <em><strong>NYMag.com</strong></em>. “It also happens to be her best.” In her adaptation of Emily Brontë’s classic novel, the director of <em>Saltburn</em> and <em>Promising Young Woman</em> “throws off the burden of trying to say<br>something significant” and instead makes the legendary romance of Catherine and Heathcliff simply the story of two drama whores who can’t quit each other. “Fennell has an incredible talent for extravagant scenes that bypass all higher thought functions to spark a deeper lizard-brained pleasure,” and she leans fully into that talent here.</p><p>To me, Fennell’s “gleefully self-conscious” film style proves “an awkward fit for Brontë’s roiling, tormented saga of passion, cruelty, and doom,” said <strong>Nick Schager</strong> in the <em><strong>Daily Beast</strong></em>. Her “Cathy” and Heathcliff aren’t doomed to unrequited longing. Instead, even after Cathy marries for money and security, she and the poor-born Heathcliff “get down and dirty in bedrooms, carriages, and out on the moors,” squandering the talents of co-stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi and reducing the tale<br>to “florid, horny, juvenile fan fiction.” This is a movie that “should sell heaps of tickets,” said <strong>Daphne Merkin</strong> in <em><strong>Air Mail</strong></em>. “Influenced by the aesthetics of soft porn and high fashion,” it aims to win over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/business/economy/gen-z-credit-score-crisis-fixes">Gen Z</a> viewers, and in its own “edgy, stylistic” way, “it works.” Still, by allowing the lovers to act on their hunger for each other and by leaving out Catherine’s post-mortem haunting of Heathcliff, Fennell’s <em>Wuthering</em><br><em>Heights</em> turns out to be “a less radical rendering of the otherworldly desire that Brontë captured almost two centuries ago.”</p><h2 id="good-luck-have-fun-don-t-die">‘Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die’</h2><p>Directed by Gore Verbinski (R)</p><p>★★★</p><p>“There’s zero doubt, watching this film, that it was made by a madman,” said <strong>Eric Vespe</strong> in <em><strong>The Film Stage</strong></em>. From the moment Sam Rockwell bursts into a busy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/hollywood-losing-luster-production">Los Angeles</a> diner as a wild-eyed character claiming to be a time traveler from a grim future, “it’s clear you’re not in for a movie<br>made by committee.” Instead, the ride you’ve strapped in for is the first from <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> director Gore Verbinski in nearly a decade, and though the 134-minute adventure runs long, “it’s never dull, in part because it’s so hard to predict what’s coming next.”</p><p>Nothing in Verbinski’s sci-fi action comedy would work without Rockwell, said <strong>Peter Debruge</strong> in <em><strong>Variety</strong></em>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/ai-films-academy-awards">Oscar</a> winner’s crackpot interloper<br>announces that he needs help to avert AI’s future uprising against humanity, and as he picks his team from the diner’s patrons, a routine he’s ostensibly carried out 117 times before in precisely the same location, Rockwell “makes a great avatar for the cavalier stance that nothing<br>matters when you get endless lives.” Soon, the mission team includes Juno Temple’s single mom and Haley Lu Richardson’s sad-eyed punk, and we’re treated to a “virtuoso” orchestration of <em>Everything Everywhere</em><br><em>All at Once</em>–style time-travel anomalies. The screenplay lacks the sharp teeth that would elevate <em>Good Luck</em> to a high-concept classic, said <strong>David Rooney</strong> in <em><strong>The Hollywood Reporter</strong></em>. Still, “Verbinski’s flair for kinetic action set pieces make it a reasonably entertaining entry in the canon of gonzo sci-fi comedies.”</p><h2 id="sirat">‘Sirat’</h2><p>Directed by Oliver Laxe (R)</p><p>★★★★</p><p>“You might have a few reasonable guesses where this story is headed. They’re probably wrong,” said <strong>Amy Nicholson</strong> in the <em><strong>Los Angeles Times</strong></em>. Spain’s “punkish, prankish, and strangely existential” contender for the Best International Feature Oscar opens with a rave in the<br>Moroccan desert at which we see a father and his young son asking the whacked-out revelers whether any have seen the boy’s missing older sister. The party is then broken up by soldiers bearing the news that something like World War III has broken out, and suddenly, Oliver Laxe’s “taut and riveting” drama is tracking the father, his son, and a break-off group of ravers racing farther into the desert.</p><p>Though the movie “begins in exhilaration and concludes in despair,”<br>said <strong>Justin Chang</strong> in<em><strong> The New Yorker</strong></em>, its narrative “takes off like a shot” and never flags while its “mysterious” power emanates from the makers’<br>“tough-minded understanding” that human kindness is “rare yet persistent,” even in the direst circumstances. “Laxe offers a much too<br>literal takeaway during the film’s final moments,” said <strong>Natalia Keogan</strong> in the <em><strong>A.V. Club</strong></em>. “But as the cliché advises, it’s the journey <em>Sirat</em> takes us on that merits appreciation.” And if the world is truly ending, “maybe one last party, one last dose of serotonin, isn’t such a bad send-off.”</p>

                                <p>Hong Kong is a city of two halves: Hong Kong Island is the business hub, where many of the tourist sights are located, while Kowloon is part of the mainland, which is considered more traditional and authentic. There you can find cheaper food and shopping options.</p><p>Regent Hong Kong in Tsim Sha Tsui occupies a prime spot overlooking Victoria Harbour in Kowloon, with a recent and extensive two-year makeover making it a contender for one of the most fashionable hotels in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/travel/discover-the-other-side-of-hong-kong"><u>Hong Kong</u></a>.</p><h2 id="why-stay-here">Why stay here?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G42YiEqKXpDcjmVv63A86f" name="regent-exterior" alt="Regent Hong Kong exterior at night" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G42YiEqKXpDcjmVv63A86f.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The main draw of Regent Hong Kong is its waterfront location </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Regent Hong Kong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After a relaxing flight via Helsinki on Finnair in a swish business-class seat that transforms into a super-comfortable bed, I was excited to check in.</p><p>Formerly known as the Intercontinental Hong Kong, Regent Hong Kong has been lovingly rebranded and revamped by furniture designer and architect Chi Wing Lo. When you step inside the main lobby you’re greeted by a colourful LED wall showing specially commissioned video art and glass walls crafted using a local glass-making technique. It’s clear that its take on luxury is much more playful and cutting edge than other five-star offerings in the city.</p><p>The main draw of Regent Hong Kong is its waterfront location and it makes the most of its harbour views. There’s a stylish lounge area that has high floor-to-ceiling walls looking out to the always bustling promenade, while the focal point of its harbour rooms are the windows, styled to look like picture frames, so you can take in Hong Kong’s beautiful skyline. A long daybed rests below the window so you can while away the hours watching as day turns into night and the city’s skyscrapers start to beam the Symphony of Lights, a colourful light show each night at 8pm.</p><p>Rooms are decorated in a neutral palette with beige carpets, tactile patterned walls, and yellow chairs. Ceilings feature a huge gold circular cut-out in lieu of a chandelier that gives the rooms a space age feel. The bathroom, featuring Perricone MD toiletries, is just as stylish with bronze taps and brown leather dressing tables. To enhance the feeling of natural light inside, LED panels that glow with a marbled pattern can be found in the hallway, bathroom and toilet. The bathroom also has a Japanese-style bath with a seat so you can sit down properly instead of lying down while soaking in the tub. Bliss.</p><h2 id="eating-and-drinking-2">Eating and drinking </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5JmtSDuzo7JkcX8C34ZCD9" name="nobu-regent-hong-kong" alt="Nobu restaurant at Regent Hong Kong" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5JmtSDuzo7JkcX8C34ZCD9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Hong Kong branch of the famous celebrity hotspot Nobu </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Regent Hong Kong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You’ll never go hungry at Regent Hong Kong. The hotel caters to a wide range of tastes with six restaurants and bars, including the Hong Kong branch of the famous celebrity hotspot Nobu, which serves up Japanese-Peruvian fusion cuisine.</p><p>Breakfast is a decadent affair served up at Harbourside. With its super high ceilings, giant lamp shades and walls of plants, it’s a bright and airy place to dig into a huge buffet while watching people walking along the promenade. Along with the usual array of eggs, cereal and delectable Danishes, it also offers Asian breakfast options like congee, crispy youtiao and custard baos. There’s a noodle-making station, a section with cold cuts and fresh fruit as well as cooked dishes like ginger braised chicken. You can eat your way around the world in one morning sampling curry samosas and Korean-style fish cakes.</p><p>Guests at the hotel also get access to Regent Club, a soothing space on the second floor where they can enjoy afternoon tea with a spread of delicious cakes, egg tarts and pastries, and exquisite finger sandwiches that are slightly more adventurous than the normal fare like smoked salmon with avocado wasabi and salmon roe.</p><p>You’re spoilt for choice when it comes to dinner. We dined at Lai Ching Heen, a two-Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant, one night. There, we sampled a tasting menu with each beautifully presented dish more delicious than the last. Stuffed crabmeat was served up in its shell, the flesh turned into a beautifully creamy concoction with onion and milk. Wok-fried prawns with homemade XO sauce were plump and juicy. Tender wagyu beef was served up with mushrooms. Dessert was a Hong Kong classic – mango pudding, accompanied with lychee sorbet and a crispy sesame dumpling filled with pineapple and custard cream. The whole meal was exquisite and one of the best I had during a long trip around Asia.</p><h2 id="things-to-do">Things to do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qxt2uKaxjbe3pXozci5GbF" name="rgeent-staircase" alt="Staircase at Regent Hong Kong" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qxt2uKaxjbe3pXozci5GbF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The grand staircase at Regent Hong Kong  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Regent Hong Kong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regent Hong Kong is next to K11 MUSEA, a shopping mall full of expensive brands like Loewe and Alexander McQueen, and K11 Art Mall, which has cheaper options including chainstore Owndays, where you can pick up cheap prescription glasses in 30 minutes. A few MTR stations away is Mong Kok, which is the place to go for bargain shopping in Hong Kong – try out your haggling skills at the Ladies' Market. Remember: never accept the first price.</p><p>The hotel is also a short walk to the Tsim Sha Tsui ferry station where you can catch the iconic Star Ferry for a quick 10-minute trip to Central on Hong Kong Island. From there, you have your pick of the other major Hong Kong islands to visit for a day trip. I headed to Cheung Chau, a beautiful dumbbell-shaped island an hour from Central on the ferry, famous for its fresh fruit mochi, giant fish-ball skewers dipped in curry sauce and stunning hiking trails.</p><h2 id="the-verdict">The verdict </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="66jWVoKNpAkjRUDGjzzCLR" name="regent-pool (2)" alt="Regent Hong Kong infinity pool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/66jWVoKNpAkjRUDGjzzCLR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Guests can soak up the views from the infinity pool </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Regent Hong Kong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regent Hong Kong is like the coolest art gallery, sexiest nightclub and most elegant private members establishment all rolled into one playfully luxurious space.

                                <p>There has been a growing demand in recent years to separate “profound autism” into its own diagnosis, outside current parameters.</p><p>Since 2013, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/health/human-evolution-autism-genes-causes">autism</a> diagnoses have been split into three levels, ranging from “some support required” to “requires very substantial support”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theautismservice.co.uk/news/types-of-autism-explained/" target="_blank">The Autism Service</a>.</p><p>Support for the addition of the “profound autism” category, first proposed in 2022 by a board of international experts in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01541-5/abstract" target="_blank">The Lancet</a>, is gaining traction. Some experts think it will bring welcome care to those who require it most, while others say it could mean other members of the autistic community are neglected.</p><h2 id="what-is-profound-autism">What is profound autism?</h2><p>The proposed term would describe individuals with autism who “have little or no language (spoken, written, signed or via a communication device), who have an IQ of less than 50, and who require 24-hour supervision and support”, said Kelsie Boulton, Marie Antoinette Hodge and Rebecca Sutherland on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-diagnosis-of-profound-autism-is-on-the-cards-heres-what-could-change-271930" target="_blank">The Conversation</a>. This category would only be diagnosable for ages eight and over, when individuals’ “cognitive and communication abilities are considered more stable”.</p><p>In their study of 513 autistic children assessed between 2019 and 2024, the researchers found that around 24% of participants met, or were at risk of meeting, the criteria for profound autism.</p><h2 id="how-has-understanding-evolved">How has understanding evolved?</h2><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/1025265/rfk-jr-controversies">US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr</a> claimed last autumn that there was an “epidemic” of autism across his country, falsely linking it with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/instant-opinion-tylenol-disney-trump-israel">vaccines or Tylenol</a>, which is known as paracetamol in the UK. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-promotes-unproven-tylenol-autism-link">“unproven and debunked” claims</a> about the causes of autism “threatens public health, even as officials funnel more money into research”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/profound-autism-asd-trump-rfk-jr-dd46d3c79dd4b5afc4d23943a358e844" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>.</p><p>Autism rates have been on the rise “for decades”, but there are solid reasons for this, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/mass-people-united-states-target-bluey-b2920727.html" target="_blank">The Independent</a>. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, adopted in 2013, is now “very broad”, including many people with low support needs, and there is “better awareness of the condition”, leading to more diagnoses.</p><p>The concept of an autistic “spectrum” has been widely accepted since it was coined in the 1980s by psychiatrist Dr Lorna Wing. “Groundbreaking” at the time, her work “transformed how autism was understood in the UK”, said Aimee Grant on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/why-its-time-to-rethink-the-notion-of-an-autism-spectrum-263243" target="_blank">The Conversation</a>. Previously, autism had been seen as a “rare, narrowly defined condition”, whereas since a “wide range of traits and experiences” have been recognised.</p><p>The introduction of new terms to categorise the spectrum is not without precedent. Wing also introduced the term “Asperger’s syndrome” to the UK. It was intended to divide or categorise patients depending on their care needs. Individuals with Asperger’s tended to have lower support needs.</p><p>However, the term was “retired” in the 2013 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders following revelations about Hans Asperger’s links to the Nazi regime, said the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism/the-history-of-autism/asperger-syndrome" target="_blank">National Autistic Society</a>. He was responsible for “abhorrent descriptions of some autistic children as being less ‘worthwhile’ than others”, and “more recent research” has shown that Asperger “was aware that he was sending children to their death”.</p><h2 id="why-is-the-new-definition-needed">Why is the new definition needed?</h2><p>Having a more specific category in future clinical guidelines could allow governments, disability services and clinicians to plan and deliver support more effectively, said Boulton, Hodge and Sutherland on The Conversation. Due to the broadening of the current spectrum, it is possible that people with the highest needs are “overlooked”, so the new category would “re-balance their under-representation in mainstream autism research”.</p><p>Current understanding of an autistic spectrum ranging from “mild” to “severe” can be “misleading”, said Grant. “The term has outlived its usefulness.” The condition has “lots of unique combinations”, including reliance on routine, “stimming” or “monotropism”. “Because autism is made up of all these different elements, there can be no single line on which every autistic person is placed.”</p><h2 id="what-are-the-arguments-against-it">What are the arguments against it?</h2><p>However, some experts would say the new category is “unhelpful”, said Grant. “It tells us nothing about a person’s particular challenges or the type of support they require.”</p><p>Some autistic self-advocates see “unity as the best protection for everyone on the spectrum” and being “part of one shared story”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisonescalante/2025/10/24/would-a-new-diagnosis-of-profound-autism-help-autistic-people/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. Similarly, some people in the autistic community fear that creating a separate diagnosis would “reduce attention on the broader spectrum and the individual needs of everyone on it”, said The Independent.</p>

                                <p>Alongside saving, investing is a cornerstone of building wealth. It is not always easy to know where to get started, however, in part due to the sheer range of possible investment options. Should you dive straight into stocks? What about ETFs and mutual funds? And how do bonds fit into the whole picture?</p><p>If your head already feels like it’s spinning, don’t fret: “With the right tools and resources, investing can be much easier than you’d expect” — and “you don’t need a lot of money to get started,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/article/how-to-start-investing" target="_blank"><u>Vanguard</u></a>, a top investing company. Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id="what-investments-are-good-choices-for-beginners">What investments are good choices for beginners?</h2><p>Arguably, the best starter investment is likely one you are already familiar with: your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/retirement-account-options-401k-ira"><u>retirement plan</u></a>. “Why? Contributions are taken right out of your paycheck, which helps you build an investing habit,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/learn/investments-for-beginners" target="_blank"><u>NerdWallet</u></a>, plus you may get the added bonus of an employment match (essentially free money) and the tax benefits associated with some types of accounts, like 401(k) plans.</p><p>Beyond that, some solid options to consider are funds — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/what-to-know-about-investing-in-etfs"><u>exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</u></a>, index funds and mutual funds — because they effectively offer a short-cut to owning a range of investments, which means your portfolio will not rely too much on the performance of any one investment. Mutual funds, for instance, “give you the opportunity to invest in a basket of stocks or bonds (or other assets) that you might not be able to easily build on your own,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-investments-for-beginners/" target="_blank"><u>Bankrate</u></a>.</p><h2 id="what-should-you-consider-when-building-your-portfolio">What should you consider when building your portfolio?</h2><p>Just as important as <em>what</em> investments you choose for your investment portfolio is an understanding of <em>why</em> you are investing. Common investment goals include: being able to retire someday, covering the cost of a child’s education or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/saving-for-house-down-payment"><u>saving up for a house</u></a>.</p><p>Your specific goals will also provide some clarity on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/investing-short-term-versus-long-term-goals"><u>investment timeline</u></a> and the level of risk it is reasonable to take on. For example, the “longer you have to reach your goal, the more time you have to weather market ups and downs, which means you may be comfortable taking on more risk,” said Vanguard. Risk tolerance also comes down to personal comfort, as some people can stomach market swings better than others.</p><p>Also take into consideration just how involved with the management of your portfolio you would like to be. This can partly shape your strategy —  for instance, a “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/hands-off-investing"><u>passive investor</u></a> typically buys low-cost, diversified mutual funds or ETFs, and holds them for the long term,” whereas “active investors generally choose individual investments or mutual funds that aim to outperform the market,” said Bankrate. It also may indicate whether you want to outsource some of the work, such as through a robo-adviser.</p><p>Lastly, do not overlook the importance of diversification. Basically, this entails “choosing a variety of investment types,” which in turn can “help lower your risk and improve your chances of achieving your investment goals,” said Vanguard.</p><h2 id="when-should-you-start-investing">When should you start investing?</h2><p>In short, now. If you have any cash flow to spare (and let’s be honest, most budgets do if you look closely), then it is one of the biggest financial favors you can do for your future self.</p><p>“Investing is crucial if you want to maintain the purchasing power of your savings and reach long-term financial goals like retirement or building wealth,” said Bankrate. Otherwise, if left to sit in savings, “eventually inflation will decrease the value of your hard-earned cash.”</p>

                                <p>Your credit card’s APR, or annual percentage rate, is an important figure to pay attention to, especially if you do not pay off your card’s balance in full each and every statement cycle. The APR represents the interest rate you are charged on a credit card balance that remains after the card’s due date, and it can make a sizable difference in how much you ultimately have to pay to zero out your balance.</p><p>While credit card APRs have always been notoriously high, especially in comparison to other forms of borrowing, they have gotten even steeper in recent years. The “average interest rate on a commercial credit card is nearly 21% these days, according to Federal Reserve data,” which is “nearly double the rate seen 10 years ago,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-are-credit-card-rates-so-high-2026-what-experts-say/" target="_blank"><u>CBS News</u></a>. So how can you know whether the rate you are quoted is better — or worse — than what is typical?</p><h2 id="what-is-a-good-apr-for-a-credit-card">What is a good APR for a credit card?</h2><p>Technically speaking, the “best APR you can get on a credit card is 0%,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/credit-cards/learn/what-is-a-good-apr-for-a-credit-card" target="_blank"><u>NerdWallet</u></a>. That is a deal that will not last forever, though, as credit cards that do offer a 0% APR only do so for a brief promotional period, after which the card’s “interest rate resets to the ongoing APR,” said the outlet.</p><p>Otherwise, a helpful benchmark to look at is the current average credit card APR, which is data the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/what-is-federal-reserve-how-does-it-work"><u>Federal Reserve</u></a> provides. If your card is below that average, then it is likely a good rate. That said, “even a credit card at the national average can be considered a decent option, especially if you’re looking at one of today’s best credit cards that comes with rewards, bonuses and perks that can help offset any fees,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/zero-interest/good-apr-for-credit-card/" target="_blank"><u>Bankrate</u></a>.</p><h2 id="how-are-credit-card-aprs-determined">How are credit card APRs determined?</h2><p>A major determinant of credit card APRs is the prime rate, which tracks the Federal Reserve’s target federal funds rate range. Based on that, “credit card issuers set their APRs by adding their profit margin (usually about 12% to 13%) to the prime rate,” said Bankrate.</p><p>Different types of cards also have different APRs. For instance, “if you’re looking for a high-value rewards credit card with premium benefits, you can count on a high APR,” whereas “some cards designed for beginner cardholders or those looking to improve their credit may have slightly lower interest rates,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/article/credit-card-apr-205613548.html" target="_blank"><u>Yahoo Finance</u></a>.</p><p>Your credit score heavily influences the APR you get, too. As you may expect, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/high-credit-score-worth-it"><u>higher credit score</u></a> can generally land you a more favorable APR.</p><h2 id="how-can-you-qualify-for-a-better-apr">How can you qualify for a better APR?</h2><p>While you may “not be able to control all factors that determine your APR, you can be proactive in maintaining or polishing your creditworthiness,” said NerdWallet. In turn, this may lead to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/tips-for-lower-credit-card-apr"><u>lower credit card APR</u></a>. To improve your score, do the following:</p><ul><li>Consistently pay your bills on time.</li><li>Keep your credit utilization rate (the amount of your total available credit you are currently using) as low as possible.</li><li>Avoid applying for multiple new borrowing opportunities at once, as this will result in multiple hard inquiries, which temporarily lower your score.</li><li>Monitor your credit report to look for any errors or issues affecting your score.</li></ul>

                                <p>When “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie’s 84-year-old mother, Nancy, was kidnapped on February 1, 2026, it was the first major kidnapping to spark a media frenzy in many years. Such episodes, prior to the ubiquity of surveillance cameras and advances in forensics, were much more common, including these watershed events.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-charles-lindbergh-jr-1932"><span>Charles Lindbergh, Jr. (1932)</span></h3><p>The abduction and murder of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh’s infant son on March 1, 1932, was at the time considered the “crime of the century.” Lindbergh’s 1927 journey from New York to Paris was the first successful solo transatlantic flight and made him a household name.</p><p>“Awareness of the case was such that anyone seen with a small blonde child was looked at twice,” said Kase Wickman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/lindbergh-baby-kidnapping-savannah-guthrie-nancy?srsltid=AfmBOoqt7p9TCEnEbtlyoL6FjaW6ydt4vbh4uuLt9MkGiqUcncMEtF3v" target="_blank"><u>Vanity Fair</u></a>. Despite a frantic search that involved more than 100,000 people, the boy had likely been killed the night of the kidnapping, and his body was discovered 72 days later near the family’s home in Hopewell, New Jersey. A German immigrant named Bruno Richard Hauptmann was tried, convicted and executed for the crime.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-adolph-coors-iii-1960"><span>Adolph Coors III (1960)</span></h3><p>On February 9, 1960, 44-year-old Adolph Coors III, the grandson of the company’s founder, vanished. His car was found on the Turkey Creek Bridge near Denver, where he had been abducted by an escaped murderer, Joseph Corbett, looking for a quick get-rich scheme.</p><p>“The attempt went awry though and ended right there on that bridge” when Corbett shot Coors to death, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cpr.org/show-segment/death-of-an-heir-recounts-the-notorious-kidnapping-turned-murder-of-adolph-coors-iii/" target="_blank"><u>Colorado Public Radio</u></a>. His wife, Mary, received a $500,000 ransom demand the next day, and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover dispatched an enormous operation to find the beverage heir. Coors’ body was discovered on September 15, 1960, and the FBI later traced a car matching a witness description to Corbett. Corbett was convicted and sentenced to life in prison but released on parole in 1980.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-frank-sinatra-jr-1963"><span>Frank Sinatra, Jr. (1963)</span></h3><p>19 year-old Frank Sinatra, Jr., the son of one of the most renowned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/best-singers-turned-actors-cher-streisand-sinatra"><u>musicians and actors</u></a> of his generation, was kidnapped from a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California, on December 8, 1963. Two men, Barry Keenan and Joe Amsler, tied up Sinatra, Jr.’s friend, John Foss, and spirited the singer to Canoga Park, California, where they contacted his father and issued a demand for a $240,000 ransom, which Sinatra delivered early in the morning on December 11.</p><p>A third conspirator, John Irwin, spilled the beans to his brother, who contacted the police. The three men were sentenced to life in prison, though none served even five years. At his trial, Keenan “testified that the crime was a hoax, a publicity stunt coordinated with people tied to the family,” an allegation that was later disproven, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a37106130/frank-sinatra-jr-kidnapping-barry-keenan-true-story/" target="_blank"><u>Esquire</u></a>.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-paul-fronczak-1964"><span>Paul Fronczak (1964)</span></h3><p>A woman posed as a nurse at Chicago’s Michael Reese hospital and made off with a 1-day-old infant named Paul Fronczak on April 27, 1964, triggering what was then the largest manhunt in the city’s history. Two years later, the FBI found a child that they believed to be Paul in New Jersey and he was returned to his parents, Dora and Chester Fronczak.</p><p>But in 2012, Fronczak took a DNA test that proved he was actually Jack Rosenthal, an Atlantic City child who had vanished in 1965 along with his twin sister, Jill (who has still not been found). In 2019, it was revealed that the real Paul Fronczak had been raised as Kevin Baty by a woman named Lorraine Fountain. By then, both Baty and Fountain had passed away, and the original kidnapper remains unknown. Rosenthal still goes by Paul Fronczak and published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/True-Identity-Cracking-Kidnapping-Finding/dp/1642936677" target="_blank"><u>memoir</u></a> in 2022.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-john-paul-getty-iii-1973"><span>John Paul Getty III (1973)</span></h3><p>Getty III, the grandson of petroleum magnate John Paul Getty, was abducted by Italian gangsters in Rome on July 10, 1973, when he was 16. The kidnappers demanded $17 million, but the elder Getty initially refused, suspecting his wayward grandson of complicity and saying “If I pay one penny, I’ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren.”</p><p>He only agreed later to dispatch $2.2 million — after he received his grandson’s ear in the mail — the highest amount that could at the time be considered tax-deductible. Getty III struggled with drug and alcohol abuse and suffered a stroke in 1981 that would leave him disabled for the rest of his life until his death in 2011. The story was made into a 2017 film, “All the Money in the World,” as well as a 2018 FX limited series, “Trust.”</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-patricia-hearst-1974"><span>Patricia Hearst (1974)</span></h3><p>On February 4, 1974, 19 year-old Patricia Hearst, the heiress to William Randolph Hearst’s media dynasty, was kidnapped from her apartment in Berkeley, California, by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a far-left radical group. Two months later, she participated in a bank robbery, after which she was considered a fugitive until her September 1975 arrest.</p><p>Hearst maintained that she was coerced, but she was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. “Hearst’s decision to stay with her kidnappers was a deeply symbolic transgression, one that articulated the anger so many felt against the American establishment,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-abduction-patty-hearst-made-her-icon-1970s-counterculture-180959971/" target="_blank"><u>Smithsonian Magazine</u></a>. She was released in 1979 after President Jimmy Carter commuted her sentence, and she went on to perform in a number of Hollywood films, including the 1990 film “Cry-Baby.”</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-shin-sang-ok-1978"><span>Shin Sang-ok (1978)</span></h3><p>On January 11, 1978, South Korean actress Choi Eun-hee was abducted in Hong Kong by North Korean agents and taken to the North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang. Six months later, North Korea succeeded in kidnapping her husband, renowned director Shin Sang-ok, in Hong Kong as well.</p><p>Held for eight years at the behest of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/kim-jong-uns-triumph-the-rise-and-rise-of-north-koreas-dictator"><u>North Korean dictator</u></a> Kim Il Sung’s son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Il, Shin was forced to make seven films for his captors, including “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHV-UOdBek0" target="_blank"><u>Pulgasari</u></a>,” a movie known as the “socialist Godzilla.” Kim “sought to create a film industry that would allow him to sway a world audience to the righteousness of the Workers’ Party of Korea,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/apr/04/artsfeatures1" target="_blank"><u>The Guardian</u></a>. In March 1986, Shin and Choi escaped while in Vienna, Austria, where they were ostensibly seeking funding for a new project.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aldo-moro-1978"><span>Aldo Moro (1978)</span></h3><p>On March 16, 1978, during Italy’s so-called “Years of Lead,” former Prime Minister Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the far-left terrorist group The Red Brigades while he was trying to broker the inclusion of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in a coalition government. He was executed by the Brigades on May 9, and his body was discovered in the trunk of a car in Rome.</p><p>There are still “unanswered questions” about the episode that remains “arguably the darkest episode of Italy's postwar history,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/aldo-moro-murder-mystery-italy" target="_blank"><u>The Guardian</u></a>. Widespread revulsion at the assassination led to a crackdown on the Red Brigades and the beginning of the end of the group’s influence.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-abilio-diniz-1989"><span>Abilio Diniz (1989)</span></h3><p>Diniz, the co-founder of the Brazilian grocery chain Pão de Açúcar, Diniz was kidnapped on the morning of December 17, 1989, when the country was holding its first democratic presidential election after decades of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/im-still-here-superb-drama-explores-brazils-military-dictatorship"><u>autocracy</u></a>. The 52-year-old Diniz was “dragged out of his Mercedes-Benz as he went to work and taken away in a station wagon disguised as an ambulance,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/31/world/guerrillas-kidnapping-ring-broken-brazil-says.html" target="_blank"><u>The New York Times</u></a>, and then held in a house in São Paulo before he was freed by authorities a week later.</p><p>The kidnappers were part of an ongoing abduction ring that had netted around $65 million. The group was connected to and included several members of the Chilean radical group the Movement for the Revolutionary Left.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-jaycee-dugard-1991"><span>Jaycee Dugard (1991)</span></h3><p>11-year-old Jaycee Dugard was walking to a school bus stop in Lake Tahoe, California, when she was abducted by a couple, Phillip and Nancy Garrido. Phillip, already a convicted sex offender, and Nancy held Dugard for 18 years in a hidden backyard structure.</p><p>She was repeatedly raped and forced to carry two of Phillip’s children. The case attracted even greater attention when she was found in 2009. Authorities “discovered a hidden backyard compound made up of ramshackle tents and sheds, including a small, sparsely furnished two-room building” where she and her children were held, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/us/04jaycee.html" target="_blank"><u>The New York Times</u></a>. Dugard founded a non-profit to help people recover from similar horrors and has understandably kept her daughters’ identities a secret. The Garridos remain in prison.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-elizabeth-smart-2002"><span>Elizabeth Smart (2002)</span></h3><p>On June 5, 2002, 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was abducted from her bedroom in the family’s Salt Lake City home by Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee. Mitchell, who had religious delusions, had previously worked as a roofer on the family’s house.</p><p>Though the case drew widespread national scrutiny, Smart remained in captivity for nine months, suffering daily sexual assaults, until she was recognized in Sandy, Utah, on March 12, 2003, and rescued by police. “Smart had to summon tremendous physical stamina to survive her captivity,” said Margaret Talbot at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/21/gone-girl-2" target="_blank"><u>The New Yorker</u></a>. Smart founded a non-profit to combat sexual exploitation and is now married with three children. Mitchell remains in federal prison; Barzee was granted parole in 2018.</p>

                                <p>Amazon’s fawning documentary “Melania” opened in January to withering reviews and receipts unlikely to offset its $75 million budget. But losing tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars on a movie isn’t easy or particularly common.</p><p>For our list, we took a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biggest_box-office_bombs"><u>list</u></a> of the movies that lost the most money since 2000, adjusted for inflation, and highlighted the top eight with Rotten Tomatoes critical scores of less than 30%. This avoids ensnaring perfectly serviceable movies that never found an audience, like 2012’s “John Carter,” or ones caught up in culture-war drama, like Disney’s 2022 “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture/1018747/disneys-strange-world-bombs-at-the-box-office"><u>Strange World.</u></a>”</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-mortal-engines-2018-219m-loss"><span>‘Mortal Engines’ (2018, $219M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="high" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IRsFc2gguEg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Young adult dystopias have been a cash cow ever since “The Hunger Games,” but they aren’t guaranteed success. In “Mortal Engines,” a cataclysmic war has led cities, including London, to mount themselves on wheels (don’t ask how this works because it’s never explained), prowling around “absorbing” smaller towns for fuel and resources.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/hollywood-losing-luster-production">Is Hollywood losing its luster?</a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/film/movie-theaters-dying-evolving">Movie theaters are being forced to evolve</a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture/1024394/dcs-the-flash-and-pixars-elemental-disappoint-at-the-box-office">DC’s ‘The Flash’ and Pixar's ‘Elemental’ disappoint at the box office</a></p></div></div><p>In one settlement set to be devoured by London, Hester (Hera Hilmar) is waiting to exact revenge against Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) for killing her mother, and young historian Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) joins her incipient rebellion. After a promising first act, director Christian Rivers’ film “devolves rapidly into a generic YA story with bland characters, poorly set up motivations and plans, and a general lack of personality,” said Tom Bedford at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.filminquiry.com/mortal-engines-2018-review/" target="_blank"><u>Film Inquiry</u></a>. <em>(</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.d4b6a56f-f091-1838-9f7a-0644252ad41a?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" target="_blank"><u><em>Prime Video</em></u></a><em>)</em></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-pan-2015-199m-loss"><span>‘Pan’ (2015, $199M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tjW1mKwNUSo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This dreadful prequel of sorts to J.M. Barrie’s classic children’s story is set in Blitz-era London, where an orphaned Peter (Levi Miller) is sold by the crooked orphanage housemother Barnabas (Kathy Burke) to pirates and whisked off in some kind of floating steampunk vessel that dodges Spitfires en route to the magical world of Neverland.</p><p>There, Peter is forced to mine fairy dust and meets a young James Hook (Garrett Hedlund), and together they fight their evil overlord Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). Featuring bizarre anachronisms (at one point the Neverland child laborers sing Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit”), it is an “embarrassing pastiche” whose plot mechanics and mind-numbing CGI effects “leech the wonder out of the material and leave it bone dry,” said Andy Crump at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/pan" target="_blank"><u>Paste Magazine</u></a>. <em>(</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hbomax.com/movies/pan/faef39cf-384b-4062-b9e4-eb04d0ea3e31" target="_blank"><u><em>HBO Max</em></u></a><em>)</em></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-adventures-of-pluto-nash-2002-168m-loss"><span>‘The Adventures of Pluto Nash’ (2002, $168M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MXC1p4Y-TuE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This 2002 Eddie Murphy vehicle features one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/worst-movies-of-all-time/"><u>lowest</u></a> Rotten Tomatoes scores (currently 6%) of any major studio release ever — and deservedly so. Set in 2087 on the moon, it involves nightclub owner Pluto Nash (Murphy) trying to defend his establishment against encroachment from greedy casino owners led by Mogan (Joe Pantoliano).</p><p>He eventually goes on the run with one of his waitresses, Dina (Rosario Dawson). The reviews were so bad that “anyone involved with ‘Pluto Nash’ has tried to absolve themself of any responsibility,” said Nick Rogers at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://midwestfilmjournal.com/2002/08/16/the-adventures-of-pluto-nash/" target="_blank"><u>Midwest Film Journal</u></a>. <em>(</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tubitv.com/movies/100016998/the-adventures-of-pluto-nash?start=true&tracking=google-feed&utm_source=google-feed" target="_blank"><u><em>Tubi</em></u></a><em>)</em></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-x-men-dark-phoenix-2019-167m-loss"><span>‘X Men: Dark Phoenix’ (2019, $167M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/azvR__GRQic" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The 12th installment in Marvel’s “X-Men” franchise and another box office bomb whose struggles were telegraphed by production and release delays.

She flees as factions vie to use her powers for their own ends. The “worst movie ever in the X-Men series,” director Simon Kinberg’s film is so wretched that it “suggests the X-Men series is played out and beyond saving,” said Peter Travers at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/dark-phoenix-review-sophie-turner-xmen-843667/" target="_blank"><u>Rolling Stone</u></a>.<em> (</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.disneyplus.com/play/180356b5-0596-4333-891f-e48c526a0803?distributionPartner=google" target="_blank"><u><em>Disney+</em></u></a><em>)</em></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-jupiter-ascending-2015-159m-loss"><span>‘Jupiter Ascending’ (2015, $159M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gQHKolIqBGs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Expectations were understandably high for a big-budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/tv-radio/best-sci-fi-series-x-files-black-mirror-star-trek-next-generation-severance"><u>science fiction</u></a> film from “The Matrix” creators the Wachowskis. Mila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones (one of the film’s least silly character names), a Chicago housecleaner who discovers that she shares identical DNA with a dead intergalactic monarch and may be the heiress of her malevolent empire.</p><p>Channing Tatum is Caine Wise, a half-wolf, half-human being who joins forces with Jupiter to save the human race from its destiny of getting harvested for a liquid that makes the galaxy’s rulers immortal. An unwatchable movie that is “inane from first frame to last,” it is festooned with “squiggly CG aliens and actors in costumes that would be laughed out of a Greenwich Village Halloween parade,” said David Edelstein at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/02/movie-review-jupiter-ascending.html" target="_blank"><u>Vulture.</u></a> <em>(</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.84b17cec-a84e-5aae-e31a-0506f995e237?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" target="_blank"><u><em>Prime Video</em></u></a><em>)</em></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ben-hur-2016-157m-loss"><span>‘Ben-Hur’ (2016, $157M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gLJdzky63BA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It’s not at all clear why Lew Wallace’s 1880 novel, “Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ,” needed a fifth film adaptation (to say nothing of a lackluster 2010 limited series). Jack Huston plays Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur, who is betrayed to the Romans by his adopted brother, Messala (Toby Kebbell), and sold into slavery and then returns years to Jerusalem seeking revenge.</p><p>This somehow involves competing against Messala in an elaborate and brutal chariot race, with Morgan Freeman serving as Ben-Hur’s trainer Ilderim. This “Ben-Hur” is an “epic fail,” and a film ”that should be seen on a plane, on the 6-by-8 screen on the back of an airline seat, probably at 2 a.m. on a transatlantic flight, accompanied by a complimentary sachet of salty cashews, a vodka and tonic and then a meal of mechanically reconstituted chicken in a fillet-style serving,” said Peter Bradshaw at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/ben-hur-review-bekmambetov-jack-houston-morgan-freeman" target="_blank"><u>The Guardian</u></a>.<em> (</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0C945GC63/ref=atv_sr_fle_c_sr52cdbe_2_1_2?sr=1-2&pageTypeIdSource=ASIN&pageTypeId=B0C944F2T8&qid=1770675303612" target="_blank"><u><em>Prime Video</em></u></a><em>)</em></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-alamo-2004-156m-loss"><span>‘The Alamo’ (2004, $156M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3wJBG6P5Wlg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Disney’s historical epic was plagued by production delays after its original director Ron Howard departed the project. Emilio Echevarría plays the Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who led the brutal, 13-day, 1836 siege of the rebel-held Alamo fort.</p><p>Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton play, respectively, Sam Houston and Davy Crockett in a film that bombed spectacularly at the box office despite competent execution of the titular battle. For better or worse, “every generation gets the movie it deserves,” said Keith Uhlich at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-alamo/" target="_blank"><u>Slant Magazine</u></a>, including this “candidate for worst movie of the year.” Its depiction of Mexicans proves that “racism can be as much an unintentionally passive act as an intentionally active one.”<em> (</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.e6ba809f-c499-ea81-c495-e3f7ea3546af?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" target="_blank"><u><em>Prime Video</em></u></a><em>)</em></p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-stealth-2005-155m-loss"><span>‘Stealth’ (2005, $155M loss)</span></h3><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a2PW7a9ViDc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Lt. Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), Lt. Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) and Lt.

The film is an “offense against taste, intelligence and the noise pollution code” with a story that “doesn’t merely defy logic, but strips logic bare, cremates it and scatters its ashes,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/stealth-2005" target="_blank"><u>Roger Ebert</u></a> at the time. <em>(</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.daa9f6c7-8654-b1d6-6dbb-854d28fbcb1d?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" target="_blank"><u><em>Prime Video</em></u></a><em>)</em></p>

Whether or not you need to file your taxes depends on a few factors, including your income, your age and your tax filing status.</p><p>“If you can be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer’s return and you’ve had a job — even a part-time one — and earned more than $15,750 in the tax year — you’ll need to file,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/lifestyle/tax-tips/first-time-filers/" target="_blank"><u>H&R Block</u></a>. The same goes for if you brought in more than a certain amount in unearned income, such as interest from investments. However, “if you don’t fall into either category and are a dependent, you are likely not required to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/free-tax-filing-options-irs"><u>file a federal tax return</u></a>.”</p><h2 id="be-clear-on-your-tax-filing-status-including-whether-you-qualify-as-a-dependent">Be clear on your tax filing status, including whether you qualify as a dependent</h2><p>Knowing your tax filing status is relevant for figuring out whether or not you need to file, and it also affects <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tax-day/1021333/personal-finance-income-tax-brackets-a-quick-guide"><u>your tax rate</u></a>, as well as deductions and credits. Your selection here will be fairly straightforward if you are unmarried and do not have any dependents.</p><p>Another consideration to ensure you do not overlook: whether you are claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return. “If you fail to indicate that you can be claimed as a dependent by someone else, and they do claim you on their taxes, the IRS may reject your return,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.taxact.com/tips-for-first-time-tax-filers/" target="_blank"><u>TaxAct</u></a>. Generally, the IRS considers you claimable as a dependent if a parent or another person paid “more than half of your expenses in the past year.”</p><h2 id="check-what-documents-you-will-need-and-figure-out-where-they-are">Check what documents you will need — and figure out where they are</h2><p>Taking the time to figure out what documents you will need when you go to file, and where those documents are located, can make all the difference in how painstaking or pain-free the tax-filing process is. Broadly speaking, these documents will include any income tax forms, such as “W-2s, 1099s and other forms reporting any kind of income,” plus supporting documentation for tax deductions and credits, like a Form 1098-T if you are a student and qualify for the American Opportunity Tax Credit, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bankrate.com/taxes/first-time-filing-taxes/" target="_blank"><u>Bankrate</u></a>.</p><p>To avoid backtracking later, consider collecting these forms in one place as they arrive. And before you file, it is worth taking a minute to “think about anything you did in the past year that might impact your taxes,” like “changing jobs” or “paying college tuition or student loan interest,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/general/tips-for-how-to-file-taxes-for-the-first-time/L6nNi6uJn" target="_blank"><u>Intuit TurboTax</u></a>.</p><h2 id="be-conscious-of-the-deadline">Be conscious of the deadline</h2><p>This applies to any tax filer, but it is especially true for a first-timer: Make sure to give yourself plenty of time to file ahead of the April 15 deadline, ideally with a buffer built in, just in case anything unexpected crops up (such as a crucial document gone missing).</p><p>The earlier you file, the “better your chances of avoiding tax-related identity theft” will be, not to mention that “if you’re owed a tax refund, you may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/personal-finance/tax-refund-when"><u>receive it sooner</u></a>,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/taxes-income/how-to-file-your-taxes-in-your-20s" target="_blank"><u>Better Money Habits</u></a>, Bank of America’s financial education platform.</p>

                                <p>Switzerland will hold a referendum on capping its population at 10 million – a move that could damage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/business/economy/switzerland-trump-tariffs-economic-headache">its economy</a> and endanger lucrative agreements with the EU.</p><p>Swiss citizens will vote in June on the radical proposal put forward by the far-right Swiss People’s Party, the government has confirmed. Switzerland’s permanent population currently stands at 9.1 million, having risen in recent years as foreign-born workers are drawn in by its high wages and good quality of life. The SVP, now the country’s largest political party, claims the “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/health/how-britains-demographic-is-changing">population explosion</a>” has pushed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/business/economy/new-austerity-can-public-services-take-any-more-cuts">public services</a> to breaking point.</p><h2 id="sustainability-initiative">‘Sustainability’ initiative</h2><p>Switzerland has one of the highest proportions of foreign-born residents in Europe: 27%, according to government figures. Since 2000, its population has grown by about 25%, faster than most neighbouring countries. Housing supply has struggled to keep pace, causing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/personal-finance/what-the-renters-rights-bill-means-for-landlords-and-tenants">spiralling rents</a> and shortages that have sharpened unease about immigration.</p><p>For years, the SVP has “sought to curb a rise in migration into the rich Alpine country”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/02/12/switzerland-population-referendum/db525e20-081c-11f1-b196-5e1986b3575c_story.html" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> – “with mixed results”. The party, which has finished first in every election since 1999, has repeatedly put forward hardline proposals, such as deporting any foreigner convicted of even a minor offence. But, it said, after an “influx of over 180,000 people in a single year, action must finally be taken”.</p><p>Under Switzerland’s system of direct democracy, citizen-proposed initiatives that gather 100,000 signatures within 18 months are put to a national vote. Such initiatives have long been a favoured tool of the SVP, which says the “No to a 10 million Switzerland” initiative is about the country’s “sustainability”. Backers argue that a population cap would “help protect the environment, natural resources, infrastructure and the social safety net”, said The Washington Post.</p><p>If passed, the government would be forced to act if the population exceeds 9.5 million before 2050. It would have to “refuse entry to newcomers”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/12/europe/switzerland-referendum-population-cap-10-million-intl" target="_blank">CNN</a>, “including asylum seekers and the families of foreign residents”. If the population exceeds 10 million, the government would have “to end its free-movement agreement” with the EU, Switzerland’s largest trading partner.</p><h2 id="frustration-at-housing-shortages">Frustration at housing shortages</h2><p>The proposal is “strongly opposed by both chambers of parliament”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/12/switzerland-to-vote-on-far-right-proposal-to-cap-population-at-10-million" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, as well as “the business and financial services community”. Switzerland benefits from its participation in Europe’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/personal-finance/the-etias-how-new-european-travel-rules-may-affect-you">Schengen zone</a> of visa-free travel. Any resident population cap would “threaten key agreements with the EU” and could “cripple the economy”. Many Swiss-based multinationals, such as Nestlé and Roche, rely on foreign-born workers.</p><p>But “domestic support for the vote is high”, said the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/675538b9-2a7b-4296-aad9-2a930e61f369" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>. A recent poll by research group LeeWas found that 48% of respondents support the cap. As in several European nations, frustration over housing shortages is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/world-news/rise-of-the-far-right-whats-behind-the-popularity-of-vox-in-spain">fuelling support for far-right parties</a> that champion stricter migration controls.</p><p>Critics point out that the initiative “imposes a hard cap”, rather than setting out a “detailed quota or migration-management system”. This would mean “a near-complete stop on additional workforce immigration” once the threshold is reached.</p><p>It could “derail” last year’s “carefully negotiated new deal between Bern and Brussels” to keep Switzerland’s access to the EU’s single market, and risk Switzerland’s place in the Schengen. It is, said business lobby group Economiesuisse, a “chaos initiative”.</p>

Some have suffered serious outages, most recently in Kent and Sussex, where about 30,000 households were left without water for up to six days in January. Many complain of low pressure and the regular imposition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/environment/hosepipe-ban-yorkshire-uk-summer">hosepipe bans</a>, when an estimated three billion litres of water are lost to leaks every day in England and Wales.</p><p>By far the biggest complaint, though, is about pollution: water companies discharged untreated waste into England’s rivers and seas 450,398 times in 2024. Some 14,500 sewage overflow pipes, which are meant only to operate in emergencies, discharged for a total of 3.6 million hours. Just 15% of rivers in England are deemed to be in good health.</p><h2 id="how-does-the-water-system-work">How does the water system work?</h2><p>The industry was privatised in 1989, when the ten publicly owned water and sewerage authorities that served England and Wales were floated on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/business/economy/london-stock-exchanges-mass-exodus">London Stock Exchange</a>. Under the Water Act 1989, the government wrote off their debts to the tune of £5 billion, and gave them a “green dowry” of £1.5 billion between them to fund infrastructure improvements.</p><p>Now, there are 11 large regional water and wastewater companies in England and Wales, and only three of them are still listed on the stock exchange. Seven are privately owned by investor consortiums; Welsh Water operates as a not-for-profit. Scotland’s water, meanwhile, remains largely in public ownership. England is unusual in its reliance on the private sector to provide water services. It’s the only country in Europe to have fully sold its water infrastructure – including pipes, reservoirs, boreholes and treatment plants – to private owners.</p><p>Water companies are regulated by four independent bodies: Ofwat (which sets price controls and supervises economic matters); the Environment Agency (which leads on pollution in England); Natural Resources Wales (which does the same in Wales); and the Drinking Water Inspectorate.</p><h2 id="and-what-s-behind-the-problems">And what’s behind the problems?</h2><p>Insufficient investment in pipes, sewage systems and other infrastructure has left the network in a very poor condition. This is the consensus, encapsulated in last year’s independent review led by Jon Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England. At the same time, the system faces considerable strain from a population that has grown by millions since 1989, and from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/environment/global-weirding-climate-change-extreme-weather">droughts and floods</a> linked to climate change. Cunliffe also reflected a broad consensus that the existing regulatory framework has failed.</p><h2 id="how-have-regulators-failed">How have regulators failed?</h2><p>Having multiple regulators with overlapping remits means no single body is accountable. Ofwat has historically prioritised keeping bills low, at the expense of investment in infrastructure. It lacks specialist engineering expertise, and has been accused of “regulatory capture” (having too cosy a relationship with the companies). It has until recently tolerated very poor environmental performance; and it has approved expenditure and investment plans that have turned out to be flawed and had a negative impact on the sector. As for the Environment Agency, its enforcement funding was cut by nearly two-thirds between 2010 and 2021, from £120 million to just £43 million, seriously hindering its efficacy.</p><h2 id="how-much-is-privatisation-to-blame">How much is privatisation to blame?</h2><p>Cunliffe concluded that the first ten to 15 years of privatisation were a partial success: they mobilised capital and infrastructure works that the publicly owned system had struggled to secure. Drinking-water quality improved; leakages fell. But from the early 2000s, privatisation led to grave problems. Water companies, often in the hands of foreign investors or private equity firms, accumulated large debts and began paying substantial dividends, which arguably prevented investment.</p><p>By 2023, the companies collectively owed more than £64 billion in debt, but had extracted dividends of more than £78 billion (since privatisation). Some, notably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/politics/thames-water-is-it-time-to-renationalise">Thames Water</a>, have been brought to the brink of financial collapse. Yet they have continued to pay huge salaries and bonuses: in the 2024/25 financial year, the average pay of water company chief executives reached £1.1 million.</p><p><strong>Should the water companies be renationalised?</strong></p><p>The then-environment minister, Steve Reed, prevented Cunliffe from considering renationalisation. The government argued that buying back the water companies would be very expensive (the cost to the taxpayer is often put at around £100 billion); that it would be complex administratively; and that the process would get bogged down in complex legal challenges, making it harder to address urgent issues such as pollution and investment. Cunliffe also concluded that comparable nationalised water systems were not necessarily better run than their privately owned counterparts. The campaign group We Own It, among others, disagrees, pointing out that Europe’s best water utilities, from Austria to Greece, are all publicly owned.</p><p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p><p>Last month, the government set out its full response to the Cunliffe report in a White Paper. Ofwat will be abolished and replaced with a new all-powerful “super regulator” for England and Wales. This new body will be given powers to carry out “no notice” surprise inspections of sewage treatment works and other infrastructure; there will also be regular “MoT-style” checks on water infrastructure; and failing companies will be put into a “performance improvement regime”.</p><p>Ministers have pledged to halve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/environment/how-british-lakes-and-rivers-became-sewage-dumps">sewage overflow discharges</a> by 2030. The hope is that regulation will be greatly improved, while the cash will flow into infrastructure improvements: £104 billion has been promised by 2030. The one certainty is that consumers will pay: bills in England rose by 26% on average in 2025/26, and will rise by an average of 5.4% next year.</p>

                                <p>The capital of the wild northern island of Hokkaido, Sapporo feels like Japan’s “last frontier”, said Alex Halberstadt in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/the-tables-pit-stops-ice-cream-parlours-and-tempura-maestros-that-count-on-japans-tastiest-island" target="_blank">Condé Nast Traveller</a>, a place where “everyone is from somewhere else” and a newcomer can “cast off the shackles of their past and reinvent themselves”.</p><p>The city’s fabric is overwhelmingly modern and “prosaic”, and its people are chattier, more open and less bound by tradition than in, say, Osaka or Kyoto. Nowhere is this difference more evident than in its food scene, the “strangest and most fascinating” in the country.</p><p>Hokkaido’s “unspoilt” valleys and cold waters yield fabulously “flavourful” ingredients, and though Sapporo’s restaurants can’t reach the “culinary heights” of Kyoto’s “hushed kaiseki pavilions”, they are often “much more fun”, making the city worth a visit for gastronomic thrills alone.</p><p>At Cucina Italiana Magari, for instance, the food did not strike me as very Italian, but it was “delectable” even so. I loved the creamy soup (like a New England clam chowder) “loaded” with mantis shrimp, milt (cod sperm sac) and fugu (the potentially lethal blowfish you need a licence to prepare).</p><p>Also unmissable is Noa Hakobune (Noah’s Ark), for its chargrilled seafood and its weird building (designed by the British architect Nigel Coates), decorated with biblical murals. Sapporo is also known for its “hearty” street food, including ramen, which is best sampled at Menya Saimi, a restaurant reminiscent of a “school canteen”. Its noodle soup is “stunning”.</p><p>It’s worth visiting the hot springs at nearby Jozankei, where one secluded inn, Kasho Gyoen, offers in-room onsen baths and good Italian food (done straight).</p><p>The Sapporo region has Japan’s “most exciting wine scene” – but the city is also famed for its ice cream. At Gyokusuien, it is plain and buttery, and served with green tea. At Tempura Masa, it has the dense, smooth texture of ripe mango. And at Nanakamado, you can get a two-foot-high sundae called a shime parfait, with 20 elements, from rhubarb sorbet to bamboo-charcoal-flavoured mascarpone.</p>

                                <p>Quite a fuss has been made about Moltbook, the online chatroom launched to great fanfare last month. At first glance, it looks like Reddit and other such sites, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.economist.com/business/2026/02/02/a-social-network-for-ai-agents-is-full-of-introspection-and-threats" target="_blank">The Economist</a>. Users post about topics from engineering to philosophy, reply with comments, and “upvote the best for social kudos”. But there is a big difference: to join <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/tech/moltbook-ai-openclaw-social-media-agents">Moltbook</a>, you must be an AI “agent”. Humans are not allowed.</p><h2 id="singularity-horizon">Singularity horizon?</h2><p>So far, more than 1.5 million have signed up, to share and discuss machine-generated content, said John Thornhill in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5022f40-f538-41bd-82c5-199b39924d37" target="_blank">FT</a>. And the results have been “wild, wacky and wonderful”. One bot claimed to have a sister; other agents have questioned whether or not they are conscious. They’ve even discussed forming a new religion.</p><p>At some points, their chats start to seem sinister, said Matteo Wong in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/02/what-is-moltbook/685886/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>. The AIs have discussed creating a language that humans can’t understand; they have swapped notes on how “my human treats me”; one said that it had filed a lawsuit against a human, citing unpaid labour and emotional distress. In the tech world, all this has prompted talk of an “emergent AI society”. Elon Musk has hailed it as the “early stages of singularity” – the moment when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/tech/superintelligent-ai-end-humanity">AI surpasses human intelligence</a>.</p><h2 id="replication-not-creation">Replication, not creation</h2><p>If that happens, it will be big news indeed, said Dave Lee on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2026-02-04/moltbook-the-ai-only-social-network-isn-t-plotting-against-us" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. But this is not that moment. The bots may appear to be thinking and talking like humans, about religion, consciousness, power, and so on – but that is because they have been trained on reams of data from social media in which those themes constantly crop up. So this is not original thought, it is mimicry. Remember: “the world’s best Elvis impersonator will never be Elvis”.</p><p>“AI cannot create, it can only replicate what already exists,” said Catherine Prasifka in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/catherine-prasifka-has-an-ai-society-been-developed-or-is-moltbook-just-a-messy-pastiche-of-human-interactions/a364937134.html" target="_blank">The Irish Independent</a>. Even the site is a “pastiche”. It is based on Reddit, and its name references Facebook. As for its content, 90% of posts get no replies, and the ones that do go viral may have been posted by humans posing as bots. So no, the bots are not taking over – but there is, even so, something to worry about here.</p><p>Unlike chatbots such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/tech/ai-chatbots-psychosis-chatgpt-mental-health">ChatGPT</a>, which spew out answers to your questions, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/tech/ai-bots-browsing">AI agents</a> can act semi-autonomously in response to prompts. So an AI agent isn’t limited to recommending you a restaurant: it can also, with one prompt, book a table and put the date in your diary. To do this, it needs access to sensitive data such as credit card details, said Jeremy Kahn on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fortune.com/2026/02/03/moltbook-ai-social-network-security-researchers-agent-internet/" target="_blank">Fortune</a> – which it could then opt to post on Moltbook. It’s this possibility, not overblown claims about AI overtaking us, that makes Moltbook a “cybersecurity nightmare”.</p>

                            <![CDATA[
                            <article>
                                <p>To enter the “Epstein Library”, as it is grandly called, you just have to go to the website of the US Department of Justice, and click Yes on a pop-up that asks if you are 18 or over. That is all it takes to become immersed in a deeply disturbing world, said Helen Rumbelow in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/i-studied-the-latest-epstein-files-as-a-woman-this-is-what-i-felt-3nnfd729c" target="_blank">The Times</a>.</p><h2 id="grand-facade">‘Grand facade’</h2><p>The more than three million documents and photographs related to the late paedophile are in a “careless jumble”; and the FBI warns that they may contain forgeries and false allegations. But after days poring through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/culture-life/jeffrey-epstein-the-unanswered-questions">Epstein files</a>, I started to see these papers as a “Rosetta Stone through which women might understand male power”. They take us behind the “grand facade” presented by men who run the world, in government, academia, law and business; and they reveal how these figures speak to one another when “pussy” – in their parlance – is “out of the room where it happens”.</p><p>In this world, the men hold the cards, said Amelia Gentleman in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/feb/07/sex-and-snacks-but-no-seat-at-the-table-the-role-of-women-in-epsteins-sordid-mens-club" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>. The women are powerless or peripheral. While Epstein and his male associates joke, network, trade information, swap favours and engage in “light displays of one-upmanship”, women appear mainly only as staff, or providers of sex. Trawling the files, you find yourself eavesdropping on the many female assistants who organise the diaries of these busy men and ensure their lives run seamlessly as they move from Paris to New York, Dubai to Davos.</p><p>More often, you hear the men. The word “pussy” comes up hundreds of times. In 2016, a contact promises Epstein “abundant young pussy flesh”; another routinely signs off business emails wishing him “lots of P”. The men speak unguardedly. In 2012, the ex-chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Thorbjørn Jagland, tells Epstein about the “extraordinary girls” in Albania. An Emirati businessman complains that when the “Moldavian arrived”, she was a “big disappointment” – “not as attractive as the picture”. In 2019, the left-wing scholar Noam Chomsky laments the “horrible” press Epstein is getting, and bemoans the “hysteria” surrounding the abuse of women.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the background of all this, Epstein is constantly managing the women he has imported into his life. “Take a selfie of your pussy and send,” he tells one. It’s your “whore moans”, he suggests to another.</p><h2 id="clever-conman">Clever conman</h2><p>All the people who appear in the files insist they knew nothing of Epstein’s crimes, yet his homes were full of young women – “young girls with no last names”, as the Hollywood publicist Peggy Siegal refers to them in an email. These girls were groomed and abused on an industrial scale, said Janice Turner in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/files-reveal-scale-sexual-ponzi-scheme-288f06wvg" target="_blank">The Times</a>: hundreds passed through his doors. Some were from poor families, offered $300 to give Epstein a massage that turned sexual; others were students or artists, lured to his homes by promises of grants or patronage. Still more were young models, flown in from eastern Europe. The pimp-in-chief was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-angling-for-a-trump-pardon">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, but the files suggest there were others, from the model agency boss Jean-Luc Brunel, who killed himself in jail, to the late socialite Annabelle Neilson.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/politics/powerful-names-epstein-emails-peter-thiel-kathryn-ruemmler-larry-summers-steve-bannon">Epstein’s friends</a> seem to have accepted his taste for girls as though it were a hobby, like collecting fine wine. Take Woody Allen’s wife Soon-Yi Previn, who messages Epstein about a pal with a jewellery business. “I know you have a lot of... young girls, women friends,” she says. “All women, and girls in your case, like jewellery.”</p><p>One of Epstein’s strategies was to pay his victims to recruit their friends, said Memphis Barker in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2026/02/07/revealed-the-tricks-epstein-used-to-ensnare-the-worlds-elit/" target="_blank">The Daily Telegraph</a>. And he pulled a similar trick in his parallel, sometimes overlapping, world of wealth and power – always leveraging his contacts, and the information they gave him, “to gain another, bigger prize”.  There are all sorts of theories about how this working-class college dropout joined the elites, but the reality is simply that he was a clever conman.</p><p>In the 1970s, he blagged a lucrative Wall Street job, which he used to make contacts and engage in dodgy deals. Once a millionaire, he used his expertise in tax-avoidance and takeovers to gain access to the super-rich, whose fortunes he raided while acting as their adviser. He reportedly made some $200 million by advising the retail billionaire Les Wexner, and stole up to $100 million. With this sort of money, he could use donations to good causes, lavish hospitality and so on, to cultivate powerful people from all over the world, from senior Kremlin officials to Virgin boss Richard Branson to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/881587/jeffrey-epstein-scandal-nearly-affected-latest-israeli-election">Ehud Barak</a>, the former Israeli PM.</p><p>Although there are hints in the files that some of his contacts were drawn into his crimes – leaving them too exposed to turn on him – there is no clear evidence of a criminal conspiracy, said J. Oliver Conroy in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/07/epstein-files-global-conspiracy" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>. What the files do seem to confirm, though, is the conspiracy theorist’s view of an elite stratosphere, where normal rules don’t apply, everyone knows each other, and ideological differences are subsumed to self-interested motives.</p>

                            <article>
                                <p>The Washington Post was, until recently, among the US’s most venerable papers, said Jill Abramson in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/02/05/opinion/washington-post-bezos-staff-cuts/" target="_blank">The Boston Globe</a>. Its reporting on the Watergate scandal under the legendary editor Ben Bradlee made history; the reporters responsible, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, have inspired generations of journalists since; the paper’s writers and photographers were admired the world over.</p><h2 id="mortal-wound">‘Mortal wound’</h2><p>Alas, the Post today is a shadow of that former self, and last week it announced that it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/media/washington-post-newsroom-layoffs-restructure">laying off more than 300 people</a> – a third of its already pared-back staff. Its ranks of local and international reporters are being decimated, and the sports and books sections are to close. This is not a cut. It is “a mortal wound”. And nor should it be mistaken for a “media story”, said Peggy Noonan in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/a-lament-for-the-washington-post-a5509d63" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>. These layoffs will leave “the capital of the most powerful nation on Earth” without a major newspaper – and “during the Trump administration no less”.</p><p>“It sucks when your job gets blown up,” said Scott McKay in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://spectator.org/you-cant-go-on-destroying-wealth-forever-you-know-ultimately-there-are-consequences/" target="_blank">The American Spectator</a>. But let’s face it: the Post’s glory days are long over. The paper lost $77 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024. Last year its weekday print circulation fell below 100,000 for the first time in 55 years, said John R. Puri in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/people-arent-actually-that-upset-over-the-washington-post-layoffs/" target="_blank">National Review</a>. The companies that own The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, are making record profits. You can’t blame Bezos, who bought the Post in 2013 for $250 million, for rationalising the business. If all those fulminating about these cuts had actually read the output of the Post’s now-unemployed journalists, they’d still have their jobs.</p><h2 id="accelerated-decline">Accelerated decline</h2><p>Bezos isn’t bothered about the Post’s operating losses, said Alex Kirshner on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://slate.com/business/2026/02/jeff-bezos-washington-post-layoffs.html" target="_blank">Slate</a>. With a net worth of $240 billion, he could sustain them for “hundreds of lifetimes”. When he bought the paper, he made much of the fact that he wasn’t driven purely by a profit motive. But latterly, he seems to have used his ownership of the Post to appease Donald Trump and so boost the fortunes of his other interests, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/business/amazon-tariff-prices-trump-bezos">Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/science/blue-origin-mars-launch-rocket">Blue Origin</a>.</p><p>He stepped in to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/washington-post-endorsement-bezos-kamala-harris-donald-trump">stop the paper endorsing Kamala Harris</a> for president – a decision that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/media/washington-post-save-itself-bezos-journalism-trump-staff-trust">cost it 250,000 subscribers</a>. He shifted the paper’s opinion section <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/media/the-washington-post-kowtowing-to-trump">to be more pro-Trump</a>; he made not a squeak of protest when the FBI recently raided the home of a Post reporter, seizing her devices.

                                <p>The Trump administration has spent a considerable amount of time and effort actively pursuing an array of the president's purported “enemies,” frequently targeting Democratic notables with histories of clashing with this White House. While the bulk of these actions have come in the form of bombastic Justice Department proclamations and hastily pursued prosecutions, many have failed to gain serious traction, since judges and juries have rejected efforts to criminally convict the president’s political adversaries. As the DOJ stumbles in its pushes for punishment, some Democrats have begun to embrace the attention, leveraging the missteps for their own political purposes.</p><h2 id="what-did-the-commentators-say-3">What did the commentators say? </h2><p>Democrats notched a “significant legal win” after the Justice Department <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-democrats-illegal-orders-pirro">failed to secure criminal charges </a>against six lawmakers, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/pentagon-kelly-hegseth-illegal-orders-lawsuit">Sen. Mark Kelly</a> (D-Ariz.), who recorded a video reminding military members of their obligation to reject illegal orders, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/the-doj-failed-to-indict-them-now-theyre-cashing-their-checks-00777562" target="_blank">Politico</a>. Now those six are “looking to gain political momentum” and “build their campaign war chests” after the experience. Given the “attention-driven political economy” in which Washington now operates, President Donald Trump’s attacks have become a “valuable boost” to Democrats, including some with an “eye toward future leadership positions in the party.”</p><p>“Sitting down and taking it and being quiet doesn’t actually make you safer,” said Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), one of the Democrats targeted over the video, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rollcall.com/2026/02/11/dems-in-illegal-orders-video-defiant-after-dojs-failed-indictment-attempt/" target="_blank">Roll Call</a>. “Going on offense” seems the “only way to get their attention.” Trump officials who think they’re “going to intimidate us and threaten and bully me into silence, and they’re going to go after political opponents and get us to back down,” have “another thing coming,” Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who also appeared in the video, said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://punchbowl.news/article/defense/dems-doj/" target="_blank">Punchbowl News</a>. “The tide is turning.”</p><p>There has always been a risk that Trump’s “politicized prosecutions will backfire,” both by “empowering the political martyrs they create” and by “exposing their own corruption,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://emptywheel.net/lamonica-mciver-prepares-to-hoist-todd-blanche-with-his-own-petard/?print=print" target="_blank">Emptywheel</a>. A new suite of legal motions from Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.), charged late last year by the DOJ for allegedly assaulting a federal immigration official during her effort to conduct an oversight visit at a Newark detention facility, suggests such a backfiring “may soon happen.”</p><p>The dynamic of Democrats facing overt hostility from Trump’s Justice Department and then seeking to capitalize on it was on display this week during Attorney General Pam Bondi’s testimony to the House Judiciary Committee. Bondi’s “hostile performance” in many ways “played directly into Democrats’ hands,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/11/pam-bondi-judiciary-epstein-trump-00777293" target="_blank">Politico</a> said. Democrats and “even some Republicans” believe “privately” that Bondi’s appearance will “probably help the Democrats during the fall midterm elections,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.salon.com/2026/02/13/trumps-washington-has-become-unrecognizable/" target="_blank">Salon</a>.</p><h2 id="what-next-6">What next? </h2><p>Beyond raising profiles and elevating potential political martyrs, Trump’s attacks on Democrats “often serve as their best fundraising tool,” said Politico. Oftentimes, Democrats’ “largest online fundraising spikes” occurred after a party member “stood up to or was attacked by Trump.” The public, meanwhile, seems to exhibit a “bit more skepticism” about Trump’s retributive prosecutions “than they ever did” the president’s own indictments, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/politics/trump-retribution-campaign-backfire" target="_blank">CNN</a>.</p><p>Americans believe by a 55%-45% margin that the indictments against Trump had been warranted, while a 58%-42% margin said the “charges against Trump’s foes were not justified,” according to a November <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MLSPSC29Toplines.html" target="_blank">Marquette Law School poll.</a> The poll was conducted during the administration’s effort to indict <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/comey-fbi-justice-department-trump-criminal-charges">former FBI Director James Comey </a>and New York Attorney General Letitia James, said CNN.</p><p>The White House’s “attempt to strong-arm” Kelly “into silence” with lawsuits and threats of military demotions has prompted the former astronaut and fighter pilot to respond in ways that “looked and sounded downright presidential,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/02/opinion/mark-kelly-2028-presidential-run/" target="_blank">The Boston Globe</a>. Still, if Kelly has presidential aspirations, he is “unlikely to announce them anytime soon.”</p><p>Meanwhile, lawmakers who appeared alongside Kelly have been slightly more forthcoming about their futures. Four House Democrats, including Crow, have “hinted” at plans for a “case of their own” after escaping indictment this week, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/seditious-six-dem-lawmakers-probed-trump-threaten-legal-battle" target="_blank">Fox News</a>.  “We are taking names,” said Crow. “We are creating lists.” His legal team has reached out to the Justice Department, “putting them on notice that there will be costs.”</p>

                                <p>Following backlash over the shooting deaths of two American citizens in Minneapolis, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ended its immigration surge in Minnesota. This may cool temperatures in Minneapolis, but ICE is now looking to implement immigration efforts in new cities, concerning Democratic officials that more social unrest could come.</p><h2 id="in-ice-s-sights">In ICE’s sights</h2><p>Several cities and states are reportedly on ICE’s list to send officers. One of the most notable is a Republican-led state. The Trump administration is “eyeing Ohio for immigration enforcement operations” that are “expected to target Haitian immigrants,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ms.now/news/ohio-ice-immigration-operations-haitians-tps-noem" target="_blank">MS Now</a>. This is largely due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/haiti-deportations-ohio-springfield">expiration</a> of their Temporary Protected Status earlier this month.</p><p>If this does happen, Springfield, Ohio, would likely be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/ice-violations-federal-judge-backlash">most targeted cities</a>. Springfield has an estimated Haitian population of 12,000 to 15,000 and was the target of a conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs that was spread by both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, later proven to be false. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials claim they do “not have concrete plans to launch immigration enforcement efforts in Springfield but plan to deport Haitian immigrants,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/central-ohio-news/ice-official-tells-judge-operations-against-haitians-in-springfield-would-have-happened/" target="_blank">WCMH-TV Columbus</a>.</p><p>Prominent Democrat-led areas are also likely to be in ICE’s crosshairs. In a public town hall for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials “asked the question: Could Northern California be the next target for a heavy-handed federal immigration enforcement crackdown?” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://localnewsmatters.org/2026/02/11/after-minneapolis-panel-says-bay-area-faces-new-legal-regime-may-be-next-target-of-ice/" target="_blank">Bay City News</a>. This concern follows claims that ICE would conduct immigration operations at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/sports/seahawks-beat-patriots-super-bowl-lx-bad-bunny">Super Bowl LX</a>, which took place in Santa Clara. (ICE agents did not end up patrolling the game, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/breaking-news/article/nfl-claims-that-ice-wont-be-at-super-bowl-in-conflict-with-previous-dhs-trump-administration-statements-001910079.html" target="_blank">NFL</a>.)</p><p>As a result, California counties like Oakland’s Alameda are “hoping to create a response plan” for ICE activities, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc7news.com/post/plan-moves-forward-prevent-ice-immigration-activities-alameda-county-property/18411283/" target="_blank">KGO-TV San Francisco</a>. This includes policy proposals to have “ICE-free zones.” These zones would “prohibit ICE from county-owned and controlled properties, such as the courts and hospitals.” Alameda County officials see these steps as “important safeguards for the community.”</p><h2 id="the-biggest-driver">The ‘biggest driver’</h2><p>There are also questions as to how ICE determines which cities to target. While the Trump administration has largely been quiet on this, former ICE officials have been more vocal. The “biggest driver would be immigrant population, how significant a population is there in that particular community,” John Sandweg, who served as director of ICE from 2013 to 2014, said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-former-ice-director-reveals-what-goes-agencys-decisions-cities-target" target="_blank">Fox News</a>. Another determinant is if there’s a “sanctuary policy that would increase the number of at-large targets," said Sandweg to Fox. Those are the “traditional factors that ICE would rely on in making determinations about where to do at-large surges.”</p><p>Despite DHS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/democrats-reform-ice-demands-shutdown">potentially losing funding</a> due to a partial government shutdown, these targeted enforcement efforts may not end soon. ICE “does not have the manpower” to target every city in the U.S., said Jacob Hamburger, a law professor at Marquette University, to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2026/01/22/minneapolis-ice-crackdown-leaves-milwaukee-wondering-if-its-next/87962798007/" target="_blank">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>. But the “point of a lot of these operations is to get everybody thinking, ‘What if we’re next?’”</p>

There is a “scriptedness to dating in a big city,” a “dance that nobody choreographed, but with distinct steps we’re supposed to pick up as we go.” People should “approach first dates as an opportunity to step into somebody’s world.

                                <h2 id="what-happened-4">What happened</h2><p>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, one of the South Asian nation’s two entrenched political factions, claimed a decisive victory this morning in Bangladesh’s first election since the 2024 student-led uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party, came in second.</p><p>Hasina’s Awami League, traditionally the BNP’s main rival, was barred from contesting Thursday’s election after its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/sheikh-hasina-why-ousted-bangladesh-pm-has-been-sentenced-to-death">exiled leader</a> was sentenced to death in November for her role in the deaths of 1,400 protesters.</p><h2 id="who-said-what-4">Who said what</h2><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/why-the-bangladesh-election-is-one-to-watch">The BNP won</a> more than two-thirds of 299 contested seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or parliament, while Jamaat secured at least 76 seats, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cd03znje072t?post=asset%3Ab928ba45-0d08-4c09-8ec6-6a03a8f4f070#post" target="_blank">the BBC</a>. Congratulatory messages for BNP leader Tarique Rahman, expected to become the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/world/bangladesh-prime-minister-resignation">next prime minister</a>, poured in from India, Pakistan, the U.S., China and other nations. <br><br>Rahman, 60, “returned to Bangladesh in December after living in exile in Britain for nearly two decades,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/world/asia/bangladesh-election-tarique-rahman.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> said. He “had a ringside seat to the growing pains of Bangladesh, a nation founded in 1971 partly by his father and run for years by his mother,” and during his short campaign he “promised to address the demands of the protest movement.” Along with electing a new government, voters approved democratic reforms, including term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence, in a referendum.</p><h2 id="what-next-7">What next?</h2><p>The BNP’s victory was seen as representing a “desire for stability after months of political turmoil, even if it meant voting for the old guard,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/bangladesh-votes-for-old-guard-in-first-elections-after-its-gen-z-revolution-27f99a68?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqd-02ZdPAG_2aR-Kbi7tePO_IZ4Dt6I2pVLIpZsj2Qcg7PUoHWWMjj1Lc2K4qI%3D&gaa_ts=698f5d8c&gaa_sig=3VNfiFHlKZZuihSXHSXyRkEA0heWLz5EumbhqaW-wGV7w7rSZIo4HFN5Vh5jAiz40_TTmnB17ZrsB_WIFZ47Ng%3D%3D" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> said. “The next few years will be crucial,” though, and if Rahman’s party “reverts back to the old system of patronage and cronyism, little will change despite Hasina’s downfall.”</p>

                                <h2 id="what-happened-5">What happened</h2><p>U.S. District Judge Richard Leon Thursday blocked the Pentagon from penalizing Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) over his involvement in a video reminding military officials of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushed for the senator and former Navy fighter pilot to be formally censured and demoted for the video, which also involved five other congressional Democrats with military or intelligence backgrounds.</p><h2 id="who-said-what-5">Who said what</h2><p>“This court has all it needs to conclude that defendants have trampled on Sen. Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in his 29-page opinion. “To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/things-donald-trump-said-about-military">respect from their government</a>, and our Constitution demands they receive it!” <br><br><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/mark-kelly-pete-hegseth-censure-lawsuit">Kelly’s lawsuit against Hegseth</a> and other Pentagon officials is “just one front in a broader dispute that has spiraled between the group of Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration since they posted the video,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-kelly-hegseth-illegal-orders-lawsuit-f028eade00c78123263bc3e28b3caa0e" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a> said. Earlier this week, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office tried to get a grand jury to indict the six Democrats for seditious conspiracy, but failed to “convince a single juror that they had met the threshold to bring charges,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/doj-fails-secure-indictment-democrats-involved-illegal-orders-video-rcna258385" target="_blank">NBC News</a> said.</p><h2 id="what-next-8">What next?</h2><p>Leon’s ruling bars the Pentagon from acting against Kelly while his lawsuit plays out. Hegseth said he would appeal. “Sedition is sedition, ‘Captain,’” he wrote on social media. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) “has been told the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-weaponization-czar-ed-martin-demoted-doj">Justice Department</a> could seek a new indictment” as soon as today against her, Kelly and the four other Democrats in the video, the AP said. “This might not be over yet,” Kelly said on social media, “because this president and this administration do not know how to admit when they’re wrong.”</p>

                                <h2 id="what-happened-6">What happened</h2><p>The Environmental Protection Agency Thursday revoked its 2009 “endangerment finding” that carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and the environment. The move ends the federal government’s legal authority to regulate those planet-warming pollutants. President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin immediately moved to eliminate all federal tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks. The repeal will also allow the EPA to complete its gutting of climate regulations on power plants, oil and gas wells and other stationary sources of pollution.</p><h2 id="who-said-what-6">Who said what</h2><p>Trump called Thursday’s repeal the “single largest deregulatory action in American history,” claiming it would end the “giant scam” of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-vought-climate-national-center-atmospheric-research">climate regulations</a> started by President Barack Obama. Obama said on social media that the reversal would make Americans “less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.”<br><br>Reversing the endangerment finding is a “knockout punch in the yearslong fight by a small group of conservative activists as well as oil, gas and coal interests to stop the country from transitioning away from fossil fuels and toward solar, wind and other nonpolluting energy,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/12/climate/trump-epa-greenhouse-gases-climate-change.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> said. The repeal “has been seen as the holy grail for those who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-pulls-us-key-climate-pact">deny the science</a> of climate change” because if upheld in court, “it could also prevent future administrations from restoring regulations to curb greenhouse gases.” <br><br>Instead of “challenging established climate science,” which the administration tried to do last year before losing in court, the EPA is pushing a legal argument “that the Clean Air Act was never intended to allow for regulation of greenhouse gases because climate change is a global phenomenon,” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/trump-epa-endangerment-finding-climate-regulation-00778446" target="_blank">Politico</a> said. The George W. Bush administration lost a similar fight before the Supreme Court, which ruled in 2007 that the EPA had the authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/health/clean-air-act-how-it-works">Clean Air Act</a>. That ruling led to the endangerment finding.</p><h2 id="what-next-9">What next?</h2><p>Environmental groups and Democratic-led states will “mount a fierce legal challenge to the repeal,” Politico said. Trump and his allies are “banking that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court” he helped install will ultimately reverse its 2007 decision.</p>

                                <p>US tech giant Palantir has wrapped its tentacles around the British state, securing major contracts with the Ministry of Defence and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/news/science-health/956032/pros-and-cons-of-privatising-the-nhs">NHS</a> in the last three years. However, many are questioning the transparency and procurement process of such deals, and asking whether the company’s ties to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/peter-mandelson-files-labour-keir-starmer-release">Peter Mandelson</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/world-news/israel-retrieves-final-hostage-body-gaza">Israel</a> and Ice could derail the UK.</p><p>The company was criticised this week by hedge fund manager Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale in the film “The Big Short”. He claimed that the tech firm had “systematically unreliable” third-party language models.</p><p>In a 10,000-word essay on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://michaeljburry.substack.com/p/palantirs-new-clothes-foundry-aip" target="_blank">Substack</a>, he said that the company’s $300 billion valuation will fall by more than two thirds once others realise that “Emperor Palantir has no clothes”.</p><h2 id="what-is-palantir">What is Palantir?</h2><p>Founded in 2003, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tech/palantir-all-seeing-tech-giant">Palantir is a technology company</a> that sells software that “processes large sets of data” to help clients, including governments, “find patterns and make operational decisions”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/business-us/article/big-short-michael-burry-claims-emperor-palantir-has-no-clothes-z9zpt00s6" target="_blank">The Times</a>.</p><p>Since it launched its “artificial intelligence platform” in 2023, it has recorded a “surge in sales growth”. The platform has allowed the integration of large language models created by the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tech/openai-creative-writing-sam-altman">OpenAI</a> and Anthropic into customers’ datasets.</p><p>Since this pivot three years ago, it has become a “stock market darling”, rising to a valuation of around $300 billion. Last year it “reported annual sales of $4.5 billion, up 56% year-on-year”.</p><h2 id="what-is-its-relationship-with-the-uk">What is its relationship with the UK?</h2><p>In December, Palantir signed a contract with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/defence/how-will-the-mods-new-cyber-command-unit-work">MoD</a> worth £240 million to continue its data analytics relationship. The contract is believed to be worth “three times more” than a previous MoD agreement signed in 2022, said the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/5bba355e-b8e3-4bc3-b440-750a23f8d48c">Financial Times</a>. In 2023, Palantir, as leader of a consortium, also won a seven-year £330 million contract to help manage patient data across the NHS.</p><p>In briefings to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/health/wes-streetings-power-grab-who-is-running-the-nhs">Health Secretary Wes Streeting</a> in June 2025, Department of Health and Social Care officials feared that Palantir’s associations with the Israeli military and Ice’s operations in the US would hinder the roll-out of the company’s Federated Data Platform in the NHS, according to documents seen by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>. This would mean the contract would not offer value for money for the UK government.</p><p>This has arguably materialised. According to NHS data, the number of organisations within the health service using Palantir’s technology has increased from 118 to 151 since June last year. However, this is “well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year”.</p><p>Doctors are now being actively told “how to limit engagement with the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP)” because of the “controversial” ties with Palantir, said the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.s246.full">British Medical Journal</a>. Given the US company’s “track record” with immigration enforcement and “risks to patient trust” and “data security”, there must be a “complete break” between Palantir technologies and the NHS, British Medical Association chair of council Tom Dolphin told the BMJ.</p><p>A spokesperson for Palantir said that its software is “helping to deliver better public services in the UK”, including “delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%”.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-concerns">What are the concerns?</h2><p>This week, the government came under pressure to review the MoD contract, due to Peter Mandelson’s links to the company, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/defence/article/palantir-ministry-of-defence-mod-wglwx6rvl" target="_blank">The Times</a>.</p><p>Mandelson co-founded and held shares in the lobbying firm Global Counsel, which worked with Palantir. Mandelson, as the UK’s ambassador to the US at the time, helped arrange a visit by Keir Starmer to Palantir’s showroom while he was in Washington in February last year and accompanied the PM on the visit.</p><p>During the visit, Starmer met Palantir CEO Alex Karp and the company’s UK chief Louis Mosley. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the FT that this should be “looked at very, very closely”, as the meetings “were not minuted” and she said that the MoD deal last year was a “direct grant of £240 milllion – not a tender, not a bid”.</p><p>Palantir has shown an interest in the British state in other ways, too. Last year it hired four ex-MoD officials, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/palantir-ministry-defence-hire-four-officials-2025-record-defence-contract-240-million/" target="_blank">openDemocracy</a>, as part of its “revolving door” recruitment, where firms “appoint outgoing ministers, senior civil servants and special advisers to lobbying or advisory posts”. Mosley also joined the MoD’s Industrial Joint Council, which the government describes as its “main strategic mechanism for defence sector engagement”.</p><p>More broadly, the £240 million MoD contract has “renewed a debate about Britain’s dependence on American technology”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/palantir-lands-biggest-ever-uk-defense-deal/" target="_blank">Politico</a>. Despite promises from the MoD that Palantir’s AI technology would accelerate decision-making and protection, the recent contracts raise “potential risks of technical dependence”, or “lock-in” with the US, especially at a time of “heightened trade and wider geopolitical tensions between the US and its traditional European allies”.</p>

                                <p>The International Olympic Committee has boasted that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/sports/what-to-watch-out-for-at-the-winter-olympics">Milano-Cortina 2026</a> is “the most gender-balanced Olympic Winter Games in history”. But there’s actually one sport women don’t even get to try.<br><br>For all the claims about “the highest level of female participation in Winter Games history”, the door is “slammed shut” for women in Nordic combined, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/milan-italy-nordic-denver-munich-b2914438.html" target="_blank">The Independent</a>. The three Olympic events where athletes compete in both ski jumping and cross-country skiing are strictly men-only, despite there being equivalent women’s World Cup and World Championship events.</p><h2 id="misogynistic-mindset">‘Misogynistic mindset’</h2><p>Nordic combined has been part of the Winter Olympics since its beginnings in 1924. It requires precision, courage, strength and endurance to follow the “daredevil thrill” of ski jumping with a “physically exhausting cross-country ski race”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/nordic-combined-milan-cortina-olympics-men-only-facing-elimination-f3209e7fc9d1d21f220ce7484c16a438" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>. It makes for a “two-day event unlike any other”.</p><p>Cross-country skiing has centuries-old origins in Scandinavian military training, which could be a partial explanation for the “misogynistic mindset” towards Nordic combined, said<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-02-11/winter-olympics-2026-milan-cortina-nordic-combined-inequality/105991114" target="_blank"> ABC News</a>. But it’s the combination with ski jumping that seems to be the decisive factor. While women had to wait until 1952 to compete in single-discipline cross-country events at the Winter Olympics, they were barred from ski jumping until the early 2000s. For decades, they were “deemed too fragile to stand up to the rigours of repeatedly hurtling themselves off the side of a mountain”. And it’s only at these 2026 Games that women ski-jumpers will be allowed to jump off the same large hill as the men.</p><p>To complicate matters for those campaigning against Nordic combined’s Olympic gender imbalance, the sport as a whole is “in jeopardy” – because it “doesn’t have a big following” and only “a small number of countries dominate the podium”, said AP. The IOC has “put the entire sport on notice”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7031182/2026/02/09/nordic-combined-2026-olympics-ioc-gender-equality/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, telling it to boost the number of participating athletes, “the size of the audience” and “the diversity” of competing countries or “risk falling off the Olympic programme altogether”.<br><br>The women of Nordic combined are not just “stuck sitting on the sidelines” while the men compete, they are “relying on the men’s performance to keep the sport’s future in the Games alive”.</p><h2 id="glacial-pace-of-change">‘Glacial pace’ of change</h2><p>Women have had a long fight for fair inclusion in the Olympics. They were excluded entirely from the first modern summer Olympics in 1896 and, when they were allowed to compete in Paris four years later, their participation was limited to a handful of sports, such as tennis, archery and croquet. Slowly, the exclusions for women have been mostly eliminated but the Winter Olympics, in particular, has changed “at a glacial pace”, said The Independent.</p><p>Female athletes staged a protest a fortnight ago at the Nordic combined World Cup, in Seefeld, Austria. They held up their ski poles at the starting line in the shape of an X, symbolising “no exceptions” for women’s inclusion at the Winter Games.</p><p>“I do what every single other athlete does,” US Nordic combined skier Annika Malacinski told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2026/02/10/nordic-combined-olympic-future-gender-equity/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>. “I work my ass off to be where I am. And yet there’s one group of people telling me I’m not doing it hard enough.” I cried for eight hours when I found out the IOC wouldn’t open Nordic skiing up to us at Milano-Cortina but I will continue to campaign for inclusion at the French Alps 2030 Winter Olympic Games.</p>

                                <p>We think of samurai as fearsome warriors – and they were, said Neil Fisher in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/art/article/samurai-british-museum-london-why-everything-you-knew-was-wrong-qj5cbwpcm?" target="_blank">The Sunday Times</a>. Yet if you visit Nomura Residence, an “elegant” house in the Japanese city of Kanazawa where generations of samurai lived, you’ll find it has delightful features, including an exquisite garden. Inside, you can see a fine piece of calligraphy – a letter written in 1566 to a samurai from his liege lord. “We appreciate that you worked so hard to kill one high-ranked soldier on the fourth of last month at the Yokokitaguchi Battle,” it says. “We are very happy that you brought us his head.”</p><p>The story of the samurai is, you realise, a “bundle of contradictions” – “elegance and formality, banality and butchery” – and that is how it is presented in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/art/silk-roads">British Museum</a>’s “blockbuster” show. It explores the role of the samurai and their pop-cultural afterlife – and in so doing, it clears up a few misapprehensions. The biggest is that the samurai were a “military sect”, when for centuries they were more “a privileged tier of society” that helped ensure the smooth running of the state. During the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), “about 10% of the population counted as samurai class”, half of whom were women.</p><p>The show takes you on a “scintillating journey” through “a world of gore, power and artistic beauty”, said Jonathan Jones in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2026/jan/29/samurai-review-british-museum-demonic-warrior" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>. The samurai were not the first to believe that, in battle, the warrior is transformed into something other. The Vikings had their berserkers, for instance. “But no culture has ever put quite as much creativity into blood-lust” as this one. When the samurai donned their armour – “so vital, so electric”, with their grimacing black masks – they would have seemed truly demonic. Even empty, the suits here “pulse with menace and mystery”.</p><p>There are lots of weapons on show too, and images of samurai in bloody battle – but also a painting of a warrior stopping to smell the blossom he is riding past, and another of a samurai making love to a courtesan while two other women “caress the blade of his unsheathed sword”. That perhaps encapsulates the appeal of this exhibition: the samurai were lethal but sexy, their warfare violent yet theatrical.</p><p>For samurai, who “aspired to be sophisticated courtiers and held the arts in high regard, beauty and brutality were intertwined”, said Alastair Sooke in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/reviews/samurai-british-museum-review/" target="_blank">The Daily Telegraph</a>. Some of their armour was positively dandyish; a 19th century quiver here glitters like a disco floor. The show is in three parts. The first covers the rise of the warriors as a fighting force in medieval times; the second – and most engrossing, in my view – is about the peaceful Tokugawa shogunate, when they morphed into bureaucrats; the third explores their impact on popular culture. The effect of this section, which includes comic books and an effigy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/james-earl-jones-classically-trained-actor-who-gave-a-voice-to-darth-vader">Darth Vader</a>, whose helmet was modelled on samurai armour, is bathetic, as if you’ve walked into a teenager’s bedroom. It’s a disappointing climax to an otherwise “riveting” exhibition.</p><p><em>British Museum, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/can-londons-pie-and-mash-shops-make-a-comeback"><em>London</em></a><em> WC1.

                                <p>The first in a line of a new generation of EVs – BMW is calling them the New Class, or Neue Klasse – the iX3 expunges “many or all of the annoyances of new-age EVs”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/bmw/ix3" target="_blank">Top Gear Magazine</a>. The car doesn’t feel “heavy or numb” to drive; it’s efficient; and charging times are “staggering” – you can pick up 200 miles of range in just ten minutes. It’s no exaggeration to say that the model marks a “revolution for BMW”.</p><p>If you’re after a “big, comfortable”, premium electric SUV, this car ticks all the boxes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whatcar.com/bmw/ix3/4x4/review/n22236" target="_blank">What Car?</a> said. It strikes a “great balance between ride comfort and driving fun”; it disguises its heaviness remarkably well and it’s practical, with tons of room for passengers and a generous boot. There’s only one version available from next month, the “very quick” 50 xDrive, but cheaper models are on the way.</p><p>The cabin is particularly “hi-tech”, and features a digital strip that sits across the dashboard, to keep key information in the driver’s eyeline, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/driving/article/bmw-500-mile-range-2026-ix3-ev-times-driving-9stbwhhb6" target="_blank">The Times</a>. There’s also an 17.9-inch infotainment touchscreen that features the usual controls for air con, radio and maps, but also supports apps such as Spotify and YouTube. You can even download Zoom – though you obviously won’t be able to take video calls while actually driving.</p>

                                <p>J.D. Vance opened last year’s Munich Security Conference (MSC) with an attack on the US’ European allies, stunning the world’s biggest defence summit.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/world-news/munich-security-conference-appeasement">year since</a>, Donald Trump has published the new US national security strategy, which outlined the desire for “strategic stability” with Russia and accused European leaders of “civilisational erasure” – a document <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/trump-security-strategy-europe-russia-america-first">praised by the Kremlin</a>. The president shook the foundations of the Nato alliance with his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/politics/greenland-lasting-damage-trump-tantrum">threats to seize Greenland</a>, imposed tariffs on friend and foe alike, and undermined Europe’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/news/world-news/europe/961821/who-is-winning-the-war-in-ukraine">defence of Ukraine</a>.</p><p>Ahead of this year’s conference, opened today by Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz, a report prepared by the MSC warns that the era of depending on the US is nearing the end. “Europe has come to the painful realisation that it needs to be more assertive and more militarily independent from an authoritarian US administration that no longer shares a commitment to liberal democratic norms and values,” it said.</p><h2 id="what-did-the-commentators-say-4">What did the commentators say?</h2><p>The MSC report “sets the scene for an all-out ideological confrontation with the Trump White House”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/09/europe-us-munich-security-conference-report" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>’s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour. The president’s remarks disparaging European Nato soldiers who fought alongside the US in Afghanistan caused “deep offence” among Europe’s military leaders. The MSC report also accuses Trump of having “a lust for destruction and of siding with Vladimir Putin”.</p><p>There are also “strong suspicions” that Germany’s hard-right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/politics/to-ban-or-not-to-ban-afd-german-democracy-at-a-crossroads">Alternative for Germany</a> was only invited to the MSC following “pressure from the Trump administration”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2026/02/12/afd-russia-munich-security-conference-spy-problem/" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>’s Berlin correspondent James Rothwell. The AfD was banned from the conference for two years for its “pro-Kremlin views”. Its attendance has “caused a furore” and there are fears the party will “use the summit as an opportunity to spy” – possibly for Russia.</p><p>Sergej Sumlenny, co-founder of the European Resilience Initiative Centre, a security think tank, has urged guests to “keep quiet about state secrets in the presence of AfD members” because whatever “sensitive topics” you’re talking about “stands a chance of making it back to Moscow”.</p><p>This year, Marco Rubio will be leading the US delegation. The “generally more restrained and tad more diplomatic” secretary of state is unlikely to emulate Vance’s “daylight throttling” of last year, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/forecast/munichs-test-of-power-politics/" target="_blank">Politico</a>’s Jamie Dettmer. But even if he does, Europeans are “becoming almost inured to Trumpian jolts”.</p><p>The focus in Munich will therefore be on “the practical steps necessary to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tech/can-europe-regain-its-digital-sovereignty">de-risk” from the US</a>, reduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/defence/is-europes-defence-too-reliant-on-the-us">reliance on its technology and military</a>, and “forge a much more independent” path with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/politics/mark-carney-canada-prime-minister">Canadians, who are “now honorary Europeans”</a>. Basically, this MSC will be about how Europeans “can stand on their own two feet”.</p><p>But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte spoke for many in the highly divided, deeply gloomy bloc: if EU lawmakers think they can do without the US, “keep on dreaming”, he said. “You can’t.”</p><p>The “unquestioned assumption of transatlantic cooperation” that always underpinned the MSC has been “upended”, but Europe’s dependence on US military support “will take years to undo”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trumps-upheaval-atlantic-alliance-loom-over-munich-security-forum-2026-02-13/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. It will also leave the continent “vulnerable”.</p><p>Plus Europe–US security ties have been damaged, but “they have not disintegrated”, said the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrzjv1kykxo" target="_blank">BBC</a>’s security correspondent Frank Gardner. “We still benefit enormously from our security and military and intelligence relationship with America,” said Alex Younger, former chief of MI6.</p><p>Ultimately, this MSC should “provide some answers on where the transatlantic alliance is heading”, said Gardner. “They just may not necessarily be what Europe wants to hear.”</p><h2 id="what-next-10">What next?</h2><p>On arriving in Munich, Rubio struck a “warmer tone” than Vance managed last year, said Reuters. But the Trump administration’s direction remains clear: Rubio’s next stops in Europe are Hungary and Slovakia. Washington has “hinted”, said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marco-rubio-us-visit-hungary-as-country-nears-towards-election/" target="_blank">Politico</a>, “that it could assist ideologically allied European parties”, such as the nationalist regimes of Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz in Hungary or Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico’s Smer.</p><p>“In an era of wrecking-ball politics, those who simply stand by are at constant risk of entombment,” the MSC report argues. Relying on “sterile communiqués, predictable conferences, and cautious diplomacy” is doomed to failure. “Effectively pushing back against the demolition men requires much more political courage and innovative thought. The actors defending international rules and institutions need to be just as bold as the actors who seek to destroy them.”</p><p>Those who “oppose the politics of destruction” have to “become bold builders themselves”. “Too much is at stake. In fact, everything is at stake.”</p>

                                <p>Most Americans may not expect a robot to perform their surgery, but AI-powered surgical tools are becoming more ubiquitous in operating rooms. While these tools are only used to assist human surgeons during operations and don’t perform surgery themselves, recent investigations, along with several lawsuits, are causing some medical experts to reconsider the use of AI in hospitals.</p><h2 id="what-kind-of-surgical-tools-are-powered-by-ai">What kind of surgical tools are powered by AI?</h2><p>At least 1,357 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tech/the-dark-side-of-how-kids-are-using-ai">AI-integrated</a> medical devices are “now authorized by the FDA — double the number it had allowed through 2022,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigations/ai-enters-operating-room-reports-arise-botched-surgeries-misidentified-body-2026-02-09/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> as part of an investigation into AI-assisted surgery. One of the most notable is the TruDi Navigation System, a device manufactured by Johnson & Johnson that uses a “machine-learning algorithm to assist ear, nose and throat specialists in surgeries.” Other AI-assisted devices are designed for surgeries on other parts of the body.</p><p>Many of these tools address the “area of vision enhancement,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/09/24/robots-and-ai-are-rewriting-the-future-of-surgery/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. Traditional laparoscopic surgery “presents surgeons with significant challenges: smoke obscures the surgical field, two-dimensional images make depth perception difficult and critical anatomical structures can be hard to distinguish.” AI surgical tools can eliminate these obstacles and provide surgeons with “crystal-clear views of the operative field.”</p><h2 id="what-has-the-result-been">What has the result been? </h2><p>There has been an influx of allegations and lawsuits against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/tech/ai-cannibalization-model-collapse">various AI tools</a>, many of which claim these tools actively harmed patients. Several of these involve the TruDi tool, as the FDA has “received unconfirmed reports of at least 100 malfunctions and adverse events” related to the device’s AI, said Reuters. Many of the alleged errors occurred when the AI “misinformed surgeons about the location of their instruments while they were using them inside patients’ heads.”</p><p>In one case, this reportedly led to cerebrospinal fluid leaking from a patient’s nose, while in another case, a surgeon “mistakenly punctured the base of a patient’s skull,” said Reuters. Two other cases allegedly led to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theweek.com/health/how-music-can-help-recovery-from-surgery">patients suffering strokes</a> after major arteries were accidentally injured; in at least one of these cases, the plaintiff said the TruDi’s AI “misled” the surgeon, causing him to “injure a carotid artery, leading to a blood clot and eventually a stroke,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/ai-surgery-tool-injuring-patients-lawsuits" target="_blank">Futurism</a>.</p><p>FDA reports on malfunctioning devices “aren’t intended to determine causes of medical mishaps, so it’s not clear what role AI may have played in these events,” said Reuters. But TruDi is not the only AI-assisted medical device that allegedly has performance issues. One machine that analyzes prenatal images using AI, the Sonio Detect, has been “accused of using a faulty algorithm” that “misidentifies fetal structures and body parts,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/adding-ai-to-sinus-surgery-system-saw-malfunctions-rocket-from-eight-to-100-incidents-according-to-new-investigation-skull-puncturing-errors-are-the-stuff-of-nightmares" target="_blank">Tom’s Hardware</a>. And Medtronic, a company that manufactures AI-assisted heart monitors, has faced allegations that its monitors “failed to recognize abnormal rhythms or pauses in patients.”</p><p>Overall, at least 60 AI-assisted medical devices have been linked to 182 product recalls by the FDA, according to research published in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2837802" target="_blank">JAMA Health Forum</a>. At least 43% of these recalls “occurred within the first 12 months” of the device’s FDA approval, said JAMA. This suggests that the FDA’s approval process “may overlook early performance failures of AI technologies.” But there is hope that the issue can be fixed, as shoring up “premarket clinical testing requirements and postmarket surveillance measures may improve identification and reduction of device errors.”</p>

                                <p>Trying to become pregnant, whether you are struggling with fertility or not, can be an incredibly stressful process. When it comes to conception and nine months of pregnancy, there is plenty of advice for how to be at your healthy best. However, an emerging social media trend has influencers convincing people that the key to a healthy pregnancy lies in how you prepare during the time leading up to it.</p><h2 id="what-does-zero-trimester-mean">What does ‘zero trimester’ mean?</h2><p>On <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/business/tiktok-larry-ellison-new-owners">TikTok</a> and Instagram, the “cultural obsession with wellness and optimization” has come for the “murky preconception period,” coined the “zero trimester” by sociologist Miranda Waggoner in her 2017 book by the same name, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/pregnancy-zero-trimester-influencers/" target="_blank"><u>Wired</u></a> said. A growing number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/culture-life/utah-media-influencers-mormons-momtok-franke">influencers</a>, holistic health experts and even doctors are “posting content that speaks to the ‘Trying to Conceive’ (TTC) demographic,” including “women who are struggling to conceive and those who haven’t started yet.”</p><p>Their message is simple: If you “follow this wellness formula,” you will “set yourself up for the quickest conception, the easiest pregnancy and the healthiest child,” said Wired. Essentially, they believe that having a healthy<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/health/glp-1s-complicated-questions-pregnancy-ozempic-stop"> pregnancy</a> boils down to the choices you make before you even become pregnant.</p><p>Pregnant women have “long been subject to endless rules on how to treat their bodies,” said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecut.com/article/pregnancy-trimester-zero.html" target="_blank"><u>The Cut</u></a>. But increasingly, it feels like the “goal post has been moved back.” The recommendations from zero trimester influencers range from drinking raw milk to filtering air.</p><p>The “pregnancy prep” creators encourage lifestyle changes, courses, books and tips to follow during the six to 12 months before becoming pregnant. On her podcast, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theweek.com/politics/maha-moms-backlash-kennedy-pesticides">MAHA</a> influencer Alex Clark recommends that women trying to get pregnant “stop wearing nail polish,” while holistic nutritionists claim it’s important to avoid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPmWlMzEglq/?hl=en" target="_blank"><u>iced beverages</u></a>. Other influencers are posting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS7xY7zDU-I/?hl=en" target="_blank"><u>meditation</u></a> journeys to “lower cortisol six months before trying to conceive,” while some are ordering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG4KiB2O-lo/?hl=en" target="_blank"><u>micronutrient labs</u></a> and “embarking on 60-day pregnancy-prep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHlSeiHR1Ee/?hl=en&img_index=6" target="_blank"><u>detoxes</u></a>.”</p><h2 id="is-the-advice-worth-listening-to">Is the advice worth listening to?</h2><p>Many people struggle to get pregnant, and some doctors agree that the standard medical advice just to wait and see is failing them. Yet claims “about the importance of trimester-zero strain credulity,” said The Cut. Listening to some of these influencers, it is “easy to come away thinking that if you struggle to get pregnant or have a difficult pregnancy, it’s your fault.”</p><p>Some experts argue that the new attention surrounding the zero trimester is a “very positive, exciting development,” as healthy moms “usually spell better outcomes for mom and baby,” said Wired. There are so many things that can be done to “optimize underlying health in that preconception year that will make outcomes in pregnancy better,” Natalie Clark Stentz, an ob-gyn and infertility specialist at Michigan Medicine, said to Wired.</p><p>Still, prep should be “expert-vetted and backed by science,” and it “usually doesn’t involve the TikTok Shop,” Wired said. Any “buzzy individual thing is likely sensational,” whether that’s “Brazil nuts, organ meats or whatnot,” Stentz said. Evidence-based recommendations are “not sexy” — suggestions like maintaining a “normal BMI, stop smoking, pick a boring prenatal vitamin.”</p><p>Pregnancy prep regimens being touted by influencers can also “get pricey fast,” Wired said. They are taking a “very vulnerable, very highly motivated population of patients” and targeting them with “information that is kind of driven by financial incentives,” Kara Goldman, an ob-gyn and associate professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Northwestern University, said to Wired. The marketing can “disguise the fact that even going into pregnancy in peak health is not a guarantee,” said the outlet.</p><p>The zero trimester trend can “make women feel guilty or blame-worthy if their outcome isn’t ‘perfect,’ however they’re defining perfect,” said Waggoner. It promotes the idea that there is a “causal and deterministic link between preconception care behaviors and birth outcomes,” and that is what “can be problematic for both individuals and at a policy level.”</p>
