During my year-end break in December, I&#x2019;ve had a good opportunity to muse about where I want to steer my writing at large, and where I want writing to steer me. Here are the resulting goals and methods.</p><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2><ol><li><strong>Nurture evergreen writing &#x1F331;.</strong> Continue the transition I started in 2025 of writing <a href="https://jatan.space/indian-space-issue-33/">longer longform articles</a> on <a href="https://jatan.space/about" rel="noreferrer">my space blog</a>. Keep doing more pieces that will retain utility over time rather than newsy posts with short lifecycles. News as a hook with added context and analysis, like on <a href="https://jatan.space/tag/moon-monday" rel="noreferrer">Moon Monday</a>, is better than news relayed for the sake of it.</li><li>Publish at least one booklet globally on space exploration, building on and refining <a href="https://jatan.space/presenting-seven-uni-verses-poetry/#merging-the-worlds-of-blogs-and-books">the foundation</a> I laid with my <a href="https://jatan.space/seven-uni-verses-poetry/">space poetry pamphlet</a> last year. &#x1F319;</li><li>Transform this blog, <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/about" rel="noreferrer">Journal J</a>, into a home for my refined words and verses on all things non-space. I&#x2019;m excited about this.</li><li>Share <a href="https://thoughts.jatan.space/links" rel="noreferrer">interesting links</a> on Thought Brew.</li><li>Write freely for the self.</li><li>Draft poetry in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_language">Hindustani</a>&#xA0;(Hindi-Urdu) instead of just English.</li><li>Build the courage to publish some things I normally wouldn&#x2019;t.</li></ol><h2 id="methods">Methods</h2><ol><li>Continue curating, tracking, and absorbing longform web writing <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/why-use-rss/">through an RSS reader</a>. Ruthlessly cull all shortform feeds. Tune into interesting websites and blogging philosophies by participating in <a href="https://blr.indiewebclub.org">IndieWeb Club BLR</a> meets. &#x1F913;</li><li>Read more books but choose carefully. Attend book clubs &amp; events at&#xA0;<a href="https://attagalatta.com">Atta Galatta</a> in BLR.</li><li>Continue to not use AI/LLMs to write a single word. It would kill my brain and soul.</li><li><a href="https://jatan.space/how-i-avoid-hot-takes-and-speculations/">Keep avoiding hot takes</a> and largely speculative coverage</li><li>Stay <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/digital-detox-story/">inactive on social media</a>, especially to not pollute my thinking and writing.</li><li><strong>Stay quietly connected.</strong> Have my own blogs on my own web domain be enabling spaces to interact with readers via <a href="https://jatan.space/connect" rel="noreferrer">emails and DMs</a> instead of using terribly <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/introducing-linktalk/">context-deprived</a> and <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/an-internet-without-intent/">noisy</a> social media.<ol><li>Reach out to others directly as well. People remain the best signal to noise filters.</li><li>Extend the philosophy experimentally to <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/one-sane-fediverse-profile-to-rule-them-all/" rel="noreferrer">Fediverse replies</a>, <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/webmentions-enabling-better-communication-on-the-internet/">Webmentions</a>, and other direct means.</li></ol></li></ol><hr><p>I might not achieve all of these goals or necessarily always stick to each method but they will remain my north star. What are your writing goals and methods for this year? <a href="https://jatan.space/connect" rel="noreferrer">Let me know</a>.

But Mastodon and the most of the Fediverse platforms are&#xA0;<a href="https://journal.jatan.space/mastodon-and-the-fediverse-is-noisy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">too noisy</a>&#xA0;by default, having borrowed likes, boosts &amp; reposts, follower counts, and hashtags from traditional social networks without re-assessing their utility for supposedly non-algorithmic community building.&#xA0;</p><p>I want something that can connect to the Fediverse in a quieter way. My attention first turned to&#xA0;<a href="https://ghost.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ghost</a>, which already powers my flagship&#xA0;<a href="https://jatan.space/about" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">space blog</a>&#xA0;as well as <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/about" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Journal J</a>. But Ghost&#x2019;s Fediverse integration is too basic as of now. More importantly, it still has noisy likes, reposts, their notifications, and follower counts &amp; suggestions like a micro-posting network despite being a longform publisher platform. Their Reader section is good, and the only saving grace, but I&#x2019;m disappointed that Ghost did not build a Fediverse experience that&#x2019;s longform-focused first and foremost. So I decided to use&#xA0;<a href="https://micro.blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Micro.blog</a> as the foundation of&#xA0;<a href="https://bits.jatan.space/fediverse/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">my Fediverse profile</a>&#xA0;because it offers several advantages:</p><ul><li>No support for likes and boosts/reposts, stripping them off the UI completely.</li><li>The notifications area contains just a feed of Mentions and Replies from others, with an added indicator for Direct Messages.</li><li>No follower notifications or counts. I have no clue who follows me unless they engage, which is great.</li><li>No hashtags. In fact, Micro.blog will try to hide the spammy hashtags at the end of posts. Good riddance because I hate hashtags.</li><li>No trending posts or suggested followers section. That Mastodon has these bad network effects is puzzling.</li><li>Posts from&#xA0;<a href="https://jatan.space/blogs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">all my blogs</a>&#xA0;get auto-shared to my profile thanks to Micro.blog&#x2019;s feature to pull from RSS feeds of your blogs.</li><li>Relatedly, I don&#x2019;t like small post editors that limit in feeble amounts what I write and how I think. Which is why it&#x2019;s great that Micro.blog allows you to automatically show entries from your external blogs in apt ways in the Timeline! So that&#x2019;s the route I took.</li><li>There&#x2019;s an option to hide Replies from the Timeline, making it cleaner while still retaining the ability to open any conversation.</li><li>Micro.blog offers RSS feeds of my Timeline, and even of individual profiles, so I can&#xA0;<a href="https://journal.jatan.space/why-use-rss/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">use RSS</a>&#xA0;to follow the Fediverse instead of relying on inferior apps to sort, filter, and search posts. Mastodon does support profile RSS feeds as well but using Micro.blog means I can strip off noisy boosts and reply posts.</li></ul><p>These should make the experience clean and focused. Lastly, I used&#xA0;<a href="https://fed.brid.gy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Bridgy Fed</a>&#xA0;to enable Bluesky integration, saving me the hassle of having to keep around yet another social media account.&#xA0;</p><p>I actually have&#xA0;<a href="https://journal.jatan.space/digital-detox/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">been off social media</a>&#xA0;since last year. Admittedly though, a Fediverse account on my own domain does makes fundamental sense to try breaking big tech and&#xA0;<a href="https://journal.jatan.space/an-internet-without-intent" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">social media jails</a>. But it still feels like&#xA0;<a href="https://journal.jatan.space/realizations-about-actually-avoiding-social-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">breaking the law</a>&#xA0;when blogs over the web are social by themselves. However,&#xA0;<a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Webmentions</a>&#xA0;are simply too complicated for me to even understand properly, much less implement and deal with for my blogs. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve decided to try this Fediverse experiment in a sanitized and sandboxed way as a middle ground. Feel free to&#xA0;<a href="https://bits.jatan.space/fediverse/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">follow me on Fedi</a>, but remember that I won&#x2019;t see that you followed or be notified of likes and reposts. I only see replies and mentions. &#x1F60C;</p><p>If even after all these guardrails, the Fediverse turns out to be more noise than signal&#x2014;because, humans&#x2014;I shall go back to not existing on digital socials.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A new year, a new blog to brew]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>So I&#x2019;ve started a new blog, <a href="https://thoughts.jatan.space" rel="noreferrer">Thought Brew</a>, to share <a href="https://thoughts.jatan.space/links" rel="noreferrer">interesting&#xA0;links</a> I come across as well as some notable thoughts and instances from life on Earth.

The blog&#x2019;s centerpiece though would be the links,&#xA0;sometimes shared with quotes or linked commentary. After all, the originator of the <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/introducing-linktalk/">idea of LinkTalk</a> also has to be the one practicing link-blogging seriously. Links, especially inline ones, are not merely a component of the web, they&#x2019;re the web itself&#x2014;a fact social networks <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/never-link-to-instagram/" rel="noreferrer">like Instagram</a> want to cull you from. Hyperlinking is collective thinking. Tracy Durnell aptly captured this in her article &#x2018;<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/09/19/long-live-hypertext/">Long live hypertext!</a>&#x2019;:</p><blockquote>As an online writer,&#xA0;<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/">my philosophy is&#xA0;link maximalism</a>; links add another layer to my writing, whether I&#x2019;m linking to an expansion of a particular idea or another person&#x2019;s take, providing evidence or citation, or making a joke by juxtaposing text and target. Links reveal personality as much as the text. Linking allows us to&#xA0;<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/01/30/a-decentered-argument-as-website/">stretch our ideas</a>, embedding complexity, acknowledging ambiguity, holding contradictions. [...] It&#x2019;s <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/">interconnected</a>&#xA0;in a way and degree that&#x2019;s not possible for print formats.</blockquote><p>With Thought Brew, serving thoughtful links like a daily cup of tea or coffee will complement the <a href="https://jatan.space/i-write-for-you/">extensive infusion of links</a> present in <a href="https://jatan.space/about" rel="noreferrer">my writing on space</a>. If a stream of curated link posts sounds like a beverage you&#x2019;d enjoy, follow along via <a href="https://thoughts.jatan.space/subscribe">Email</a>&#xA0;or <a href="https://thoughts.jatan.space/feeds">RSS</a>. &#x2615;&#xFE0F;</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-yellow"><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Note:</strong></b> Before following this&#xA0;third blog of mine, make sure you&#x2019;re subscribed to the best of my words on&#xA0;<a href="https://jatan.space/about" target="_blank">space</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="https://journal.jatan.space/about" target="_blank">all else</a>. Honestly, you can also skip this new third blog altogether to get fewer but better words from me. Well, unless you just love to <a href="https://thoughts.jatan.space/links">click for curiosity</a>. &#x1F31D;</div></div><p><strong>P.S. </strong>I decided against link-blogging on this place you&#x2019;re reading, <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/about" rel="noreferrer">Journal J</a>, because you didn&#x2019;t originally sign up for frequent updates. As such, it would violate our implicit agreement. Another consideration was that I aim to transform Journal J into a home for my refined words and verses on all things non-space.</p><p>The logistics of it all might sound complicated but it&#x2019;s not when you remember how many social media platforms people juggle. I&#x2019;m <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/digital-detox/">not active</a> on social media nor do I intend to be. Having a blog or a few to express freely on any topic and be heard at the scale of human, without the <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/an-internet-without-intent">algorithmic slurp</a> and <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/instant-publishing-and-misinformation/">slop</a>, is sufficient. And as a reader, you can follow only the blog(s) you want without any FOMO of another.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apps and digital tools I liked in 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[And you might too. 💻]]></description><link>https://journal.jatan.space/default-apps-2025/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6952666b89cdcc0001729d73</guid><category><![CDATA[Essays & Musings]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jatan]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:38:31 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="https://rknight.me">Robb Knight</a> started <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">this trend</a> wherein people list apps they use or prefer for various purposes.

I hope you&#x2019;re having a refreshing break as well this year end.

The last time the &#x2018;king of the manufacturing hill&#x2019; got knocked off the throne was when the US surpassed the UK just before WW1. It took the US the better part of a century to rise to the top; the China-US switch took about 15 or 20 years. China&#x2019;s industrialization, in short, defies comparison.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://journal.jatan.space/content/images/2025/07/top-countries-gross-production-comparison-1995-2000.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1400" height="760" srcset="https://journal.jatan.space/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/top-countries-gross-production-comparison-1995-2000.jpeg 600w, https://journal.jatan.space/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/top-countries-gross-production-comparison-1995-2000.jpeg 1000w, https://journal.jatan.space/content/images/2025/07/top-countries-gross-production-comparison-1995-2000.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Comparing gross production shares of top countries during the period 1995 to 2020. </span><a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/china-worlds-sole-manufacturing-superpower-line-sketch-rise" rel="noreferrer"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Image: OECD TiVA database (2023)</span></a></figcaption></figure><hr><h3 id="how-did-china-become-a-manufacturing-superpower"><a href="https://yogesh-upadhyaya.medium.com/how-did-china-become-a-manufacturing-superpower-7322c3058d8" rel="noreferrer">How did China become a manufacturing superpower?</a></h3><p><em>&#x2013; Yogesh Upadhyaya</em></p><blockquote>China has kept most of its commodity and energy producers in the public sector. What is more, the prices that these businesses can charge have been regulated. This meant that the terms of trade were favorable for manufacturing companies using these commodities. Many authors describe how China has resisted pressure to go to a system of &#x2018;market prices&#x2019; for such inputs.<br>[...]<br>A high level of support can make entrepreneurs complacent. This has not happened in China. One of the big reasons is fierce competition. The decentralized nature of the country&#x2019;s governance and the entrepreneurial nature of the society means that there were hundreds of companies in many sectors.</blockquote><hr><h3 id="china-shows-science-is-not-dependent-on-liberal-democracy"><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2024/09/10/china-shows-science-is-not-dependent-on-liberal-democracy/" rel="noreferrer">China shows science is not dependent on liberal democracy</a></h3><p><em>&#x2013; Caroline Wagner</em></p><blockquote>Since 1990, China&#x2019;s national spending on research and development increased at a rapid clip.

These students will likely end up in influential positions back home, yet colleges treat them basically like cash cows. They often arrive bombarded with propaganda about America, which is reinforced by the prevalent discourse at universities. And they find themselves isolated by language barriers and cultural differences. Giving these future leaders a genuinely positive experience in America might be the best thing we can do to improve US-China relations in the long run.</blockquote><hr><h3 id="ancient-china"><a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/china/" rel="noreferrer">Ancient China</a></h3><p><em>&#x2013; Joshua Mark</em></p><blockquote>The Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) is considered the &apos;golden age&apos; of Chinese civilization. Gao-Tzu prudently maintained and improved upon the bureaucracy initiated by the Sui Dynasty while dispensing with extravagant military operations and building projects. With minor modifications, the bureaucratic policies of the Tang Dynasty are still in use in Chinese government in the modern day. By the time of the rule of Emperor Xuanzong (712-756 CE) China was the largest, most populous, &amp; most prosperous country in the world.</blockquote><hr><p>Do you have recommendations for what I should read next to better understand China&#x2019;s growing and leading technological capabilities? <a href="https://jatan.space/connect" rel="noreferrer">Email or DM me</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[For the love of RSS feeds, simplify your blog’s subscribe page]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I love reading blogs, newsletters, and virtually anything else on the Web through <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/why-use-rss/" rel="noreferrer">RSS feeds</a>.

As a <a href="https://jatan.space" rel="noreferrer">space writer</a>, it&#x2019;s the best way for me to keep track of, read, and search what hundreds of sources publish every week. And, I proactively offer my own readers an option to subscribe to <a href="https://jatan.space/blogs" rel="noreferrer">my blogs</a> through RSS. Even though I have thousands of email subscribers, I care about this option because it provides people a private and reliable way to read my blogs without having to trust me with their email IDs. Why offer anything less than what you prefer yourself?</p><p>However, most people don&#x2019;t know what RSS feeds are, and how feed readers can benefit them. I wrote an <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/why-use-rss/" rel="noreferrer">accessible article about RSS</a>, which anecdotally made some headway within my friends and little network of humans. But even then most people have a notion that RSS is complicated to use. These notions carry terse truths. Compared to the ease of following someone on social media or subscribing to a newsletter, it&#x2019;s far from obvious what you&#x2019;re supposed to do when you encounter an RSS feed icon or link. Even for people who do know about and use RSS readers, it&#x2019;s still a chore to manually hunt, grab, and add RSS links to their feed readers. How do we simplify this?</p><p>I redid my space blog&#x2019;s <a href="https://jatan.space/feeds/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>RSS feeds page</strong></a> to offer big buttons for people to subscribe to my posts on every feed reader I could think of. Did you check the page already?</p><p>Clicking or tapping on any button on that page does one of these two things:</p><ol><li>If you already use that particular feed reader service/app, you can add my blog to it in two taps. Bam.</li><li>If you don&#x2019;t use that reader, most of them will present you with a login &amp; signup option. This way people can directly use a feed reader with at least one blog added instead of having to imagine and figure out what they are and how they work.</li></ol><p>Isn&#x2019;t this solution better than the status quo? At least fellow netizens <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/05/31/announcing-subscribe-openly" rel="noreferrer">James</a> and <a href="https://multiline.co/mment/2025/05/request-for-feed-reader-app-developers/" rel="noreferrer">Ashur</a> agree. I went ahead and added these two-tap buttons on my personal blog&#x2019;s <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/feeds/" rel="noreferrer">feeds page</a> as well. &#x1F913;</p><p>These direct-subscribe links work based on <a href="https://feedbin.com/help/how-to-subscribe/#url" rel="noreferrer">special dynamic URLs</a>. I&#x2019;ve hunted down special URLs for more than 20 feed readers for my feeds pages. Very few RSS readers are missing from the list, and that&#x2019;s only because they don&#x2019;t support such a URL structure or scheme&#x2014;as far as I can tell. I&#x2019;ve reached out to various such developers to add support for the same. I&#x2019;m hoping to add direct-subscribe links for <a href="https://reeder.app/classic/" rel="noreferrer">Reeder Classic</a>, <a href="https://feedgrab.net" rel="noreferrer">Feedgrab</a>, <a href="https://miniflux.app" rel="noreferrer">Miniflux</a>, and popular Android-only apps. Any tips you have for me to add those or other RSS apps/services are <a href="https://jatan.space/connect" rel="noreferrer">welcome</a>.</p><hr><p><strong>P.S.</strong> I absolutely know that many people will still find RSS confusing and just won&#x2019;t use it. That war is for another day&#x2014;perhaps if and when the Web is about to come full circle to blogs from the <a href="https://journal.jatan.space/an-internet-without-intent/" rel="noreferrer">clutches of social media</a>? For now, I&#x2019;m happy to have made the RSS situation at least a little better than I found it. This is the kind of post which is so niche that most people will wonder what I&#x2019;m even rambling about. But I don&#x2019;t care because it has made me happy.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Took the day off against my will, and thankful for it]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I&#x2019;ve been quite productive this month, chief of which has entailed publishing a spree of long articles.

Notably, all of these pieces have been on different topics, each concerning an unusually important development in its own niche within the space industry. Because of their very newsy nature, it wasn&#x2019;t possible to not write about them. Such is the nature of journalism. And I wasn&#x2019;t content with writing about them the way it was already covered either. And so I ended up with concerted back-to-back efforts in publishing my analysis and commentary on <a href="https://jatan.space/moon-monday-issue-227/">NASA&#x2019;s abysmal budget proposal</a>, India&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href="https://jatan.space/indian-space-issue-28/">PSLV rocket&#x2019;s failure</a>, ispace Japan&#x2019;s <a href="https://jatan.space/moon-monday-issue-228/">crash landing</a>, and China&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href="https://jatan.space/moon-monday-issue-229/">growing lead in lunar orbital infrastructure</a>.<br><br>Today I woke up, freshened up, and began the work day like I would usually. But I just couldn&#x2019;t get meaningful thoughts to exist, much less flow. Giving the brain  more time and trying to catalyze the process with good reads or music did not work either. Every end was dead. Clearly, the streak of articles had taken their toll at last. One of the few perks I do get as an <a href="https://jatan.space/about" rel="noreferrer">independent writer</a> is to be my own boss. I don&#x2019;t use that privilege loosely, and much prefer to set scheduled tasks for each day of the work week. But today my mind was just frozen. There weren&#x2019;t any immediate self-imposed deadlines, and so after some initial reluctance, I decided to just let it be and called off the work day.</p><p>I slept through the afternoon, then walked in the park, had a nice butter vada pav, did some physical and digital chores, and then read a bit on my Kindle over a big cup of chai (tea). One of those reads was about the fascinating problem of <a href="https://globalchinapulse.net/character-amnesia-in-china/" rel="noreferrer">character amnesia in China</a>. Allow me to quote the very first para which will make you click with intrigue:</p><blockquote>During a visit to Beijing many years ago, I was having lunch with three PhD students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all of whom were native speakers of Chinese. I happened to have a cold that day and was trying to write a brief note to a friend to cancel an appointment that afternoon. I found that I could not recall how to write the Chinese characters for the word &#x2018;sneeze&#x2019;. I asked my three friends to write the characters for me and, to my surprise, all three simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the characters.</blockquote><p>I end the day writing this blog post, which has brought back my fluid thoughts. And now I can sleep in peace. And, maybe this post provided you some perspective for when you find yourself in a similar situation?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Newsletter for friends #06: Time flies]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hi friends,</p><p>It&#x2019;s again been over three months since I sent out the&#xA0;<a href="https://journal.jatan.space/newsletter-for-friends-05/" rel="noreferrer">previous newsletter for friends</a>.
