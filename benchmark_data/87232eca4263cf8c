    Introducing my slip-box: <a href="https://explog.in/slipbox/">https://explog.in/slipbox/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    I take org notes in <a href="https://logseq.com">logseq</a>; which are then processed with a tiny
    python script &amp; published using Emacs's org-export with an automatic
    Github Action every few hours.

    <title>Building Developer Tools</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    After spending a large part of my career building tools, I realized I
    had unconsciously followed a consistent framework for
    identifying and building developer tools. It seemed like a good idea
    to make it concrete -- both for sharing and collecting feedback --
    leading to this series of posts.
    </p>

    <p>
    I've been tweaking this series for a few months at this point, and
    it's really exciting to finally call it done (for now).

    Seeing RSS entries published in Recurse Center's aggregator made me
    realize that the links/entries being published in the feed were
    broken. This is an attempt at fixing them.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    I've reworked how expLog is generated to make it easy to publish by a
    Github Action, with a shell script to run emacs in batch mode to make
    this significantly easier.
    </p>

    <p>
    The RSS feed became a casualty of this work, but I finally got around
    to fixing it today, and I hope it gets picked up seamlessly for anyone
    who had subscribed in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
    PS. I've been publicly iterating on a series of posts on <a href="https://explog.in/notes/devtools/index.html">building
    developer tools</a>; I'm still editing, but I should be finished soon. Let
    me know if you have any feedback!

    <title>A simple neural network</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Belatedly realizing that it's surprisingly simple to implement a
    neural network from scratch, particularly if you don't care about
    using it in production -- some developer notes and a snapshot of a
    basic net in roughly ~150 lines of Rust with minimal dependencies.

    (Unrelated aside: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFvKvdznUdc">A Notebook Style Guide</a> (<a href="https://github.com/kunalb/nbstyle/blob/master/ANotebookStyleGuide.ipynb">Slides</a>) -- a short talk I
    gave at JupyterCon 2020 was released on YouTube. It started <a href="https://explog.in/notes/nbstyle.html">as a blog
    post</a> here earlier this year.)

    <title>An introduction to Panopticon</title>
    <link>https://explog.in/https://explog.in/notes/panopticon.html</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Panopticon is a Python tracer I've written as an alternative to using
    a debugger. Instead of manually stepping through code, I'd much rather
    have a computer do it for me.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since writing this post panopticon has evolved to include <code>probes</code>:
    which can instrument code you might not have full control over.
    </p>

    <p>
    (I'd initially written this post as documentation, but ultimately
    realized it's better suited as a post and I can do a much better job
    of documentation within the project.)

    <title>A brand new RSS feed appeared!</title>
    <link>https://explog.in/rss.html#org77cd204</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    This structure of this blog is almost completely maintained by hand: I
    manually add entries to the index page, often going back to edit
    existing posts, and several entries are perennial -- such as my Book
    list, as well as the syntopical collections on different sets of
    books.
    </p>

    <p>
    That makes it fairly tricky to automate an RSS feed: at the same time,
    enough (4) people have directly reached out to request one. Instead of
    spending a lot of time building automation that will will inevitably
    frustrate me, I've decided to maintain it by hand instead (with <code>ox-rss</code>
    for exports). That means that there aren't going to be any entries for
    my older posts unless I happen to go back and significantly rewrite &amp; update them.
    </p>

    If you happen to be new -- welcome! -- and I hope you find the content
    worth your time; and I'd love any feedback. A semi-curated selection:
