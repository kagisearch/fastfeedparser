										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gathered during the Generative AI hype cycle, this collection of worker perspectives is a window into the complex relationship between workers and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies we use (or are forced to use) and produce, but also resist and subvert…</p>



<p>Each worker interviewed for this project is intimately involved in shaping the future of AI across all aspects of work and society. The collaborators that conducted these interviews and crafted this zine are an interdisciplinary group of researchers, workers, and artists who believe that AI will reflect the faults, biases, and harms of the status quo — until we work together to demand participation and ownership.</p>



<p>Why this zine ? Why now?</p>



<p>We started this zine in 2023, seeing the very real ways workers were organizing with/against AI, as well as in our own workplaces and industries that were pushing for us to use or otherwise center Generative AI tools. We wanted to create a zine that centers worker responses as well as the real and present impacts – not just another pie in the sky, top-down, policy report or framework.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) are a disciplinary practice used by managers to exert power and control. Here's what you can do when a coworker gets PIP'ed.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2024/what-to-do-if-you-get-piped/">What To Do If You Get PIP&#8217;ed</a> appeared first on <a href="https://collectiveaction.tech">Collective Action in Tech</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On paper, the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is common practice used by management to help low-performing employees get back on track. In reality, PIPs are a disciplinary practice used by managers to exert power and control. Increasingly, it is also used as an obfuscated&nbsp; form of retaliation and a precursor to firing dissident employees. As organizers, we should be on the alert when our coworkers are put on a PIP.</p>



<p>This is a playbook with linked resources developed for coworkers who are supporting someone&nbsp; who has been&nbsp; put on a PIP, but the model is flexible and can be applied to a variety of situations, from other non-PIP disciplines. It could be adapted to be the collective action for a colleague who’s been under-leveled or someone who’s not getting a promotion they deserve.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Before the PIP is delivered</h1>



<ol>
<li>Make sure you stress in all your interactions with your contacts that if they start to get negative performance feedback, loop you in ASAP</li>



<li>Once their manager says they’ll be getting put on a PIP, your contact should email their manager immediately invoking their Weingarten rights, saying that they want their union steward present at the PIP delivery meeting. Make sure you get added to any email threads or calendar invites and get forwarded any existing documentation.</li>



<li>Get details from your contact about what’s going on, any historical context etc. Try to suss out what’s motivating the PIP — is there a genuine performance issue or is there some vendetta? What’s their relationship like with their teammates? Will they support them?</li>



<li>Find out what their goals around the situation are. Do they want to stay at the company? Do they want to look for another job? Do they want to try to negotiate severance? Talk to them about their other options and figure out if this PIP playbook is the best way to support them for their goals. This plan requires a lot of work; they may want to use the PIP duration just to support a company-paid job search rather than trying earnestly to pass it.</li>



<li>Reach out to your union staffers and leadership to make them aware of the situation and get feedback and suggestions.</li>



<li>Add the information to any <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c3BtmoUde4vDyrICckTUA0FpFoz7upuZfe9e8UUihew/edit#gid=0">trackers</a><sup data-fn="bcd6714c-f88b-4ce9-b14e-40473b3c523a" class="fn"><a href="#bcd6714c-f88b-4ce9-b14e-40473b3c523a" id="bcd6714c-f88b-4ce9-b14e-40473b3c523a-link">1</a></sup> you have for member discipline (with appropriate confidentiality measures per your union’s policies)</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">In the PIP delivery meeting</h1>



<p>In the meeting you’re there as an advocate and to push back if you can.</p>



<ol>
<li>Push back against anything in the PIP that seems unclear, out of scope for this person’s role/level, or difficult to measure. HR or labor relations will likely try to shut down edits to the PIP, but the manager might be receptive if you point out things that are truly unclear or wrong. Point out where an expectation is in conflict with the career ladder. Use your expertise as a peer: you know when things are unreasonable for your role.</li>



<li>Ask questions:
<ul>
<li>How did the PIP come about? Management won’t concede that any previous management was poor, even if it was and HR will say we’re not here to litigate the PIP — but say it’s important to understand the history so that you can best support your colleague through the duration of this PIP.</li>



<li>How will success be measured? Really dig into each requirement to ensure there’s alignment and mutual understanding on what success looks like.</li>



<li>Do you think these goals are realistic to complete within this period of time?</li>



<li>Who will ultimately decide if the member passes the PIP? Who’s the decision-maker who your contact should be aligning with throughout the PIP to see if their performance is on track to pass?</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Emphasize how seriously we’re taking this. Management will evade and try to not give you specifics; tell them that that’s an unacceptable way to approach something with such high stakes as whether someone keeps their job. A bit of grandstanding about how this is someone’s livelihood is not unwarranted.</li>



<li>Ask that the PIP have a provision that it gets extended for every day the contact is out sick, so the PIP ends up the same amount of working days. Try to maximize the length of the PIP, whether it’s to give your contact more time to show results or buy them runway for their job search.</li>



<li>See if there’s room to soften the PIP consequences, like failing the PIP results in downleveling rather than termination.</li>



<li>Take word-for-word notes of the interview.</li>



<li>If the member wants during the meeting you can ask for a caucus too either to discuss things or to just give them a break.</li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">After the meeting</h1>



<ul>
<li>Send a follow-up email recapping points of agreement, documenting any points of disagreement or things management wouldn’t agree to, and capturing any action items like if they said they needed to discuss something before getting you an answer</li>



<li>Debrief with your contact — how do they think it went? Does the PIP feel passable to them?</li>



<li>Meet with your union rep and legal counsel, if available, to go over the PIP and get any thoughts.</li>



<li>Add the PIP to your union Drive in a secure location with the appropriate privacy controls.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">During the PIP</h1>



<p>You should check in with your contact regularly during the PIP — at least weekly for a one-month PIP. Ask about how their check-ins with their manager are going and whether they’re getting any indication of how the manager feels the PIP is going.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Support rotation</h2>



<ul>
<li>Copy and fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQu_2iE0YuV3eB4sFMj7b5d-pA4b3YYlFDHK-cUe9R8/edit#gid=0">[Times Tech Guild] Team support rotation template</a> with the PIP goals</li>



<li>Ask your contact to meet 1:1 with all team members they want to tell about the PIP and bring into the support rotation and have them explain the situation</li>



<li>Organize a kickoff meeting with all the teammates and your contact to explain the support rotation. Ask them to sign up to do shoutouts on specific days</li>



<li>The shoutout format depends on what’s available at your company and what norms are. Workday, for example, is an HRIS that has a shoutout feature; that’s nice because it’s in the official HR system and goes to their manager. Slack is great because it’s very public. You can also choose to take advantage of multiple formats.</li>



<li>Throughout the PIP, make sure people are doing the shoutouts they signed up for and check in frequently with the support team</li>



<li>Your contact should collect screenshots and/or contemporaneous notes for each shoutout and email them to their manager.
<ul>
<li>E.g. [Name] Shout Outs</li>



<li>Send a separate reply to the same email thread for each shout out</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Success Tracking</h2>



<ul>
<li>Copy the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BmdKnCbQ8IIS_WYZEIfJGzqmcDEcZy1TGQB1o1fbsb8/edit#gid=559394283">[Times Tech Guild] PIP success tracking</a> and fill out with all goals that your contact will be measured against in the PIP. Adjust the goals legend as necessary</li>



<li>Your contact should set up a <em>daily </em>meeting with their manager to discuss that day’s progress. Late afternoon or early morning work best as you can discuss a complete day.
<ul>
<li>The manager should share their screen and edit the tracker during the meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The contact should go through line-by-line describing any relevant details for the day.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Your contact should request that their manager rate them on each item in real time. Add a grade &#038; a comment justifying said grade. Ask them: <strong>“If the PIP ended today would I have a job tomorrow?”</strong>
<ul>
<li>If scored anything other than Complete/Achieved, the manager should include an explanation of how to either get back on course, stay on course, get unblocked, or why the item wasn’t relevant to the day’s discussion.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Be sure to have your contact send contemporaneous notes/screenshots of the grades and comments so that you can keep your own records.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Managers may not feel comfortable saying “you would pass” so explicitly. Continue to ask for the clearest answer possible. “How can I perform up to your required standards if you don’t indicate when I have met them or not?”</li>



<li>As soon as the PIP ends, the contact should alert you and as many teammates as they feel comfortable contacting on the final status of the PIP. If the manager says “you passed” on June 15, it’s helpful to have 15 texts saying “my manager told me I passed.”</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Further work</h1>



<p>There are many other processes that can be built out related to this, like a resource guide for terminated employees on employment lawyers, avenues for legal action like EEOC charges, how to apply for unemployment benefits, a GoFundMe. You could set up a mentorship network to help an employee who is actually struggling to perform in their role to find colleagues who can help that person in the target areas. You could build out more fields on the discipline tracker to identify trends across demographics. You could look for patterns of bad managers and come up with collective actions to support employees working under them. I’d love to hear how you use and adapt this!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since October 7th, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">30000+ Palestinians</a> have been murdered by Israel in its devastating bombing campaign &amp; invasion of Gaza. These horrific actions have triggered unprecedented global mobilization in support of Palestine. Millions of people have hit the streets, all demanding a ceasefire and an end to the occupation of Gaza. However, these calls have been entirely ignored by the Israeli government, the United States and their Western allies. Rather, Western political and corporate leadership (to the extent that these are separate categories) have rallied together to endorse, fund and even run cover for Israel’s war crimes in Gaza.</p>



<p>This complicity is particularly evident in the tech industry. The largest tech companies <a href="https://www.notechforapartheid.com/#big-tech">provide Israel with the technological means</a> to implement its mass bombing campaigns. Our industry generates billions in revenue at the expense of innocent Palestinian lives. Despite that, for as long as tech executives and venture capitalists have been profiting off of apartheid, tech <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/when-polaroid-workers-fought-apartheid/">workers have been organizing in resistance to it</a>. That tradition continues to this day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this critical moment of heightened political engagement, tech workers are demonstrating increased activism. Particularly in the movement for Palestinian liberation, many workers are participating in external actions such as protests, vigils, and teach-ins. However, there exists a sense of isolation within the workplace. It’s often challenging for politically active individuals to connect their struggles with like-minded colleagues in their professional lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, when Palestinian solidarity emerges in the workplace, we’re witnessing management crack down. We’ve seen this suppression manifest through the one-sided censorship of pro-Palestinian voices on company channels and the distribution of internal memos that deliberately ignore Palestinian suffering.</p>



<p>For these reasons, it is incumbent on us as tech workers to organize in our workplaces, <strong>connecting workplace solidarity with the broader cause of Palestinian liberation</strong>. We will not be complicit in apartheid. We will not be complicit in genocide. This guide is intended to be a starting point, to help you get started with organizing in your workplace and understanding your rights when doing so.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Organizing in the Workplace for Palestine: Quick Start Guide</strong></h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Identify Allies and Connect Through Company Channels:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Identify other politically engaged individuals within the workplace by leveraging existing company channels. Be aware that your employer is able to access your communications in these channels and exercise appropriate caution.</li>



<li>Utilize Slack, email relevant mail-groups (e.g., Muslim resource group, religious resource groups, etc.) to identify potential allies.</li>



<li>Initiate the process by posting a message that invites like-minded individuals to join a dedicated private group focused on discussions around Palestinian solidarity.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Template for Company Channels Message:</p>



<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#eeeeee">Subject: Join a Dedicated Group for solidarity around Palestine. <br><br>Hi [“team” or workplace-specific alternative for team], in light of the current events surrounding the horrors being inflicted on Palestinians, we are forming a group to create a safe space for open discussions. If you are interested, please join us on [chosen communication platform] using this [link or contact details]. <br><br>Let&#8217;s support each other through these difficult times.</p>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Shift to Secure Communication Platforms:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Recognize the sensitivity of discussions around Palestine and create a secure space for open dialogue.</li>



<li>Transition the conversation to platforms like Signal or WhatsApp, that are not managed by your employer, depending on the prevalent tool within the group.</li>



<li>Lock down the group chat, such that new members must be explicitly approved by an admin, to maintain confidentiality and control membership access.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Conduct 1:1s to Build Trust:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Schedule individual calls with group members to break the ice and create a conducive environment for open discussion.</li>



<li>Building trust through personal connections is vital for fostering a strong collective effort.</li>



<li>The ultimate goal is to conduct one-on-one meetings with individuals within the group to understand their perspectives, motivations, and identify shared issues related to Palestinian solidarity.</li>



<li>Larger group calls can be great icebreakers and open the door to more 1:1 conversations.</li>



<li>Some of your coworkers may have prior organizing experience or connections to outside groups that could be helpful, or have ideas for organizing or direct action within the workplace- these 1:1 conversations are a two-way street for you to get to know each other and begin to brainstorm!</li>



<li>This is an incredibly difficult time for many of us. By connecting in this way, we help lift each other up and build supportive relationships that are few and far between in our workplaces.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Keep Sensitive Discussions Limited to ICs (Individual Contributors) and Non-HR:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Recognize the potential risks associated with including managers and HR in discussions around sensitive topics like Palestine.</li>



<li>Establish a wide-net discussion forum initially to avoid raising suspicions, then create a separate forum excluding managers and HR where discussions can be more candid.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Even though some people in management or HR might be strong allies on this issue, or even personally affected, their positions with respect to your employer are fundamentally different from an IC’s, and being part of the most sensitive organizing conversations may put them or you in a very difficult or vulnerable position. This has nothing to do with who they are as people! But the structure of the workplace dictates that their relationship to your bosses, and your relationship to your bosses, are structurally different and come with different risks, incentives, and pressures.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Take Small Collective Actions:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Initiate small, collective actions within the workplace to raise awareness and show solidarity.</li>



<li>Examples include updating Slack photos and statuses or posting together on company channels. Even simply saying the term &#8220;Palestine&#8221; on company channels can be a major step forward in some workplaces.  These seemingly small collective actions are often the start of greater solidarity.</li>



<li>Expand actions beyond the workplace by collectively attending city-wide protests or actions to build trust and solidarity.</li>



<li>One of the most impactful collective actions we can be taking in the workplace is to identify and document the ways in which the company is complicit in Israeli war crimes.
<ul>
<li>As workers, we are uniquely situated to understand this complicity. However, this knowledge is often dispersed amongst the workforce with any given worker only having a small, isolated piece of the broader picture.</li>



<li>In your solidarity group of coworkers, you’re likely to find representation from many different departments and functions at your company. By bringing these folks together, you’ll now be able to discuss questions such as:
<ul>
<li>Who are our vendors?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Who are our customers?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Who uses our technology and what do they do with it?&nbsp;</li>



<li>What data do we store?&nbsp;</li>



<li>What do we do with this data?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>In doing so, you will all collectively gain a much broader understanding of your company&#8217;s relationship to the ongoing conflict and perhaps others.</li>



<li>Further, by consolidating and documenting this knowledge, your group may identify opportunities for collective actions you may take in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>By identifying politically engaged individuals within the workplace, creating secure communication channels, conducting personal 1:1s, and initiating small collective actions, tech workers can effectively connect workplace solidarity with the broader movement for Palestinian liberation. These best practices lay the foundation for a united and impactful collective effort within the workplace.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where You’re Protected</strong></h1>



<p>The reality of U.S. labor law is that there are few protections for political speech in private workplaces. Legal outcomes are also highly case-specific and depend on the evidence you can present for why you were wrongfully fired, demoted, or otherwise retaliated against. Nevertheless, there are portions of labor law that offer workers some protection. It is important to be aware of what kind of activities they cover to stay protected. Below is a brief overview that we hope will encourage you to dig deeper and&nbsp;seek legal advice if you believe a particular category of protections applies to your organizing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f349.png" alt="🍉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> First Amendment Rights</h3>



<p>The First Amendment protects the free speech of government employees if they are speaking as private citizens about a matter of public concern and their speech does not interfere with their work. “Public concern” includes broader social and political issues. Workers should steer clear of using any government platforms to speak out or presenting themselves as representatives of any government institutions. In cases where there may be any doubt, e.g. a social media account that includes your job title, make it clear that your views are your own. The ACLU has a useful <a href="https://www.acludc.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/free_speech_fed_employees_kyr.pdf">flowchart</a> that outlines possible exceptions to this rule.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there are no such federal protections for employees of private companies. There may be some protections depending on your state, however. <a href="https://islamophobia.org/anti-prejudice-tools/guidance-to-u-s-employees-in-response-to-islamophobic-and-anti-palestinian-rhetoric-in-the-workplace/">California</a>, for instance, says that employers may not prevent their employees from participating in the political arena. <a href="https://islamophobia.org/anti-prejudice-tools/guidance-to-u-s-employees-in-response-to-islamophobic-and-anti-palestinian-rhetoric-in-the-workplace/">New York</a> prohibits discrimination against political activities that take place outside the workplace and off-duty. <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/pages/employee-free-speech-in-the-workplace.aspx">Oregon</a> has a Worker Freedom Act that does the reverse– it prohibits <em>employers</em> from requiring employees to attend political meetings or distribute political communications. The <a href="https://islamophobia.org/anti-prejudice-tools/guidance-to-u-s-employees-in-response-to-islamophobic-and-anti-palestinian-rhetoric-in-the-workplace/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> offers some resources and consulting to help activists understand their state laws.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f349.png" alt="🍉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Discrimination</h3>



<p>A number of state and federal laws, most notably the <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/public-policy/hr-public-policy-issues/pages/titleviiofthecivilrightsactof1964.aspx">Civil Rights Act</a>, protect against discrimination based on protected classes, which include religion, race, and nationality. Notably, this applies in cases of hiring, firing, and promotion or receiving any other kind of employment-related benefit. The <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> handles charges of discrimination and maintains a well-resourced site that answers questions about what constitutes discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discrimination may occur as a result of participation in political protest. For instance, if your employer uses racial, ethnic, or religious slurs against you in the aftermath of your political activity, you should keep careful documentation of the incident and find witnesses to the event, if possible. If you then experience any kind of retaliation, you may have a case against them. You are also protected if you discuss incidents of discrimination with other employees, including asking if they have experienced similar issues (see the next section). There are ways to file a charge with the EEOC <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/confidentiality">anonymously</a>. Legally, an employer may not retaliate against you for filing a charge even if you do not file anonymously.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f349.png" alt="🍉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Organizing to Improve Working Conditions</h3>



<p>Workers in the U.S. are protected when they speak out about working conditions to their coworkers through Section 7 of the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a>. You do not need to be a member of a recognized union or any other organization to exercise these rights. Working conditions include discussions about pay and benefits, working hours, and workplace safety and surveillance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While your political organizing itself may not fall under protected concerted activity, if you are being abused or surveilled by your manager and you discuss these issues with other employees, those discussions <em>are</em> protected. If you experience retaliation as a result of your discussions with other employees about your workplace safety and surveillance, you may have a case under the NLRA.<em> </em>In one case of non-profit employees in California (<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/31-CA-093108">31-CA-093108</a>) employees complained about a verbally abusive manager and then were fired two days later. According to the NLRB, the conversation between the employees’ constitutes protected activity.<br><br>This law does not protect you if you make disparaging comments about your employer that are <em>not </em>related to working conditions or if you are spreading misinformation. If you believe you have been retaliated against for activity that is protected under the National Labor Relations Act, you may want to consider filing an <a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2022/a-layoff-guide-for-tweeps/">Unfair Labor Practice (ULP)</a> charge with the National Labor Relations Board. This process grants you certain legal protections and can help you win back-pay and potential reinstatement for wrongful termination.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Best Practices if You Experience Retaliation</strong></h1>



<p>Protesting and organizing against your own company’s contribution to war is only one of many ways to support the worldwide solidarity campaigns for the people of Palestine. Joining in direct actions and protests organized by groups in your community is a great way to be involved outside of the workplace. Even if your company doesn&#8217;t have direct ties to ongoing military efforts, there are many ways you can stand in solidarity with Palestinians.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f349.png" alt="🍉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> What We&#8217;re Seeing on the Ground </h3>



<p>That being said, we are seeing escalating professional retaliation against <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/er-doctor-lenox-hamas-israeli-festival-stop-dina-diab-2023-10">doctors</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/3-harvard-columbia-law-students-lost-job-offers-israel-statements-2023-10">law students</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/10/philadelphia-sports-reporter-loses-job-pro-palestinian-comments">journalists</a>, who are being fired or forced to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/business/media/new-york-times-writer-resign-israel-gaza-war.html">resign</a> after expressing solidarity with Palestinians. We are also seeing suppression of pro-Palestinian speech in the tech industry. Even workers who are not protesting their own company’s contracts with Israel or the IDF, at workplaces where no such ties are present, are facing reprimands and the threat of firing for exercising pro-Palestine speech on their own social media pages or on company Slack channels. The policies cited in each of these cases of retaliation are nebulous at best, and weaponize bad-faith accusations of antisemitism or claim that pro-Palestine speech is support for “terrorism”. These tried and true McCarthyist tactics are used to silence pro-Palestinian speech.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f349.png" alt="🍉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Organizing Against Retaliation</h3>



<p>One way to stand in solidarity with Palestine in your workplace is to organize to defend yourself and your coworkers from professional retaliation for pro-Palestine speech, both at work and on your personal time.&nbsp;Protecting each other so that you can all speak up about injustice creates space for continued public outrage about the genocide happening in Gaza, which is necessary for moving public opinion further and changing the political situation. Free speech is necessary for this movement, and retaliation in the workplace is an effective silencing tactic. Fighting against this silencing is crucial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This could look like<strong> organizing an “emergency retaliation response committee”</strong> that can support a worker pulled into a disciplinary meeting and advocate on their behalf. It could even look like <strong>organizing a solidarity pledge that your coworkers can sign,</strong> saying that if any of you are fired for exercising free speech on this issue, you will strike until those workers are reinstated, making it clear to your bosses that an injury to one is an injury to all.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f349.png" alt="🍉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Retaliation Support and Resources</h3>



<p>If you experience retaliation, you don’t have to go through it alone. Reach out to trusted coworkers as soon as you can to let them know what’s going on- your coworkers care about you and will want to help! At the very least, many of your coworkers will be angry about unfair retaliation. Supporting each other begins with sharing information, and then you can form a group that can brainstorm what kind of collective actions you can take together to defend your job. You also have legal recourse. If you are in a union, your union’s stewards or grievance officers can help you file a grievance and possibly an unfair labor practice charge against your employer. If you are in a union you also have “<a href="https://www.ueunion.org/stwd_wei.html">Weingarten rights</a>,” meaning that you can take another member of the union with you into all meetings that you think might result in your discipline.<br><br>Regardless of whether you are in a union, you can reach out to <a href="https://palestinelegal.org/">Palestine Legal</a> or <a href="https://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> that are collecting reports of professional retaliation for pro-Palestine speech and organizing. These organizations can provide guidance and/or legal help. If you are worried about doxxing, Palestine Legal put together a <a href="https://www.equalitylabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ADVANCE-COPY_-EQUALITY-LABS-ANTI-DOXING-GUIDE-FOR-ACTIVISTS-3.0.pdf">resource</a> on the best practices for protecting yourself and your personal information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-left has-background" style="background-color:#eeeeee">We were asked by a few friends at Twitter to publish this collection of tips that workers have been sharing across the company as they face the threat of mass layoffs.<strong> </strong><em>Reach out to <a href="mailto:collectiveactionintech@protonmail.com">collectiveactionintech [at] protonmail.com</a> if you’re a Twitter worker who is looking for support from your fellow Tweeps or you have tips to share. </em>We’ll connect you safely.<br><br>&#8211; Collective Action in Tech</p>



<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#505050"><em>Last updated 11/3/2022</em></p>



<p>Hello fellow Tweeps,</p>



<p>The next few weeks will continue to be difficult. We will see many of our colleagues laid off and some may be maliciously “terminated for cause.” Across Twitter, our coworkers are sharing what we’ve learned about layoffs and how we can get through this as safely as possible. We’ve collected the best advice from alums offering mutual aid and our many thoughtful colleagues who continue to face the stark reality that we might not have jobs tomorrow.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What To Expect&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Don’t rely on fair or reasonable treatment from the company. Hope for the best but plan for the worst.</li>



<li>You will likely lose access to all company systems before being notified that you are terminated.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Assume everything you do on work accounts and work devices is traceable and monitored.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Your manager is obligated and incentivized to follow instructions from leadership. Do not assume your manager will be willing or able to help you, even if they want to.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know Your Rights</h2>



<ul>
<li>Some states require employers with over 100 employees to give 60-90 days advance notice. Check if your state has adopted the WARN Act (aka min-WARN act).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Some states have single party consent laws that allow you to legally record audio. You are acting as the single consenting party. If you can, record your meetings so you have evidence if you need it in the future for wrongful termination. If you’re not in a single party consent state, get creative. Have a colleague in one of these states hop on the phone to help you record and document any layoff conversations.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lean on Each Other</h2>



<p>Many of us feel isolated and alone right now. It can mean a lot to get a DM from someone you work with that demonstrates we’re here for each other. Here’s how we suggest you reach out safely:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Download Signal if you haven’t already so your communications are not on company channels monitored by management.</li>



<li>Ask your coworkers if they want to chat in a Signal group you’re setting up with other ICs on the team.</li>



<li>Kick off the Signal group chat by validating that this moment is hard and asking how folks are feeling.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Ask what people are hearing from other coworkers. They might know something that can give you insight into your status or have a helpful layoff tip.</li>



<li>Share a resource or even this guide if you think it will be helpful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Make it clear that you are here for them and that now is the time for Tweeps to lean on each other.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Responding to Unreasonable Requests</h2>



<p>Tweeps across the company have been pulled into new projects and asked to work 24/7 to deliver in unreasonable time frames. These requests are often coupled with the empty promise that it might save your team from the layoffs as a manipulation tactic.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Take care and don’t overwork yourself. The intimidation we’re seeing from leadership is a malicious productivity tool. Don’t be afraid to push back, especially if your coworkers are also pushing back.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Screenshot (using a personal mobile device) all written asks made of you and anything that can prove what you’re being pushed to do is unreasonably outside of the norm of your role. You might need this if you need to take legal action.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Screenshot (using a personal mobile device) anything that shows what the norms and procedures are of your team. Again, you might need this if you need to take legal action.&nbsp;</li>



<li>If you are asked to do anything that violates policy, like FTC rules, please reach out to the tip line email contact below. Taking shortcuts can bring personal risk.</li>



<li>If you have some spare cycles, reach out to your coworkers to offer support. If they need some coding help, pair programming, or even help with writing docs and cross-functional communication, a little can go a long way. Or, start talking to them about creative ways you can work together to push back on the untenable pace.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Control your Data</h2>



<p>So much is out of your control right now but what happens to your data isn’t. It can be extremely helpful to proactively save resources and data belonging to you just in case your access is suddenly revoked.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Notes on Surveillance</h3>



<ul>
<li>At no point should you plug any type of <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26d4.png" alt="⛔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />External storage</mark></strong> (SD card, HD, thumb drive) into your work device. This is traceable and monitored.</li>



<li>Sending <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-amber-color"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Google Docs</mark></strong> from Gmail to personal accounts <em>probably</em> violates your agreement with the company, even if those documents do not contain sensitive information. Downloads and sharing to other accounts or creating links is monitored and can be used to justify “for cause” termination.</li>



<li>Twitter is analyzing <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-amber-color"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Google Drive </mark></strong>data and looking for anomalies. Downloading or sharing in bulk will trigger an investigation.</li>



<li>One of the safest ways to capture documentation is to simply snap a pic from your personal phone.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Login / Account Management</h3>



<ul>
<li>Go through your 1Password and find personal accounts that you will use outside of your employment at Twitter and change them to your personal email.</li>



<li>Save the contents of your 1Password to your personal laptop with Dropbox, change the Dropbox email to your personal email. This will help you access personal services in case you lose access to 1Password on your work device.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Ensure that any accounts you’ve setup with your @twitter.com email account are moved to your personal account. This includes your Schwab account, or even accounts with discounts (i.e. Uber Eats, DoorDash or Avis).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Sign out of all personal accounts on your Twitter laptop.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Move your comp letters, redacted promo packets, redacted impact docs, promo letters, and pay stubs (on Workday) to your personal laptop. It’s imperative you have access to your key employment documents.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Change your linked Birdhouse Twitter account to a personal email and “unlink” your personal twitter account from your Birdhouse profile</li>



<li>Make sure your <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202667">iCloud is transferred</a> to your personal email.</li>



<li>Though the associated email address cannot be changed, Schwab ePayWindow is accessible from a personal laptop outside the VPN.</li>



<li>Backblaze automatically uploads all of your files to the cloud. If you saved personal files on your computer, someone might be able to restore them. <a href="https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/articles/217665368-Deleting-a-Backup">Learn how to delete backups</a> while you have access.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://wd5.myworkday.com/twitter/d/home.htmld">Workday</a></h3>



<ul>
<li>(If applicable) Record your accrued bonus/PDP. Ensure this amount is included in your severance. In Workday > Profile > Job > Additional Data tab > scroll to the bottom where it says “PDP”.</li>



<li>Download all payslips by going to “view profile” in Workday (by clicking on your face in the top right hand corner). Most information can be downloaded in a single PDF from the link at the top of the blue sidebar, just next to your employee photo.</li>



<li>Go to the My Compensation and Metric Letters tab to download all pdfs.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Go to the Performance Review tab, click &#8220;create new pdf&#8221; then &#8220;notify me later&#8221; for each doc. The PDF links will appear in the table after a minute or so, then you can download them all.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use Your Benefits At Your Own Risk</h2>



<p>Your benefits are part of your compensation and you’ve earned them. Although these are owed to you, it is not guaranteed that you will be reimbursed. Keep this in mind if you spend your benefit stipends. Use your benefits if you still can (or while they still exist), at your own risk. You can find your full list of benefits at go/benefits. File all pending expense reports in Concur and immediately ask your manager to approve.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for a Malicious “For-Cause” Termination</h2>



<p>The new leadership has dramatically changed the expectations of workload across the organization. It is now expected that teams work evenings and weekends to ship products. Work progress is being tracked by the hour in spreadsheets to build precedent for terminating workers “for cause” to avoid paying severance. Here is what you can do now to ensure you’re best suited to defend and refute an unjust termination:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assume your termination might be presented as performance-related and that the metrics used to define “performance” may be illogical to anyone with an understanding of your role.</li>



<li>Update your <em>Impact Document</em> to reflect everything you’ve worked on at Twitter. Make sure it contains all of the challenges you’ve overcome to get projects completed. This is important context for anyone reviewing your case who is not familiar with the norms of your role. If you aren’t familiar with this type of document, ask your manager for a copy of your most recent promo-packet. By adding on your more recent accomplishments, you will more-or-less have an updated Impact Document.</li>



<li>Request feedback from your peers! Before your team composition changes, make sure you reach out to trusted colleagues and request feedback from them. It might be good to break the ice with the offer of providing feedback for them. We’re all in this together.</li>



<li>Consider transcribing any relevant personal (not company-sensitive) information from any self-reflection or self review Google docs you wrote about yourself, any work logs describing things that you did, any promo packs you wrote for yourself, feedback docs written for you by other people, documents or contracts signed (from:echosign.com captures some of these), any details of pension, life insurance, medical insurance or other benefits if you have not saved them elsewhere, you get it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p><em>On July 16th, 2022, Hyatt Dirbas spoke with Willy Solis, Lead Organizer for Gig&nbsp;Workers Collective, about organizing in the tech industry and workplace as a gig worker.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>HD: Who should be organizing in the tech industry?</strong></p>



<p><strong>WS:</strong> All workers should be organized in the tech industry. Gig workers in general, have been taken advantage of and exploited. It&#8217;s really important for workers to gain back power and the only way to do that is to organize.</p>



<p><strong>HD:&nbsp; What should they be organizing around? What would you tell your co-workers that they should organize around?</strong></p>



<p><strong>WS: </strong>They should organize around the basic labor protections. I think that&#8217;s really important at the very most fundamental level. Gig companies are working really hard to exploit workers by taking advantage of basic labor protections. It&#8217;s really important that workers realize that at the end of the day the main issue is that labor protections are being exploited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HD: And what kind of labor protections are we talking about? What are some examples?</strong></p>



<p><strong>WS:</strong> Sure the most basic fundamental labor protections.&nbsp; For example, I mean if I get hurt on the job. I&#8217;m the one that has to flip the bill and figure out how I&#8217;m going to proceed and how I&#8217;m going to recover from such an event. So just the very basic labor protections.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HD:</strong> I can imagine how hard that is for someone who&#8217;s just trying to live life. They really don&#8217;t pay for the bill?</p>



<p><strong>WS:</strong> No, they don&#8217;t pay for anything. So at the end of the day, we&#8217;re the ones that are exposed, and overnight our lives can be changed. And that&#8217;s the whole issue with the gig work is that we&#8217;re the ones that are being left exposed. If anything happens to us,&nbsp; it&#8217;s on us. So, I think it&#8217;s really important for workers to organize around very basic labor protections because at the end of the day we don&#8217;t have any protections at all.</p>



<p><strong>HD: Okay, how can they do it? How can they organize and get these labor protections?</strong></p>



<p><strong>WS:</strong> At the very basic level is going to have to be worker-led. Workers are the ones that are being aggrieved and taken advantage of. So, nobody is better to speak to the issues that we face other than ourselves. Workers leading each other is the way to go.</p>



<p><strong>HD:</strong> <strong>What do you think workers can win in tech by organizing? What&#8217;s the goal?</strong></p>



<p><strong>WS:</strong> The establishment of basic labor protections because for our industry right now in gig work, we don&#8217;t have any basic protections because of how gig companies have been classifying us. So, because we&#8217;re being misclassified as independent contractors instead of employees we don&#8217;t have any work protections. We can win basic labor protections if we come together and organize.</p>



<p><strong>HD:</strong> That&#8217;s huge–the misclassification of workers. What are some problems you ran into besides labor protections that you have to deal with because you have been misclassified as a contract worker instead of an employee?</p>



<p><strong>WS:</strong> Well, our pay. To meet the minimum wage floor, we have to be in a situation where the gig companies can pay us whatever they want and however they want because we don’t have any wage protections or wage floor.</p>



<p><strong>HD: What do you think is the connection between the people who work in corporate jobs? You know the white collar jobs when it comes to this industry? How do you see that connection?</strong></p>



<p><strong>WS: </strong>I don’t see it at all. I think there is a big disconnect between what the office worker does and what we do. I just don’t see the connection at all.</p>



<p><strong>HD: What would you like to see from the people who work in office jobs? You mentioned there&#8217;s a disconnect, how should they connect to you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>WS:</strong> How do I respond to that? I think that they need to stand up for what&#8217;s morally correct or morally right. Right now, AI technology is being used against workers, and in a way that is very exploitative. And those people in those office buildings are the ones writing those codes. It&#8217;s really important that they stand up for what&#8217;s right and not allow the companies to write such code without any rebuttals of what kind of protection, and what kind of rights people have that are being affected by the technology that is being built.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the pandemic, tech workers have reached out to Collective Action in Tech asking for advice and guidance on how to organize in workplaces that are increasingly remote-first. How do we build relationships over zoom? What does outreach look like when we haven’t met our coworkers in real life? How can our remote office tools work to our advantage when organizing a campaign? While the answer to these questions may differ from workplace to workplace, we’ve seen a variety of best practices across campaigns when it comes to remote organizing. DM’s Open aims to encapsulate some of these learnings and is the result of many conversations with tech workers and other remote workers over the past 2+ years, during a whirlwind period of new and intensified organizing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><em><em><mark style="background-color:#ffffff" class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Hyatt Dirbas spoke with Shay Culpepper, senior software engineer and member of the Times Tech Guild about unionizing the workplace within tech.</mark></em></em></em> <em>On March 3rd</em>, <em>the Guild won their NLRB election with an 80% majority. </em></p>



<p><strong>HD: Who should be organizing in tech?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC: </strong>Everyone should be organizing in tech. It&#8217;s easy to look at big famous companies and think tech workers are treated well, but many tech workers are not. They’re consultants in less-than-ideal situations. Even tech workers like <a href="https://kickstarterunited.org/">Kickstarter</a>, [who are at] B-corps, or ones that want to make a difference are getting paid less because they are going to feel good about working at that company. At <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The [New York] Times</a>, it&#8217;s lovingly referred to as the “mission discount”. It&#8217;s not unattractive and there are a lot of people who&#8217;ve been willing to accept less. However, they are for-profit companies, so why should you have to accept less because it makes you feel good? You also have people working at startups, where it&#8217;s exploitative a lot of times too. People are having to work 70-80 hours a week and they&#8217;re getting paid in RSUs (Restricted Stock Unit) that may or may not ever materialize because it&#8217;s a startup and who knows what value that is going to show up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HD: What’s an RSU (Restricted Stock Unit)?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC:</strong> Restricted stock unit. It&#8217;s similar to equity in the company. A lot of tech jobs include some kind of equity. It&#8217;s good if you&#8217;re contributing so much and if the value of the company is going up because you want to take a share in that when you’ve worked in it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HD: Do you think that RSUs are worth it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC</strong>:&nbsp; Well, with startups, it&#8217;s a gamble every single time because you have very little long-term security if you&#8217;re working for a startup. For example, I know a lot of start-ups shuttered when the pandemic hit. What protections do those workers in start-ups have whereas if you had protections in a contract beforehand? In larger companies, the company can prepare in case something like that happens. With startups, there&#8217;s just no preparation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HD:&nbsp; What should they be organizing around?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC:</strong>&nbsp; This is dependent on the place. I don&#8217;t think this is true at The New York Times, but there are lots of tech companies doing sketchy things. That’s when there are great opportunities for workers to say I don&#8217;t have to work on something that I&#8217;m ethically opposed to and put it in your contract. The Google Union (<a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/">Alphabet Workers Union</a>) is centered a lot around this including people getting fired for unethical or disturbing reasons. In 2018, before the union effort for them started, they had a walkout with thousands of people because of an executive [Andy Rubin] that got a golden parachute and lots of money [$90 million] on the way out after a sexual harassment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html">claim</a>. As you can see, it is a little different for every place, but ultimately, it&#8217;s the same. It&#8217;s equity amongst workers. It’s about diversity and making it a welcoming place for people. It’s about fair salaries and being paid what you&#8217;re worth. It’s about fair protections. It’s about having health care that will take care of you at the moment that you need it. All things accessibility are important. That&#8217;s one thing that there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity for and where it gets so much bigger than just our unions in a single workplace. It&#8217;s for the benefit of the world if tech workers don&#8217;t want to work on a particular technology because it&#8217;s sketchy or unethical.</p>



<p><strong>HD: How can these people organize?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC</strong>: The most important thing is talking to your coworkers. These collective actions seem like somebody yelled out “let&#8217;s strike!” and then everybody came because they all believed in it. In reality, this happens through close relationships between coworkers. You must build those relationships and spaces where people can talk to one another. Once you start talking to one another, you start to see systemic problems because you only know the problems on your team and maybe the org above. Usually, the only way you start to know stuff that&#8217;s happening elsewhere is when you start talking to people that are in totally different parts of the organization and how policies are affecting them differently than they&#8217;re affecting you and how managers are treating people differently between those two places and things like that. So, those relationships are vital. Our organizing committee is 10% of the unit. At any given time, there are anywhere between 45 and 60 people on the organizing committee. The main job when you sign up for the organizing committee is having one-on-ones with people. Like you&#8217;re a point person for someone. You meet every two weeks to figure out what&#8217;s going on, have the feel about things, keep them in the loop and build a relationship. I usually do 20 minutes of talking about what we want and then I&#8217;ll do like a 10-minute union conversation. All of a sudden you have spaces where if somebody wants to advance or ask for a raise, they can talk to somebody about that. The community propels the movement because when you say, we have strength among us, we can move this forward. It’s important to have that trust and trust in your coworkers. So that&#8217;s huge. Those relationships are everything that&#8217;s how you&#8217;re going to get there.</p>



<p><strong>HD: That is a big starting point.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC: </strong>Yeah. Developing those spaces is important. We have a Slack space that is completely separate from our company Slack. Everybody uses personal email addresses. The company has no insight into it. We asked people not to open it on their work computers so that there is no way they can spy on that space. People can say if they got a raise and how much it was or if they got a promotion and what they are making now. It allows us to know what to expect If we&#8217;re getting a raise, or what to ask for if you&#8217;re getting underpaid because you’ll know what other people are making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HD: &nbsp;Sharing your salaries– I think that&#8217;s huge because nobody knows.</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a great space and what that did for us is even for people that don&#8217;t want a union, this effort has been positive and has had a positive impact in our workplace. So, they&#8217;re not resentful of the movement itself and that solidarity is still there. That’s how you do it. You do it by having conversations with each other, helping each other in your careers. You know looking out for each other in the workplace. Relationships are community.</p>



<p><strong>HD: I want to circle back, you said there’s no resentment between those who want a union and those who don’t in the workplace?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC: </strong>I know of a couple of people who do not want an actual union with full-on rights and everything. They are colleagues that we respect and people we love whom we spend lots of time and have good relationships with. Things like the salary sharing channel, in particular, they have cited as a good thing in our workplace, that we have this community space. It brings goodwill when you&#8217;re able to create those spaces where people are supporting each other, even if somebody doesn&#8217;t want a full union.</p>



<p><strong>HD:&nbsp; So, even if you can&#8217;t create a full union, even by doing these steps, getting to know each other and talking to your co-workers it&#8217;s still beneficial?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC:</strong> Absolutely. Yes, you can start making changes now before you have a majority. We&#8217;ve been able to have things change before we had a majority supporting the union because we&#8217;re talking to each other. The other thing is if it&#8217;s born of community and not just like rabble-rousing, you&#8217;re more likely to have good relationships with skeptical people. This is important because when you get into bargaining you are bargaining for them too. You want their interests represented and you don&#8217;t want them to be so resentful towards the union.</p>



<p>Kickstarter had a good example of this. I&#8217;ve been told this multiple times, by people from Kickstarter that there was somebody who was very anti-union during that campaign who ended up being like one of the best people on the bargaining committee and contributing all the time. I love that story.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>HD: What can labor win in tech?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>SC</strong>:&nbsp; Some individuals at the New York Times have gotten raises. Another thing that&#8217;s happened and it was a long time coming was bringing down the level at which you could qualify for RSUs. So, we were suddenly given RSUs, which we had never had before for a lower-level employees. Last summer our newsroom also won a generous parental policy leave that got rolled out to the whole company.</p>



<p>They also started having conversations about on-call pay once we went public. That was one of the things we cited as a reason for unionizing because we don&#8217;t have any on-call pay but everyone&#8217;s sort of expected to be on-call at different times. There&#8217;s not even a policy where if you were on-call last night and something happened that you could take tomorrow off. You still must work your full 35 hours on top of whatever you did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We really won because we proved that you need to have the union to get them to move on these things at all. Even if we don&#8217;t have a union, there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s going to come quickly that the company already wants to fix because they know it&#8217;s something we want, and they don&#8217;t want to give us any more fodder. It&#8217;s really powerful. We have 600 people in our unit so we are building a lot of relationships to make that work.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"></h1>



<p></p>



<p><em>2021 was </em><a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2022/2021-a-year-of-resilience-in-tech/"><em>a year with unprecedented levels of collective actions</em></a><em>, especially unionization, in the tech field. Wynnie Chan spoke with Sunday Mills, one of the union organizers at Google Pittsburgh vendor company HCL about the state of organizing in tech.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: Who do you think should be organizing in tech?</em></strong></p>



<p>SM: Everyone. But, contract, temp, and vendor workers really need extra protections. Most big tech firms have some sort of bifurcated system, where some employees are permanent salaried employees who work directly for the company, but other workers are not employed by the given tech firm and are employed by some other entity. Those other workers typically have a lot more limited rights. They&#8217;re paid less. Their benefits are worse. They don&#8217;t have job security. They often end up signing non-compete or arbitration agreements that are sneaky. People like me&#8211; temps, vendors, and contractors&#8211; might be people who are already more vulnerable. Older folks, people fresh out of school, people who need flexible hours because they&#8217;re still going to school, or people who have to worry about child care or need to work remotely because they&#8217;re immunocompromised in the pandemic. These workers might already be at a high risk for being manipulated and having their rights be taken advantage of by a big corporation, and their position as a temp or contractor really increases that.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em><strong>WC: What should workers be organizing about?</strong> </em></strong></p>



<p>SM: Equitable pay for equitable work is the biggest one, but the only way to solve that is to stop these dual employment situations, or these quasi-dual employment situations. The only reason that they exist in the first place is to save the company who&#8217;s hiring the contracting firm money. It&#8217;s very difficult when these situations exist because we are only permitted to bargain with our direct employers and not with any larger firm who might be causing the direct employer to do certain things.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of legal protections that workers like me often don&#8217;t get. A lot of the time, these employment agreements are long and complicated, and nobody gets any support from the company about them. These are the non-sexy issues that nobody really wants to talk about. But these issues, like forced arbitration, dual employment, non-compete, all of the NLRA (National Labor Relations Act) heavy issues are things that I think are really important. And at least in our unit, once they knew about these problems and had them explained in a way that was applicable to their lives, they did care about them. But this was the first time that anybody had been explaining why these agreements were problematic, why this could be dangerous. There’s an assumption that tech workers somehow automatically will be more educated on labor law because they work with computers, or they&#8217;re the tech savvy or business savvy people. But that&#8217;s not really the case.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: I thought that was really interesting how you brought up that lots of workers don&#8217;t get the support they need to understand these contracts. How can we best support workers in terms of understanding the contracts?</em></strong></p>



<p>SM: Our <a href="https://www.usw.org/">USW</a> lawyers and organizers looked over our agreement with our employer. That really helped us understand those issues, and obviously it was something that was heavily scrutinized in bargaining. But, for groups of workers who aren&#8217;t near that process at all yet, I don&#8217;t know. I could imagine some sort of workshop where people could ask, “Okay, my agreement says this. Could somebody explain that to me?” With a labor lawyer or somebody who&#8217;d be willing to sit with people and talk through it with them. I think that could be helpful in just identifying the issues that people care about, because a lot of the time, it&#8217;s hard to know what rights they already do and do not have and what they&#8217;d like to see improved.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em><strong>WC: How can workers organize in tech</strong>?</em></strong></p>



<p>SM: The nice thing about working in tech is that you&#8217;re always on a computer. There&#8217;s a lot of caveats with that; in the organizing phase, you&#8217;re never going to want to use work machines to make union communications. But the benefit is that a lot of these people already have some fundamental tech knowledge and they tend to know how to use tools like Microsoft Teams, G-Suite or Zoom. That can be helpful, because getting people to show up at these virtual events in the pandemic can be really difficult. And if somebody already knows how to do it, that&#8217;s one less barrier to them showing up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For our union, we use the entire Google Suite of products because those are the products we use at work. So, we could be sure that everybody knows how to look at our calendar and subscribe to our events, etc. Now that we’re in a pandemic, online organizing is a great time to reach out to tech workers because these are some of the only people that we can reach out to right now in a really effective way. There&#8217;s so many barriers for other groups.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: What can labor win in tech?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>SM: A lot. We won so much, and we signed our contract at a point when it felt like it was never going to be over. We had been bargaining for 2 and a half years. We kept stalling on the same issues. We were up against these megaliths, Google and HCL. HCL is a 10 billion dollar company. It&#8217;s one of the largest tech firms globally and one of the biggest corporations in India. We were up against 2 huge corporations, and it was just feeling so hopeless.</p>



<p>But we won a lot. We ended forced arbitration. We got promised raises for the 3 year duration of our contract that in some cases are nearly 10 times the raises we got before. We used to have a $30,000 pay gap for the same title in our unit, and we&#8217;ve narrowed that down. We created a minimum salary limit without decreasing anybody else&#8217;s salary. So we closed that gap. What else did we get? We got a promise of equivalent benefits for the next 3 years, so they can&#8217;t pull our health insurance out from under us. We got more leave time, more sick days &#8212; we didn&#8217;t have any sick days before. Just so much. The same things that you can win anywhere, you can win in tech. There are lots of units winning in tech now. They&#8217;re winning all sorts of the exact same protections that any worker needs. It&#8217;s all possible.</p>

<p></p>



<p><em><em>Wynnie Chan spoke with Chris Smalls, one of the leaders of the Amazon Labor Union a couple months before their historic victory. </em></em></p>



<p><strong>WC: How do you think unions can best counter Amazon’s anti-union messages or actions?</strong></p>



<p>CS: We have to organize the workers. The workers have to pretty much organize themselves. There’s only so much a third party establishment can do on the outside. But the way we’re doing it, we have workers on the inside who are currently working there that are the key vital piece to countering the anti-union tactics. They&#8217;re able to see exactly what&#8217;s going on here, what&#8217;s going on in real time, and that gives us the opportunity to strategize around that. So building the Workers’ Committee, building strong solidarity within the work environment, that&#8217;s the only way to really counter it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WC: Given that ALU is an independent union, did you all ever consider working with national unions in your strategy, or did you just know from the start that this should be an independent movement?</strong></p>



<p>CS: We never considered that. Of course, we stand in solidarity with the unions that are also organizing at Amazon. But the reason why we chose to go about this route is because we saw what happened with the last campaign in Alabama. We saw that Amazon was using the fact that they&#8217;re not inside the building, they don&#8217;t know the ins and outs, against them. And they&#8217;re not able to debunk a lot of the things that Amazon uses to get Amazon workers to not sign up. So what we&#8217;re doing at Staten Island is that we have organizers on the inside that can debunk anything that Amazon is spinning towards the workers. Instead of letting things linger and grow, we try to nip it in the bud, and we try to really get ahead of it. It helps our campaign to go from the inside-out instead of the outside-in.</p>



<p><strong>WC: What other methods do you think were especially effective in convincing workers to unionize?</strong></p>



<p>CS: The creativity of our strategies. The way we organize is not traditional. We&#8217;re more out in the open. We&#8217;re more transparent. I think that resonates with the workers when they see that their coworkers are speaking out in public spaces, and it really encourages the other workers to speak up as well. So we’re using a snowball effect, where we started a Workers’ Committee that&#8217;s really vocal and upfront. And now, we&#8217;re at a point in our campaign where workers are finally realizing that they&#8217;re doing this for a reason. We just have to wait until the workers are ready to really get on board. It can take time. They have to break out of their shell. We never know when they may come out. It could be 3 months into the campaign, 3 weeks into the campaign. We never would know.</p>



<p><strong>WC: Do you have any key takeaways for future unionization efforts?</strong></p>



<p>CS: The best advice I can offer is to make sure that you keep the workers in the driver’s seat. A lot of unions will want to help out, and politicians and politics get involved, and they lose the interest of the workers. The most important thing is to make sure that the workers&#8217; voices are heard. Make sure that they feel empowered and make sure that they are supported in every way.</p>



<p><strong>WC: Right, I remember reading how you said in Bessemer, bringing in politicians wasn&#8217;t exactly the best move because workers couldn&#8217;t resonate with them as well.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>CS: Workers at Amazon have 12 hour shifts and could have two and a half hour commutes. They don&#8217;t come home and turn on the news. They don&#8217;t come home and get on Twitter. They don&#8217;t see any of these things that we see on the outside, because they have family to take care of, and they have to go back to work. So, bringing in politicians and celebrities is only going to go so far. You have to make sure that the workers are organizing themselves.</p>



<p><strong>WC: Besides being an independent union, how are your unionization efforts different from previous attempts?</strong></p>



<p>CS: In 27 years of existence, I don&#8217;t think we have ever seen a campaign quite like the one we have. We have a mixture of Gen Z, Gen X organizers that are using social media. We&#8217;re using things like TikTok. The things that we&#8217;re using to reach the masses are completely 21st century, and that&#8217;s the difference compared to the 1900s and 1930s. They didn&#8217;t have all these tools that we have. We’re utilizing these tools and utilizing the media and being creative.</p>



<p><strong>WC: Speaking of the media, all of these Amazon efforts have been heavily covered by the media. How has that shaped or influenced the campaign?</strong></p>



<p>CS: Not much. The media is going to do what they want to do. We try to control the narrative by, once again, putting a lot of workers in interviews or putting them in a position to be interviewed, so they can tell their stories. But also, when it comes to bad publicity, that can also be a gift and a curse. Us withdrawing from our petition the first time around, that hurt us. So we had to make sure that we stayed grounded and got back to our basics, and our basics don’t include media. It’s just organizers doing exactly what they were doing from Day 1. And then, we pretty much strategized a creative way to get the momentum back on our side. And the fact is, we did stay resilient, and it put us in a position to refile again within a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WC: How would you best bring morale back and stay resilient? Especially since these processes take a very long time.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>CS: I remind everybody that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Along this campaign, there&#8217;s going to be small victories. There&#8217;s going to be small losses. We have to take them as they come. We build off the victories, and we learn from our mistakes. That&#8217;s the only way we can continue the longevity of this campaign. The reality is, not every day may be a good day.&nbsp; We had days where we would sign maybe one or two people up. But then, there&#8217;s days where we&#8217;ll sign 150 people. So you never know what the day may bring. You have to keep being resilient and consistent.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WC: Definitely. And I like how you mentioned something about building off the victories and learning from the mistakes. Could you expand on that, what do you think went right and what<s> </s>have you learned?</strong></p>



<p>CS: We definitely learned a lot. We should have made our TikTok profile months ago, because it helped us with a lot of donations. Had we known, we probably would have started it Day 1. But that’s a growing pain. We&#8217;re still learning every single day. We have to learn something new every day, and if you have that mindset, when things do happen, you&#8217;ll have more options to use because you&#8217;re already thinking about it. I also realized that as a leader I have to try to stay 2 steps ahead of Amazon. That sounds crazy. But that&#8217;s exactly what I think about every single day when I wake up.</p>



<p><strong>WC: I see, it’s difficult but it&#8217;s what you need to do, especially given their funds and resources. Did you have any prior experience in organizing or leadership? How prepared did you feel?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>CS: No, it&#8217;s funny. I wasn’t an organizer before I was terminated. But, Amazon pretty much prepared me for it. I was at the company for four and a half years. I&#8217;m a leader, just on a different team. So the principles that I learned at Amazon are actually the principles that I apply to organizing. Once again, I’m still new to organizing a union, but if you have leadership principles that you follow, it&#8217;s not that difficult to do what we’re doing. You just got to apply yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>WC: Do you have any advice or words of encouragement for other workers who might feel reluctant, or they&#8217;re afraid to start the process of union organizing or make the call to a union?</strong></p>



<p>CS: Yeah, the time is now. Don&#8217;t just quit your job. A lot of people are like, “You don’t like the job, just quit.” But that doesn&#8217;t change the system. Some people that I talk to out here are like, “Oh, well, I&#8217;m not gonna be here that long.” I tell them to sign it for the next person. Because the next person will be doing what you&#8217;re doing, and you&#8217;re going through a tough time. Why would you want that person to go through the same thing?</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"></h1>



<p></p>



<p><em><em>2021 was </em><a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2022/2021-a-year-of-resilience-in-tech/"><em>a year with unprecedented levels of collective actions</em></a><em>, especially unionization, in the tech field. Wynnie Chan spoke with Toy Vano, one of the organizers of </em><a href="https://kickstarterunited.org/"><em>Kickstarter United</em></a><em> about the state of organizing in tech, 2 years after its historic vote to unionize. She is currently a Tech Organizer at OPEIU Local 1010.</em></em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: Who do you think should be organizing in tech?</em></strong></p>



<p>TV: My short answer is everyone. A longer answer would be that the majority of tech companies are made up of a variety of disciplines and departments and skill sets of people who work together towards building a single product. Likewise, the strongest movements are built on cross departmental solidarity, specifically ones that center the voices of people who are the most marginalized workers. And I&#8217;m not talking just about product teams of engineers or product managers, designers, business analysts, people like that. I mean, everyone. From entry level customer service reps to data entry, to your most privileged senior engineer.</p>



<p>The more cross departmental solidarity that you can build in tech, the stronger the movement itself will be, which is one of the reasons why the <a href="https://nytimesguild.org/">New York Times Tech Guild</a>’s <a href="https://nyguild.org/front-page-details/nlrb-sets-nyt-tech-guild-election-rejects-attempts-to-exclude-workers">recent NLRB hearings</a> were so important, because the NLRB ruled in favor of all of these different departments and titles being included under one unit.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: How do you think we can best create that cross departmental solidarity?</em></strong></p>



<p>TV: Talking to people and sharing experiences. And I know that it can be challenging for folks who don&#8217;t necessarily work with each other, day to day, or interact in those types of environments, but I think making extra effort to understand each and every person or colleagues’ like experience at work really helps build empathy.</p>



<p>You have to make a conscious effort to do it. It&#8217;s not going to come organically, and that&#8217;s the hard part about organizing. People are like, “This feels so forced.” But it is. It&#8217;s work. You have to put effort into making these types of things, building these types of communities. Just having one-on-one conversations with people, asking them how their work is going, and listening to what they say. Oftentimes, people forget that organizing is conversation, but one-on-ones are the most important part of organizing, and that is something that you cannot take for granted. An email to a group of people is going to have way less effect than you going and talking to a person face to face, and just being like, “Hey, this is what&#8217;s going on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: With the pandemic, it’s harder to have these face-to-face conversations, because many people are working from home. So, how can union organizers bridge this gap and still maintain solidarity and communication?</em></strong></p>



<p>TV: I&#8217;m not gonna say that it hasn&#8217;t been really tough. However, we’ve still seen an uptick in organizing during the pandemic. So, it&#8217;s not impossible. People have Zoom fatigue, but the process of the invite is very much the same. The more organic conversations that you would have over a Happy Hour after work probably won&#8217;t happen as often, but you just have to be a lot more intentional, and be like, “Hey, you got five minutes to chat after work? Can I call you?” And you just have to be a lot more explicit about those types of things. It&#8217;s hit or miss. What a lot of people are finding is that besides the intentional department siloing thing that companies do, for folks who have switched jobs during the pandemic, it&#8217;s been especially hard because it&#8217;s like, “Hey, I don&#8217;t actually know anybody that I work with, because I see the same seven people, and maybe when we have an all hands, there&#8217;s a bunch of faces on the screen but I have no idea who these people are.”&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: What should they be organizing around?</em></strong></p>



<p>TV: What <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> they be organizing around? I think the tech industry is so unchecked in its power, and it has gone unchecked for a long time. Now, we&#8217;re starting to really see what that looks like, with unconscionable amounts of wealth being very concentrated to a handful of people, while their workers need food assistance and things like that. That alone should make you want to flip a table.</p>



<p>The most immediate and personal issues are probably around inequity within the workplace. Now that I’m an organizer with <a href="https://www.opeiu.org/">OPEIU</a>, I get to work with a lot of different campaigns. Something we’ve seen only exacerbated by the conditions surrounding the pandemic is the return-to-office policies disproportionately affecting parents and caregivers, disabled workers, or other workers who have a hard time or traditionally have a harder time with the expense, or the logistics of coming into an office every day. So I think those inequities are kind of on blast right now, with regards to the pandemic having really amplified that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also a massive elephant in the room of tech companies perpetuating white supremacy culture and not being willing to actually reckon with that fact. So, what they do instead is kind of gloss over it with these employee powered ERGs, and I specifically use the word powered because typically these are unpaid people doing the emotional labor of work to educate often white and privileged colleagues about what this means. But these ERGs&#8211; and I am not dissing on them at all&#8211; but my point is that they, more often than not, don&#8217;t actually have the power, or they&#8217;re restricted from making or taking action on decisions that result in any legitimate or lasting change at their companies. And those changes would specifically benefit BIPOC and LGBTQI communities at those companies. So I think that is a huge thing to be organizing around specifically.</p>



<p>The labor workforce in tech is really in a great, unique position of power right now to finally check the ethical decision making of companies whose decisions affect everyone globally. This is in regards to personal privacy, human rights, and climate change. And tech is so ingrained in every single thing we do. So, if we continue to allow these tech giants and companies in power to operate ethically unchecked, we&#8217;re just going to continue to see a snowball of detrimental effects of that power that will continue to build up across the board.</p>



<p>When I started organizing at Kickstarter, the idea of a union in a tech company was just really exciting to me. I&#8217;ve worked in tech for a decade, but now that I&#8217;ve worked in tech from an organizing perspective as well, I don&#8217;t think that the traditional view of tech workers is necessarily true, that tech workers are typically well paid. It&#8217;s only one part of the tech industry that&#8217;s actually well-paid and privileged, when in reality it&#8217;s a very tiered system.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s just a lot of potential for folks to stand up and actually use that power. I mean, we&#8217;re seeing labor shortages. That is power. We have the upper hand right now. Companies are hemorrhaging positions and turnover rates are super high, and that&#8217;s expensive for them. By bonding together and collectively moving as a unit, that is so powerful. Our labor is our most valuable bargaining chip, and I think that&#8217;s really what we should be working towards, to make sure that everyone realizes that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I know that everything I said is very idealistic, and that not every single person that works in tech would be moved by those types of things. Because I see that every day. Privilege does breed apathy oftentimes, and so the questions that I always want to ask those folks are like, what do you like about your job that you don&#8217;t want to lose? And how much power do you alone have to protect what you don&#8217;t want to lose? Those types of questions help frame it. And collective action doesn&#8217;t have to be against a negative. It can be to protect the positives, but it’s also done together. You probably can&#8217;t do this by yourself. If you or any one person asks for this, it’s less likely to happen then if all of us stand up together for it.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong><em>WC: What can labor win in tech?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>TV: The sky’s the limit right now. We’re only just getting started. I don’t think we actually know where the ceiling is for this and personally, I don’t want to limit us to something, but we’re already seeing 4 day work weeks and percentage of representation on the board and those types of things. </p>



<p>We could really accomplish a lot by using collective power to put pressure on upper management and these companies. And similar to what I mentioned, what do we think we can do based on diversity? How much can we actually achieve when we start to think about checking the ethics of tech? Where can we go, because you see workers already banding together against the types of contracts that they get at their companies. These are huge. That in itself is like, “We&#8217;re all already going to work,” and thinking, “Ugh, just another day at work.” But, when you&#8217;re going to work and you know that what you&#8217;re working towards is detrimental to society as a whole, you can take a stand and say, “We can change this. That&#8217;s what we can change.” Labor can change what we work on. We have the power to withhold our labor, and it’s so beautiful to see when workers figure out or come together to organize around these issues that are just racist and capitalist, most of the time.</p>



<p>What really draws me to this movement is that I genuinely see labor as being able to solve a lot of the issues that we have.</p>



<p>Our workplaces and our work can really blur lines in a way that politics never really did before. It’s diversely unifying as well. We have so much more in common when we really think about the types of ways that our labor is exploited or used, and that&#8217;s one of the most beautiful parts of the labor movement, especially in tech. I&#8217;m starting to see a shift in the way the workers are thinking about their work. And it&#8217;s not just like, “Oh, I&#8217;m just gonna go work on the thing!” Oh no, I&#8217;m going to <em>really</em> think about things that are happening in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every year, we see new things as possible. We just have to realize our power. One of my colleagues who works with me at <a href="https://www.techworkersunion-1010.org/about-us">Local 1010</a> was also a colleague of mine at Kickstarter. Their name is RV, and I specifically remember the moment that RV and I were on a one-on-one. I was already involved. They were checking in on me, because that&#8217;s important too in these types of communities, taking care of each other. And then at some point, RV turned to me and said, ‘When did you realize your power?’ And, and I’m like, “What??” But it&#8217;s true, and that is the thing, we each have power and collectively, it is so strong, and I&#8217;ve never forgotten that moment. I know exactly where I was when they said that to me, and I kind of wanted to turn to them. “It&#8217;s like, now??”</p>



<p>I think that that&#8217;s really beautiful. Part of this is reminding each other that we have power. That&#8217;s the center of it all.</p>
