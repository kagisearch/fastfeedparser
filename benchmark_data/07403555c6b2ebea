					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.loudandquiet.com/short/20-years-of-loud-and-quiet-and-time-for-something-new/"><![CDATA[<p>The independent music industry is full of music fans who started something and learnt on the job. Bands, of course, but also labels, websites, promoters, management, and, in my case, a printed fanzine that became a magazine, which then needed to have its own website. Naturally, the website then needed its own podcast.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years <em>Loud And Quiet</em> has picked up and put down: club nights, gig promotion, questionable merchandise, a Japanese edition, New York distribution and a cassette and vinyl record label. A year ago it also put down the very heart of what it is: the print title. <a href="https://www.loudandquiet.com/short/why-has-there-only-been-one-edition-of-loud-and-quiet-magazine-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.loudandquiet.com/short/why-has-there-only-been-one-edition-of-loud-and-quiet-magazine-this-year/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1740474638456000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1JRg1bBQuaOTJszwf1ohO9">I updated readers on our position 8 months later</a>, explaining that a break had been needed whilst we worked on an extended series of our <a href="https://www.loudandquiet.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.loudandquiet.com/podcasts/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1740474638456000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3s8FqPZ5UyqAygIY0Iis86">Midnight Chats podcast</a>, which remains suspiciously unrecognised by all podcast awards.</p>
<p>As I wrote in that article, I always thought that if the physical magazine became untenable, that would be the end of L&amp;Q: I’ve never fancied the struggles of chasing eyes around the vastness of the internet, however much people would ask, “couldn’t you just do it as a website?”. But after a lot of thinking – and a lot of talking to readers, bands and the labels that release them – I’ve got something for you. A new beginning.</p>
<p>Starting from tomorrow (25 Feb) I will be moving <em>Loud And Quiet </em>onto <a href="https://loudandquiet.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://loudandquiet.substack.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1740474638456000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Kfh74rjsxpjlZbwQak_aa">Substack</a>, with a vision of how we can write about new music – and deliver artists’ stories to our readers and listeners – in a new way. This will be a quality-over-quantity operation, focussing on long-form writing and podcasts: album reviews that will read like artist features, cover-style artist interviews, essays and columns on how music affects our lives.</p>
<p>It will be very clever and essential reading. And a bit of a laugh.</p>
<p>In the busiest of weeks, subscribers will receive a <em>maximum</em> of 5 articles/podcasts from us; one per day, Monday to Friday. They’ll drop straight into your inbox (meaning neither you nor I need to concern ourselves so much with social media algorithms), although you’ll also be able to access all content <a href="https://loudandquiet.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://loudandquiet.substack.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1740474638456000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Kfh74rjsxpjlZbwQak_aa">via the Loud And Quiet Substack homepage</a> and the Substack app.</p>
<p>One of those busy weeks might look something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Mon:</strong> Album review</p>
<p><strong>Tues:</strong> Artist interview</p>
<p><strong>Wed:</strong> Essay / Op-ed piece</p>
<p><strong>Thurs:</strong> Podcast / Column</p>
<p><strong>Fri:</strong> L&amp;Q Weekly roundup</p>
<p>(Please note that while I get things up and running, we’re likely to initially be delivering 3 articles per week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.)</p>
<p><a href="https://loudandquiet.substack.com/">SUBSCRIBE NOW</a></p>
<p>Just as Alan Partridge once said “It must not, repeat, NOT turn into an all-night rave!”, we cannot go back to a point where <em>Loud And Quiet</em> is scraping by and hanging in there.</p>
<p>Over the years I tried every tactic to sustainably fund the magazine. For a long time giving it away for free and attracting advertisers worked beautifully. But things changed: social media arrived, advertisers moved to Facebook’s marketing pinpoint accuracy. Spotify robbed independent labels and budgets for any advertising dwindled further. By the time we asked our readers for their support (during the Covid pandemic), it was too late. As overwhelming as the response was, with reader subscriptions keeping <em>L&amp;Q</em> going for another 3 years, we continued to post articles on our website for free, undermining our own plea for readers to buy into what we were doing. (It’s no coincident that print titles like <em>The Wire</em> and <em>Private Eye</em> are both in healthier places having rigidly stuck to their policy of not sharing their print articles online.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, please understand why all of our articles posted Monday to Thursday will be for paying subscribers only; Friday’s <em>Loud And Quiet Weekly</em> roundup newsletter will remain free for all.</p>
<p>So if you’ve missed the writing found in <em>Loud And Quiet</em> over the last year, please hit the subscribe button below and give this new format a go, from something dirt cheap like 96.153p per week. It’s not going to be exactly the same, but that’s kind of the point too. Time for a change. For <em>Loud And Quiet</em>, and for music writing in general. And just imagine the convenience of one piece of very clever and essential reading coming direct to you each day. Not too much, not too little.</p>
<p>Almost as important as signing up, please share this with your friends. One thing I’ve already learnt about Substack is that it’s a place that thrives on community and recommendations, a lot like the world of independent music. So if you like it please do pass it on and help us grow.</p>
<p>The first official article of this new era will be with you tomorrow, although there are already some recent posts available now for paying subscribers too:</p>

<p>To celebrate the fact, the next 100 people who subscribe will do so at 50% off – just 25 measly pounds for the entire year. Starting… now!</p>

<p>Before we take a little time off to work out what&#8217;s next for the show, Greg and Stu offer up a parting gift to get our listeners through the coming months, in the form a 2025 preview episode. Who will win big at the Grammy&#8217;s and Brits? How did Lana Del Rey sell out two nights at Wembley? Will Neil Young make it to Glastonbury? And seriously, has anyone worked out why Robbie Williams is a played by an ape in his biopic?</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve not spoken about it much just yet, but with Christmas here, what better time is there to sit down with Ollie and Louis from the band to discuss songs about cannibalism, Andy Warhol&#8217;s wig, how they feel these days about their biggest song, and what happens when one member of the band vito&#8217;s an idea and breaks the heart of the rest of the group.</p>

She also talks about scoring CBBC shows and safety for female artists and producers via a simple device making a difference.</p>
<p>Outside of our guest interview this week, Greg and Stu discuss how a punk band terrified America by performing on the Jimmy Kimmel show (and ponder what would happen if we had the same booking here on Graham Norton), and report on how Irish rap trio Kneecap took the UK government to court this week and won.</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.loudandquiet.com/short/charli-xcx-the-o2-london-28-november-2024-live-review/"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody is more deserving of mainstream success than <a href="https://www.loudandquiet.com/artist/charli-xcx/">Charli XCX</a>. For 18 years, she’s put in the hard yards, hammering the live circuit and steadily amassing a catalogue of weapons-grade party-starters that have consistently pushed the pop envelope forward. It took until 2022 for her to score her first number one album – with the unapologetically accessible </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crash – </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but 2024 will go down in history as the year the 32-year-old finally got her flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a phenomenon is the understatement of the century. Since its release back in June, it’s earned Charli Grammy and Mercury Prize nominations, a number one remix, viral TikTok trends and a prestigious spot hosting SNL. There was barely a brand this summer that didn’t flirt with the album’s basic Arial typeface and toxic green colourway, while the catch-all concept was co-opted for Kamala Harris’ ill-fated election campaign. When Collins Dictionary crowned ‘brat’ word of the year (definition: characterised by a confident, independent and hedonistic attitude) the entire western world shrugged, ‘Fair enough.’ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to see Charli finally headline The O2 feels like some long-overdue karma. It’s a sense clearly shared by tonight’s sell-out audience, large swathes of which teeter on the edge of utter hysteria throughout. Watching her stride out in front of the neon green curtain – all waist-length hair extensions, knee-high boots and wrap-around shades – you get the sense she’s been selling out arenas in her mind for years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright lazyload" src="https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-320x240.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-320x240.jpg 320w, https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-480x360.jpg 480w, https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-1280x960.jpg 1280w, https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-1440x1080.jpg 1440w, https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-1920x1440.jpg 1920w, https://www.loudandquiet.com/files/2024/11/IMG_6313-2560x1920.jpg 2560w" data-sizes="auto">In keeping with the album’s minimal aesthetic, it’s a bare-bones stage set-up, centred around a giant floor print that simply reads &#8216;GIRL&#8217;, a curtain drop to mark the encore to unveil the accompanying &#8216;PARTY&#8217;, and a rain shower at the end of the runway for the penultimate &#8216;Track 10&#8217; before a riotous finale of the chart hit that started it all in 2012, &#8216;I Love It&#8217;. Mostly, though, it&#8217;s a shit-tonne of strobes and a short perspex catwalk down which Charli regularly disappears, taking her roaming camera operator with her. Taking cues from Rosalia’s recent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motomami</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tour, her moves are performed straight to camera and relayed on the video screens. When the camera cuts to her boyfriend George Daniel performing the viral ‘Apple’ dance in the audience, or to her spitting on and licking the catwalk during ‘Guess’, it feels enjoyably chaotic despite being meticulously choreographed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As ever, Charli’s live persona is pure aggression, motivating the audience like a pissed-off personal trainer might with a “Are you fucking ready London!” here and a “Where’s my fucking bad girls at?” there. It’s the perfect vibe match for <a href="https://www.loudandquiet.com/artist/a-g-cook/">A. G. Cook</a>’s belligerent beats, which thud ominously through the PA system at barely-legal volumes. From ‘360’’s it-girl rap to ‘Von Dutch’’s hater-bating house, every song incites a word-perfect scream-along, with the exception of the tender SOPHIE tribute ‘So I’, which remains extremely moving. Indeed, SOPHIE’s legacy is interwoven throughout, from the airing of ‘Immaterial’ that ushers in Charli’s initial entrance to the riotous version of ‘Vroom Vroom’ that arrives in the encore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It proves a hyperactive homecoming, finding our self-styled 365 Party Girl racing through the hour-and-a-half set, zig-zagging seamlessly between standalone single ‘Spring Breakers’ and the Lorde remix of ‘Girl, So Confusing’, or from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movie-cut ‘Speed Drive’ to insecurity anthem ‘Sympathy Is A Knife’. For the encore she brings out Caroline Polachek to perform their shared remixes of ‘Everything Is Romantic’ and ‘Welcome To My Island’, swiftly followed by Robyn and Yung Lean who reprise their turns on the ‘360’ remix. Charli then gives Robyn the stage to perform ‘Dancing On My Own’ to a truly rapturous reception. Watching Charli, Shygirl and Yung Lean dance along ecstatically at the back of the stage, you feel a real sense of kinship with them as fellow fans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s moments like these that illustrate what’s so intoxicating about Charli, both a collaborator and a solo star. Alongside impeccable taste, she possesses the generosity and enthusiasm of a true music obsessive, hell-bent on sharing her findings rather than her gatekeeping or quibbling over billing for the sake of ego. And as a result of this seemingly boundless passion, every single pop fan can count themselves better off. Now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">brat.</span></p>

But how does 2025&#8217;s bill stand up, when did Coachella become so powerful, and was it Greg attending in 2012 with a hologram to Tupac that made all other celebrities want to go?</p>
<p>Away from our tales of the festival (Stuart has also been to Coachella, but with little affect on its popularity), on episode 159 of Midnight Chats we review the new surprise release from Kendrick Lamar and spare a thought for Drake at this difficult time. Kate Nash has become the latest musician to start an OnlyFans to fund her artistry. And what does the strange BBC Sound of 2025 poll tell us about public appetite for new music?</p>

Like a begrudging respect for Robbie Williams, sadly, it comes to us all. Perhaps that&#8217;s why Stuart has taken to asking our guests about the subject of the great beyond, which reminded us that there was a time when we asked a bunch of musicians what they thought was the perfect way to die, in a regular interview feature in <em>Loud And Quiet</em> magazine.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s podcast we revisit those answers from 2014 &#8211; 2017, make our case for SZA to have another go at Glastonbury, review new documentary <em>Boy Bands Forever</em>, unpack the new proposed levy that supports grassroots venues and, somewhat tragically, discuss the new song by Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
