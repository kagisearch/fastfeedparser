      <title>Finally, Programmable Money</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Scalability is a hot topic in the bitcoin world right now. The rising &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-total"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;number of btc transactions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt; keeps moving us toward the point in which transaction volume will become a problem for the network. The debate on whether to increase the maximum block size to combat this issue is ongoing -- more on that in Gavin Andresen’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;scalability roadmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt; and Hearn’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-capacity-cliff-586d1bf7715e"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;, among others. Decentralization is key for bitcoin, and one of the primary arguments against increasing block size is that it could lead to increased centralization of the network, where only certain nodes would be able to participate. Losing that trustless, distributed nature would be crippling to the protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Bitcoin allows multiple parties who lack trust in one another to transact digitally without needing a mutually trusted third-party arbiter, but when the additional layer of complexity related to time is introduced into the equation, this becomes challenging to do cryptographically. That’s why often the default solution is to look to a previously agreed upon third party to serve this function. In some instances though, if you need a third party, you’re not much better off than you were before the bitcoin protocol even came about. For those of us who would rather trust math than people, this isn’t ideal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Core developer Peter Todd has proposed a solution in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/finally-programmable-money&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From bitcoind to BitGoD:A Look at the Original Bitcoin Client and Where We’ve Gone Since</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/from-bitcoind-to-bitgod-a-look-at-the-original-bitcoin-client-an</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;When it was first created in 2009, the original bitcoin program had two variants. They are totally compatible, take the same command line arguments, and essentially perform the same functions. The main difference lies in how the user interacts with them - one, commonly known as ‘Bitcoin Core’, formerly known as ‘Bitcoin-QT’, has a graphical user interface (GUI), while the other, ‘bitcoind’, is headless and lacks a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;A Bit of Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;bitcoind is an abbreviation of bitcoin daemon (a program that runs in the background rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user). bitcoind was created to be compatible across various operating systems, and runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It’s written in C++ and is a multithreaded program, meaning that it can run multiple threads to handle concurrent operations without needing to run several copies of the program simultaneously. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Functionality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;As the original bitcoin client, bitcoind’s core function is to connect to the bitcoin network and assist with generating and storing private keys, sending payments using those keys, and providing information about transactions, private keys under management, network status, etc -- essentially all the core functionality of the bitcoin protocol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;As they’re described in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoind"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;bitcoind wiki&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;, the core functions are: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stellar, Bitcoin, and the Psychology of Trust</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The summer after my junior year of college, I landed an internship at a marine and reef conservation non-profit in LA. I was in school in Pennsylvania at the time, which meant I’d be jetting off to a city on the opposite side of the country where I knew exactly one person. I’ve always had a rather laissez-faire approach to travel, so it didn’t occur to me until about two weeks prior to my start date that I didn’t actually have a place to stay. I certainly would have been in good company had I ended up joining the ranks of Venice Beach’s homeless population for the summer, but I opted for a more mainstream approach and started scouring Craigslist. When I finally found an apartment that seemed suitable, I set up a Skype call with the woman who would be subletting it. She gave me a virtual, highly pixelated tour of the place, (which could have been literally anywhere) and in light of this rigorous analysis I wisely decided to wire her several thousand dollars as an advance on the apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I’d finished congratulating myself for being such an adult, it occurred to me to ask her how I’d be getting the keys to the place. “Oh, don’t worry!”, she said. “They’ll be under the flower pot on the porch”. Reassured in the way that only a naïve twenty year old could be, I packed my things and hopped on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short of using an escrow service which would have cost me a large chunk of the total amount, there wasn’t much I could’ve have done in the situation. I went with blind trust, hardly a solid foundation for a modern digital economy. Bitcoin has the potential to build a much more solid foundation, and that’s what makes it so revolutionary. Its value is not really that it’s an exceptional payments protocol : payments are only a small subset of the As Marc Andreessen put it, “Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/stellar-bitcoin-and-the-psychology-of-trust&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Care About Financial Privacy? HD Wallets Are Your Friend</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/care-about-financial-privacy-hd-wallets-are-your-friend</link>
      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/care-about-financial-privacy-hd-wallets-are-your-friend</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maintaining privacy of transactions is a key tenet in building a robust financial network. Despite all the media hype around Silk Road and the like, this is true even if you’re engaging only in perfectly licit behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the blockchain lies in its decentralized, open nature, but because of those very characteristics, specific actions need be taken to protect bitcoin transactions and balances from being exposed in undesirable ways. Users can inadvertently reveal sensitive information about themselves and their transaction history if they use a single address for all of their bitcoin activity, which is the default behavior of many wallets today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;When bitcoin addresses are used multiple times, transactions can be linked to one another, and if it becomes known who the participants were in any one such transaction, a large amount of that address’ transaction history can be exposed. For instance, say you work at a company that pays its employees in bitcoin. You would of course know the address that is generating the transaction that pays you, and because the blockchain is public, you could also see the other transactions that were broadcast to the network by that same address. This could allow you, or anyone else who knows the source address, to infer private information around colleagues’ compensation, company ledgers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations holding sizable amounts of bitcoin have good reason to avoid linking their addresses and transactions to their identity in a way that is visible to the general public, which could result in targeted theft attempts — or worse.Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32 (BIP 32), a specification for how to use cryptographic key derivation to manage multiple keypairs with a single secret key, helps reconcile privacy and security concerns. Hierarchical deterministic wallets (also known as HD wallets, but not to be confused with high definition!) offer increased privacy without adding to...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/care-about-financial-privacy-hd-wallets-are-your-friend&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Network Security and Proof of Work: Do We Need an Alternative?</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/network-security-and-proof-of-work-do-we-need-an-alternative</link>
      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/network-security-and-proof-of-work-do-we-need-an-alternative</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin protocol is designed using a proof of work mechanism, which determines who is permitted to sign the transactions that need to be verified. A proof of work (PoW) is a piece of data which is computationally difficult to achieve, meaning that it required a lot of either time or hashing power (or both) to find the solution, but it’s easy to verify that this work was actually completed. Bitcoin uses a proof of work algorithm called hashcash, which has been around a lot longer than bitcoin itself, and was created with the purpose of being an anti denial-of-service (DOS) measure. Hashcash is fairly versatile and can be implemented with a number of functions; bitcoin uses hashcash-SHA256^2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof of work consists in finding a target number that is below a certain target value, and in doing so the miner essentially “proves” that she performed a certain amount of “work” in trying various inputs. If I input a string into the SHA-256 hash function, there is no known way of determining what the output will be. Trial and error is the only way to find an input that will generate a hash that fits the desired criteria. In theory, you could nail it on the first try, but the probability of this happening is very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the current combined hashing power of the network, on average a solution is found every 10 minutes, at which point the block has been mined and the bitcoins are released as a reward. Every 2016 blocks, which ends up being approximately every two weeks, the algorithm moderates itself and either increases or decreases the difficulty of the problem. In practical terms, this means that it either increases or decreases the target value, so it’s easier or harder to find a value below it. This ensures a relatively smooth rate of release for newly mined bitcoins, and avoids flooding the market with coins at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter whether I am using a supercomputer or a laptop to do the proof of work, it’s simply that...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/network-security-and-proof-of-work-do-we-need-an-alternative&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why You Should Probably Be Using a Multi-Sig Wallet</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/why-you-should-probably-be-using-a-multi-sig-wallet</link>
      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/why-you-should-probably-be-using-a-multi-sig-wallet</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would say I’m generally a jovial person, but if I woke up and realized I’d lost 7,500 bitcoins, I would encourage the rest of the world to back away slowly without making any sudden movements. Fortunately for the public good this hasn’t happened to me, but it did happen to an unfortunate fellow named &lt;a href="http://www.coindesk.com/man-accidentally-sends-4m-bitcoins-landfill/"&gt;Jeremy Howells.&lt;/a&gt; He became semi notorious in the bitcoin community for accidentally disposing of his hard drive with the keys to all his bitcoins on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still in the early stages of bitcoin’s life cycle, and five years is like the blink of an eye in currency-years. There is a strong trend toward mass adoption (5 million wallets growing 8x year over year, according to Mary Meeker’s &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/gallery/mary-meeker-internet-trends/slide/19/"&gt;annual report&lt;/a&gt;), but we’re not there yet. As things currently stand, there’s a fundamental disconnect in usability and control. You can choose to keep your private keys yourself in what is known as a client-side wallet, or you can hand them over to another party which stores them for you in a web wallet. When you do the latter, you’re trusting that they are taking appropriate security measures, and keeping at least the majority of your bitcoins in&lt;a href="http://www.ariannasimpson.com/non-experts-guide-mt-gox-fiasco/"&gt;cold storage.&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately, Mt. Gox and other recent fiascos prove that this isn’t always the case, which is why the safest thing to do is probably to diversify your holdings by using a variety  of wallets so if one gets hacked, you don’t lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably like things to be easy; most people do.  Many users simply don’t want the headache of thinking about security, which is the appeal of a full-service solution that stores your private keys for you. The issue is problematic for more advanced or tech-savvy users, who generally want a heightened degree of security without...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/why-you-should-probably-be-using-a-multi-sig-wallet&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Is the US Finally Getting It Right?</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/is-the-us-finally-getting-it-right</link>
      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/is-the-us-finally-getting-it-right</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t usually feel like patting the Federal Reserve on the back, but today just might be an exception. Perhaps it’s the fact that I’ve come to &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; the government to screw up, or just the fact that I am endlessly fascinated with bitcoin’s potential, but I think there’s a great deal to feel good about in how the United States is approaching cryptocurrencies these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Elections Commission recently &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/08/federal-election-commission-approves-bitcoin-donations-to-political-committees/"&gt;approved bitcoin donations&lt;/a&gt; to political campaigns, and although the $100 contribution cap limits its utility, it’s an important first step. A number of &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/17/us-bitcoin-rules-idUSBREA4G08P20140517"&gt;US state regulators&lt;/a&gt; are working on writing regulation that provides some clarity on the rules surrounding virtual currency and related consumer protections. Even that slow-moving monolith affectionately known as the Federal Reserve is starting to &lt;a href="http://www.coindesk.com/federal-reserve-bitcoin-potential-boon-global-commerce/"&gt;form an opinion&lt;/a&gt; – and astoundingly, it’s not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a step back a from domestic politics to the current international landscape. Today, the US remains the uncontested world hegemon. India is the world’s largest democracy, and we’re up to our eyeballs in debt with China, but as far as both political power and national wealth, the United States is still unparalleled. We seem to be doing our best to relinquish that position, however – our education system leaves much to be desired, particularly in the crucial STEM fields. According to a number of &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/us-students-lag-around-average-on-international-science-math-and-reading-test/2013/12/02/2e510f26-5b92-11e3-a49b-90a0e156254b_story.html"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, American fifteen year olds lagged...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/is-the-us-finally-getting-it-right&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Game Theory, Assurance Contracts, and Crowdfunding with Bitcoin</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/game-theory-assurance-contracts-and-crowdfunding-with-bitcoin</link>
      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/game-theory-assurance-contracts-and-crowdfunding-with-bitcoin</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my majors in college was international politics, and among the course requirements were a number of classes on game theory. It was one of the most interesting parts of my coursework, but I am sure I wouldn’t have believed it if I’d been told that a few years later I’d be spending an afternoon, of my own volition, writing about using the Bitcoin protocol to create assurance contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;free rider problem&lt;/strong&gt; in game theory posits that there are situations in which the creation of a public good (for example, building a road) will provide utility to a group of people and leave everyone better off. However, if there is no way of excluding those who did not contribute, many will make the rational decision to not pay and yet still reap the benefits of others’ contributions. In some cases this means that the public good will not be created, and utility is lower for everyone. &lt;strong&gt;Assurance contracts &lt;/strong&gt;represent a way of solving the issue by ensuring that people actually contribute. In one of these binding contracts, a group of people agrees to fund a certain public good when a financial threshold is met. If the project is fully funded, the public good is provided, and if it is not, then the money is returned to those who pledged it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting twist is the ability to create &lt;a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/PrivateProvision.pdf"&gt;dominant assurance contracts&lt;/a&gt;. In game theory, a &lt;strong&gt;dominant strategy&lt;/strong&gt; is one that is the best course of action regardless of what the other actors in a scenario do. In an assurance contract situation, a dominant strategy would involve having the entrepreneur agree to pay a certain amount of money back to the contributors in the event the project wasn’t funded. Although this increases the risk for the entrepreneur, it also increases the probability the project will be funded. For the potential contributors, this setup ensures a win-win situation, where funding the...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/game-theory-assurance-contracts-and-crowdfunding-with-bitcoin&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What the IRS Ruling Actually Means for Bitcoin</title>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/what-the-irs-ruling-actually-means-for-bitcoin</link>
      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/what-the-irs-ruling-actually-means-for-bitcoin</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;There have been a lot of rumblings since the IRS ruling on bitcoin earlier this week. For those of you who don’t feel like sloshing through several pages of &lt;a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf"&gt;legal drudgery,&lt;/a&gt; a brief summary:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been deemed property rather than currency, which means they will be subject to capital gains tax when they are sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin ‘investors’  or holders are treated essentially like stock investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly to stocks, the rate bitcoin is taxed will depend on how long the bitcoins have been held. If they’ve been owned for over a year, the rate is a maximum of 23.8%. If they’ve been owned for less than that, they’re taxable at up to 43.3%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re unfortunate enough to have capital losses, you can deduct up to $3,000 worth of those from your ordinary income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re mining, you’re expected to report the fair market value of the coin as of that day, and it’s taxable as gross income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re paid in bitcoin, you have to pay taxes on it with a standard W-2 (federal income tax withholding applies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many questions have been circulating as to what this implies exactly for the future of cryptocurrency, and how it will impact the rate of bitcoin adoption. From my perspective, the primary takeaway from the ruling is that people holding bitcoin will have to keep track of their transactions and report the capital gains on the currency from the time they acquired it to the time they made transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if I purchased one bitcoin at $100 and then then used that a year later to buy a couch on Overstock.com, and by that point my bitcoin had appreciated to $500, I would have to pay a tax on the difference, in this case $400. This is a hassle. No one wants to keep track of every single purchase they make, and filing taxes is already about as much fun as stabbing yourself in the eye...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/what-the-irs-ruling-actually-means-for-bitcoin&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How Do We Make Bitcoin User-Friendly?</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <link>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/how-do-we-make-bitcoin-user-friendly</link>
      <guid>https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/how-do-we-make-bitcoin-user-friendly</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;One of the main criticisms of Bitcoin today is that it isn’t user-friendly. It’ll never catch on with the mainstream population, it’s destined to stay confined to a small group of hardcore techie users, and so forth.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve stated &lt;a href="http://www.ariannasimpson.com/isnt-business-accepting-bitcoins/?utm_source=Bitcoin+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=051c55d54c-Bitcoin_Newsletter3_11_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_102ecce660-051c55d54c-116402341"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; that the level of bitcoin adoption is closely tied to its usability, and that will change with the growth of an ecosystem of companies around it. Some companies are already making it easy to use, and the latest among them is &lt;a href="https://www.onename.io/"&gt;OneName&lt;/a&gt;, a decentralized identity system (DIS) with a user directory made of entries in a decentralized key-value store (the Namecoin blockchain). They’re basically applying the Bitcoin protocol to information— your username, bitcoin address, etc (see screenshot below) are stored in the namecoin protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that having your information in the blockchain is cool, (nerd alert, sorry) it’s also a great leap forward in terms of bitcoin’s usability. Up to this point, sharing your bitcoin address has been cumbersome. Unless you want to memorize a string of random numbers and letters, you have to resort to copy + pasting it to send to anyone who wants to pay you. There’s really no way to do so verbally without subjecting your interlocutor to auditory assault. Even assuming you felt like memorizing your address, there’s next to no chance that the poor recipient is going to remember more than one or two of the string of bits you’re spewing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the best user experience, and it’s different from handy apps like Venmo, in which you can find your friends by name via your email + social network contacts. OneName—which launched last week —brings the same ease of use to bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To...&lt;a href=https://www.ariannasimpson.com/blog/how-do-we-make-bitcoin-user-friendly&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;</description>
