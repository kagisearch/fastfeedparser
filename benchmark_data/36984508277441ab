&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"You're an idiot,"&lt;/em&gt; my friend declared, watching me crawl through another hour of Toronto traffic. "Who lives downtown just to commute an hour and a half outside the city?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving an hour outside Toronto would slash my living costs and eliminate my soul-crushing daily commute on the Gardiner Expressway (think NYC's FDR Drive or LA's 101) — where the highway feels more like a stationary parking lot and my morning coffee goes cold before I move a kilometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, it's a no-brainer: trade gridlock for extra hours of productivity (and save $). Who wouldn't want more time and money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've learned that productivity follows a different kind of math. It's not about hours — it's about &lt;em&gt;voltage.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-urban-circuit&gt;The Urban Circuit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered this voltage equation during medical training, as I bounced between Toronto and two smaller cities, Hamilton and Kingston. Each sits a few hours from Toronto, like most satellite towns that orbit major metropolises — and made me feel like a loose connection searching for its socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time I unplugged from Toronto for a smaller city, something inside me dimmed. Not dramatically, but more like someone slowly turning down a dimmer switch on my ambition. The fire to break free from traditional medicine — to build something beyond the usual clinic-to-grave path — flickered dangerously low. Projects that once felt urgent became &lt;em&gt;maybe later&lt;/em&gt;. Ideas that used to keep me up at night quietly faded into background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I'd plug back into Toronto for brief clinical rotations, and that internal voltage would surge through my circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift was unmistakable. Suddenly, I'd find myself at 1 AM, hunched over my laptop, drafting emails to strangers who had no reason to respond, searching for that third door everyone else had missed. My mind would crackle with the kind of electricity that makes you forget sleep exists — the type that transforms a 2 AM cold-email to a CEO from &lt;em&gt;crazy&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;inevitable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This voltage effect isn't unique to Toronto. Like power stations on a continental grid, major cities generate different voltages - Singapore's quiet intensity, Tokyo's ambitious hum, LA's creative surge. But none run quite as high as New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recent longevity medicine conference there, I witnessed what happens when you crank up the current: physicians building AI-powered diagnostic tools, launching direct-to-consumer health platforms, and reimagining the 15-minute appointment into personalized health journeys. Next to these innovations, traditional medicine's "see patient, prescribe pill" approach looked like candlelight in the age of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="portrait-group"&gt;

  &lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tkhan/tokyo-trains-electric-citiy.webp"class="portrait" alt="Man training with a punching bag - portrait 2"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each night, I'd return to my hotel room with my circuits overloaded, sparks of possibility firing in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daily frustrations and career uncertainties that had been living rent-free in my head? Vaporized by the sheer density of people daring to colour outside the lines. It was a preview of what happens when you plug into a higher voltage grid. Which makes my relationship with Toronto &lt;em&gt;complicated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear: I don't love Toronto. The city grates on me - its infrastructure is a mess, its social scene hibernates, its spontaneity non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could plug into a higher-voltage grid like New York or Singapore, I would in a heartbeat. But within Canadian borders, Toronto - despite running at a lower voltage - generates just enough buzz to keep my circuits alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto embodies a peculiar paradox. It's a city that celebrates mediocrity while its most ambitious residents quietly plan their escape to higher-voltage grids. A recent &lt;a href='https://open.substack.com/pub/mishaglouberman/p/stop-pretending-toronto-is-more-than?r=fdli9&amp;utm_medium=ios'&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; captured the city's "go-for-bronze mentality" perfectly. While New York or the Bay Area naturally attract those seeking to reshape reality, Toronto seems caught between aspiration and contentment. Despite its imperfections, this voltage remains the strongest grid available to me without crossing borders or completely rewiring my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to the suburbs might save me time, but at what cost? In places like Hamilton or Kingston, those cities that orbit every major metropolis, ideas that once sparked action become perpetual 'somedays'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these smaller towns run at a lower voltage, they taught me something crucial about environment. I discovered this truth in Kingston, in the most unexpected place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every morning at 6 AM, in a no-frills gym that smelled of iron and determination, I'd watch someone grunt through their final squat rep with twice my max weight, making my own impossible suddenly seem &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;. When my legs would shake on rep six, seeing others push to eight would force me to question my limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That environment — the shared suffering, the silent nods of recognition, the collective push beyond comfort — showed me just how much environment shapes what we believe possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are just moments, isolated surges. These smaller towns hum at a different voltage — appropriately tuned for family life and putting down roots, but not calibrated for restless minds and pathless wanderers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="portrait-group"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tkhan/cn-tower-reflection-2.webp" class="portrait" alt="Man training with a punching bag - portrait 1"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tkhan/old-parliament-reflection-2.webp" class="portrait" alt="Man training with a punching bag - portrait 2"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=engineering-your-grid&gt;Engineering Your Grid&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This voltage equation isn't as simple as "big city good, small town bad." In Toronto or New York, voltage isn't something you schedule for 6 AM. It's in every coffee shop conversation, every chance encounter, every breath of city air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, being present isn't enough. Sometimes the energy dims, or you find yourself isolated despite the density around you. The reality is, no matter where you plug in, you need to find intentional ways to boost your voltage, rather than solely relying on the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look around and you'll find micro-communities of people doing exactly this, engineering their own voltage in creative ways. Some gather in coffee shops or co-working spaces, others build digital accountability groups, and some embrace more unconventional approaches to recreate a high-voltage environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take virtual co-working sessions, for example. Picture dozens of strangers sitting silently on camera, typing away like some weird digital library — everyone is visible from the waist up, conversation is forbidden, and pants are optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why not just work alone?" some people ask, mystified by these digital productivity séances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyone who's joined a writer's group understands the appeal. Sure, you could write alone in your room, but something about seeing others wrestling with their drafts makes your own excuses feel paper-thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These voltage seekers aren't just avoiding loneliness — they're recreating a subtle pressure of shared possibility and silent accountability that comes from watching others stretch their perceived capabilities. Even through pixels and wifi signals, seeing someone else in flow state makes your own Netflix temptations feel suddenly resistible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself engineering these connections everywhere — scheduling calls with like minds scattered across continents, joining digital workspaces, niche WhatsApp groups, and seeking out busy coffee shops where the ambient buzz makes stillness uncomfortable. It's about creating artificial proximity when natural encounters aren't enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all just trying to stay charged, however we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tkhan/shibuya-crossing-1.webp
" alt="Description of image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=maximum-voltage&gt;Maximum Voltage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these engineered micro-environments help, the strongest surge comes from finding your &lt;em&gt;tribe&lt;/em&gt; of ambitious minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their presence becomes both comfort and catalyst, living proof that your &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; might just be possible. Their setbacks normalize the struggle. Their breakthroughs recalibrate your limiting beliefs and suffocate your excuses for settling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geography alone doesn't explain it. Neither do people. The environment equation is more complex than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what makes this so tricky to quantify. It's the physical energy of a city, yes, but it's also the friction of competing ideas, the spark of unexpected connections, and the energy that flows when paths intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities, people, conversations — they're all circuits in this vast power grid of potential. Some connections hit you like lightning; others build charge slowly, steadily, until one day you realize you're running at a higher voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while you can't always map the exact path to your goals, you can choose where to plug in, intentionally designing an environment that keeps your energy high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're trying to build something from nothing, when no one's holding you accountable but yourself, environment isn't just about productivity hours. It's about finding the right voltage, where self-doubt gets drowned out by the electric hum of others breaking through barriers you thought unbreakable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These surges of current aren't just nice-to-haves; they're the power source that keeps your ambitions from dimming. The alternative is environmental inertia, where every doubt acts like a circuit breaker, every setback feels like a blown fuse, and every "maybe later" becomes another unrealized vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no, I won't be moving an hour away to save a few hours of commute time. Sure, I'd gain back hours in an oversimplified equation, but they'd be low-voltage hours in a dimly lit suburb. In the complex equation of turning ideas into reality, that's a productivity drain I can't afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people find their voltage in mountain peaks or ocean waves — I do too, in certain doses. But when you're trying to venture beyond well-worn routes, you don't just need occasional surges — you need a grid that never fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;"What are you training for?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between my fourth set of heavy squats at 6 AM, a woman at my gym asked me this. After all, most people don't voluntarily push their limits in the dark hours before sunrise unless they're chasing medals or trophies. Powerlifters train for meets. Runners train for races. But training to outrun the future I witness daily in my hospital's long-term care unit? That's not exactly gym small talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm training for &lt;em&gt;life,&lt;/em&gt;" I said, trying not to sound too melodramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She laughed, probably thinking I was being dramatic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I was thinking about the previous day's hospital rounds. The daily parade of decline I witness as people's bodies betray them in their most vulnerable moments. The decline that starts decades before modern medicine even thinks to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hip fracture that stole a grandmother from her family? That story began with unnoticed muscle loss in her forties. The heart failure that forced a father to miss his son's wedding? That started with poor cardiovascular fitness in his thirties. The dementia that erased a lifetime of memories? Those warning signs were there in midlife — all of it measurable, if only we'd known where to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a hospitalist, I don't just treat disease. I witness the final chapter of choices made decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each hospital admission tells two stories: today's crisis and yesterday's missed signals. While we obsess over steps and calories, the real predictors — VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max, muscle mass, metabolic health — slip by unmeasured until it's too late.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=sweat-without-strategy&gt;Sweat Without Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see this disconnect every morning at the gym, where we mistake athletic achievement for health, performance for protection, medals for immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's the marathoner next to me. Her Instagram is a shrine to race medals and "clean eating." Her Apple Watch celebrates another perfect week while mine just checks for signs of life between hospital shifts (thanks, doctor schedule). She's crushing her move goals and collecting medals, but there's a darker story her watch can't track: ask her to do a pull-up, and gravity mocks her medals. Her strength tests read like a warning label: &lt;em&gt;Bottom 20%&lt;/em&gt; for her age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years from now, those marathon medals will have built her endurance, but they won't be enough alone to prevent a fall. Her dedication is admirable. It takes grit to train for long races and achieve such milestones. But focusing on a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; aspect of fitness, like endurance, often leaves gaps in the bigger picture of what our bodies need to thrive for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These athletic achievements, though impressive, build only partial foundations for health. They're chapters in a larger story, but not the complete narrative our bodies need for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every January, we pick our tribe, cardio or strength, and dig our trenches there. While we celebrate finish lines and personal record (PR) boards, our bodies quietly track a more complete set of scores — ones that determine whether we'll thrive in the decades ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;em&gt;"just move"&lt;/em&gt; has been medicine's universal prescription. It's our profession's equivalent of "eat your vegetables." It's like handing someone a compass that only points "somewhere north" and calling it navigation. I've written these prescriptions myself, watched patients nod and smile, both of us knowing it's not enough. I've also logged countless miles and lifted endless weights without knowing if I was building what really mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, between sets that leave me gasping, I wrestle with better questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which measurements actually predict our future health?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we know if we're building the right kind of resilience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What numbers should we really be tracking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I'm grinding through another workout at dawn, I'm not just chasing better numbers — I'm trying to buy time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for adventures I haven't taken yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to remain independent and capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to be the person who helps others up from their chairs, not the one needing help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, time isn't bought blindly. It's earned by understanding the quiet signals our bodies send long before disease announces itself. We need to learn the language of longevity, a dialect few of us were ever taught to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three key measurements help us start this vital conversation with our bodies, speaking a language most fitness trackers never learned to translate.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-numbers-that-buy-us-time&gt;The Numbers That Buy Us Time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=1vosub2sub-max-your-bodys-hidden-speed-limit&gt;1.VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Max: Your Body’s Hidden Speed Limit&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people see VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max as just another fitness metric — the difference between an easy 5K and gasping up stairs. But, I read it differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the number that predicts who makes it to their grandchild's graduation and who watches from a video call. Who dances at their daughter's wedding and who struggles to make it down the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max measures the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during intense exercise. It serves as an indicator of how efficiently your heart, lungs, and cell machinery work together to deliver oxygen—a critical function that supports nearly every aspect of your health, from energy levels to brain function. Beyond making daily activities easier, it's an important predictor of whether you're able to show up for life’s pivotal moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science backs this up with stark clarity. Multiple landmark studies (including one following 122,000 patients) showed that having a low VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max is &lt;em&gt;four times&lt;/em&gt; deadlier than being a chain smoker. Not because being out of breath kills you, but because poor cardiovascular fitness creates a perfect storm for everything from diabetes to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max in the bottom 25% multiplies your risk of early death &lt;em&gt;fivefold.&lt;/em&gt; It also leaves you far more exposed to chronic diseases that can rob you of your independence and quality of life — diabetes, hypertension, dementia, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, here's what gives me hope: just moving from "poor" to "below average"—a change most people can achieve in months—cuts that risk in &lt;em&gt;half.&lt;/em&gt; It’s like building a shield against time, offering protection that no medication in our current arsenal comes close to delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=2visceral-fat-the-hidden-saboteur&gt;2.Visceral Fat: The Hidden Saboteur&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing in front of patients day after day has taught me something medical school never could: the mirror &lt;em&gt;lies,&lt;/em&gt; and it lies beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen seemingly "fit" individuals crumble under the weight of hidden health burdens, while those society might label "overweight" sometimes carry surprising metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirrors sell stories. Body composition scans tell truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That layer of fat you can pinch? It's the one we obsess over but matters least. The real threat lurks deeper: visceral fat, the silent saboteur wrapped around your organs. Unlike the superficial fat beneath your skin, visceral fat actively drives chronic inflammation and metabolic imbalances, accelerating conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and even certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the scale lies &lt;em&gt;twice:&lt;/em&gt; first about the problem, by focusing your attention on visible fat rather than the hidden dangers of visceral fat; and second about the solution, by celebrating weight loss that might come from precious muscle instead of harmful visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those five pounds you just lost? Congratulations - but what exactly did you win? The grand prize (visceral fat), the booby prize (precious muscle), or just the consolation trophy (superficial fat)? The mirror and scale might be applauding while your metabolic health quietly deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2018 European Heart Journal study revealed the deception: "fit-looking" individuals with high visceral fat faced the same heart attack risks as visibly overweight peers. This is why I insist on DEXA scans; they see past the mirror's lies. You might be winning the reflection game while losing the health war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=3-strength-the-insurance-policy-most-people-skip&gt;3. Strength: The Insurance Policy Most People Skip&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what terrifies me as a doctor: the moment someone slips on a curb or misses a step on the stairs and breaks their hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like an accident; a random, unfortunate moment. But that moment was decades in the making. It began in their 30s and 40s, as muscle strength quietly eroded and balance faltered, unnoticed and untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same quiet decline that makes a fall catastrophic also sets the stage for conditions like dementia. That diagnosis at 65? The risk factors were measurable in muscle loss decades earlier. Every day, I watch patients receive diagnoses they think came out of nowhere, when their bodies had been warning them for twenty years through declining strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your muscles aren't just for lifting weights. They're your body's command center and shield against decline. They regulate glucose, fight inflammation, protect your brain, and keep you stable. Strong muscles don't just prevent falls; they slash your risk of dementia, cancer, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hospital, I witness a devastating cascade: a fall leads to a broken hip, then a hospital stay, and then rapid muscle loss. Within a year, 40% of these patients will be gone—not from the fall itself, but from the vulnerability that follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link is clear: muscle is life. Studies show that low muscle mass increases your risk of early death by 60-67%. This is why preserving and building muscle throughout your life isn’t just about aesthetics or athletic performance—it’s about survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After age 30, your body starts shedding 3-5% of muscle mass every decade unless you actively fight back. And among all measures of muscle strength, grip strength stands out as an unassuming yet powerful predictor of longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research consistently shows that it outperforms most medical tests in forecasting survival, acting as a barometer for your overall physical resilience. While leg strength also plays a critical role, grip strength is generally easier to measure and has become a convenient proxy for overall strength in medical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? Unlike many aspects of aging, this isn't a battle we're destined to lose. Even 90-year-olds have demonstrated the ability to build muscle and strength with the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong at 65 isn't a gift from the universe. It's a love letter you write to your &lt;em&gt;future self, now.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=beyond-just-move&gt;Beyond "Just Move"&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you what I do, what I insist my loved ones do, what I wish every patient had done decades ago. And if you're reading this thinking "sooner" has already passed you by, take heart. I've seen 70-year-olds transform their health metrics more dramatically than some 30-year-olds. &lt;em&gt;Your body is ready whenever you are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step: Get your numbers. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of these metrics as your body's early warning system [recognizing these are simplified versions of complex medical indicators]: DEXA scans exposing the truth behind the mirror's lies, VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max revealing how much life your heart can sustain, and grip (or leg) strength forecasting whether you'll need help opening jars at 55 or helping others move furniture at 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I examine these numbers for myself, I'm reviewing early drafts of my future health. They tell me where to focus, where to push harder, where to pull back. They offer a chance to edit my story while there’s still time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's your weekly insurance policy against my hospital bed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-3 strength sessions focusing on compound movements (because bicep curls alone won't help you wrestle your luggage into overhead bins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-3 steady (zone 2) cardio sessions at a pace where you can hold a conversation about pizza toppings (if you're too breathless to argue about pineapple, you're pushing too hard — dial it back)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 high-intensity session (“outrunning a zombie” level of effort)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this template seems overwhelming, remember: moving the needle doesn't require moving mountains. Each small victory — whether it's five minutes of breathwork or learning to properly lift a grocery bag — writes a better page in your story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start&lt;/em&gt; where you are, &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; what you have, and &lt;em&gt;show up&lt;/em&gt; in whatever way you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key isn't following this template like it's gospel. Think of it as preventive diligence: find the weak spots now, in your thirties and forties, before they become the chronic diseases I diagnose in my fifties and sixties patients.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tkhan-1718390584-7.jpg" class="landscape" alt="Woman rowing a boat, symbolizing balance and effort"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=when-movement-meets-purpose&gt;When Movement Meets Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are you training for?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question still lingers in my mind from the gym to my hospital rounds every day. While I'm loading plates onto the bar at 6 AM, I'm thinking about the patient I diagnosed with early dementia that week - a battle that began silently decades ago. While I'm pushing through another zone 2 training session, I'm thinking about my mother's cancer diagnosis at 49. Every training session becomes a rebellion against that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a world of difference between exercise and training. &lt;em&gt;Exercise&lt;/em&gt; mistakes motion for progress: random runs, scattered lifts, whatever feels good today. &lt;em&gt;Training&lt;/em&gt; measures what matters and moves with purpose. Every rep — every heart rate zone — serves tomorrow's health, not today's sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the moment a doctor delivers a diagnosis isn't the beginning of the battle. It's the echo of a fight that was won or lost decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these battles we'll lose despite our best efforts. I've watched genetics play cruel hands to even my most dedicated patients. But right now, in your body, these processes are already in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I training for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm training to stay on this side of the hospital bed. I'm training to be the one helping others up from their chairs, not the one needing help. I’m training to write a different ending to my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you can't chase marathon times or powerlifting records. Those are worthy athletic achievements. But recognize them for what they are: athletic goals, not guarantees of longevity. The numbers that matter most aren't always on your finisher medals or gym leaderboard. They are written in your cells, your mitochondria, your muscles. They’re the choices you’re making today that determine whether you’ll live with abundant reserves or face a future of physical bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body &lt;em&gt;whispers&lt;/em&gt; its truths decades before disease &lt;em&gt;shouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen early, and you can revise the script of your future, making edits that might mean the difference between thriving and just surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen late, and you might find yourself reading an ending you didn’t choose — in a hospital bed, wondering why no one taught you the language your body had been speaking all along.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact:&lt;/strong&gt; Every photo in this essay was taken by yours truly. Photography has been my quiet escape, a way to capture the world when words fall short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One a more personal note, I wrestle with a small insecurity. People often tell me they like my photos more than my writing. &lt;em&gt;Ouch,&lt;/em&gt; right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, we’re all works in progress. One day, the goal is for you to feel equally torn between the two. Or, dare I hope, to have my words edge out the pictures. Until then, I’ll keep chasing the perfect sentence while you enjoy the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And finally, a heartfelt gratitude to Deepti Chopra, Jon Bula, and Chris Wong whose insights and feedback helped shape this piece.&lt;/em&gt;

    <title>Creating to Be Seen: My Battle Against Oblivion</title>
    <updated>2025-01-15T00:24:59.755424+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As I stood there, camera ready, watching the first light creep over the horizon, I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. The fear that this moment, like so many others, would slip away forever if I couldn't somehow capture it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fingers trembled slightly against the cold metal of the camera, but it wasn't just the pre-dawn chill. Two hours earlier, while the world slept, I had dragged myself out of warm sheets, driven through empty streets, and climbed this hillside in darkness. The absurdity wasn't lost on me - trading warm sleep for cold fingers and the possibility of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world doesn't wait for us. The light shifts, shadows fall, and moments pass, indifferent to our presence. But for a split second, with my lens poised and focus set, it feels as though I'm holding time itself, refusing to let these moments slip into the flow of obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; about photography. It's about a more primal terror.
The knowledge that every way we understand and experience the world, every unique perspective and insight, could vanish without trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each click of the shutter is my way of saying: &lt;em&gt;I saw this. I was here. This mattered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each morning I venture out to shoot becomes a small act of defiance against time's endless march. In the hills of Porto, as I watched the soft light paint the horizon, the mist hovering over silent streets, the way shadows slowly retreat from the ancient landscape, I realized that these aren't just scenes - they're fragments of time that would slip away unmarked if I couldn't somehow capture their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something almost compulsive about it now - this need to translate the intangible into something concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't chase these pre-dawn moments because it's fun. I chase them because the alternative creates a lingering discomfort I can't shake. It’s a discomfort that extends beyond photography; it's the quiet torment every creator knows, whether they're racing to capture a fleeting idea in words before it evaporates, watching the perfect turn of phrase dissolve mid-thought, or struggling to translate a business vision into reality before someone else does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not panic or pain, but the burden of watching our unique perspectives slip through our fingers like sand. Each act of creation - whether through lens, pen, or code - becomes a small rebellion agains impermanence; our refusal to let these moments of vanish unmarked without our stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other forms of achievement that can be measured or replicated, creation leaves behind something unnervingly personal. You can't fake that kind of evidence. You can't retroactively construct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each creation becomes a time stamp of existence, proof that someone saw the world exactly this way, at exactly this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative is terrifying. To live and die without leaving any evidence of how we saw and understood the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I create because I'm terrified of becoming invisible, haunted by the fear of oblivion. Each creation becomes a rebellion against obscurity, against a universe vast enough to swallow whole galaxies without notice. Each frame becomes evidence in a case I'm building, not for posterity or legacy, but for the simple fact of my own consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing there on that hillside, watching dawn paint the sky in impossible colors, I understood again why I do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this translation of consciousness into reality demands a price.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-price-of-making-something-real&gt;The Price of Making Something Real&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating anything demands a specific kind of madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experience it most intimately through photography—the pre-dawn chases for perfect light—and most painfully in building a business, where each iteration strips away another layer of certainty. But the pattern reveals itself in every attempt to create, each one extracting its own peculiar toll, each revealing something unsettling about what we'll sacrifice to make something real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over years of chasing sunrise shots in different locations, I've watched tourists snap quick photos and leave, satisfied with documenting that they were there. But I linger, searching for something more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One summer at Lake Bled in Slovenia, this hunger drove me to spend four consecutive mornings hiking to different vantage points around the lake. Each morning, I stayed for hours, moving inches left or right, waiting for the light to shift just so, searching for that precise composition that matched what my mind's eye saw. Not just the scene itself, but the feeling it evoked, the story it told. Each morning, I watched the sunrise paint the church spire, the castle walls, the mirror-smooth water in slightly different hues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have taken a decent photo on any of those mornings, the kind that tourists post on Instagram and move on. But I believed that if the conditions aligned exactly right, if the mist hung just so over the water, if the light caught the church tower at precisely the right angle, I could capture something extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three mornings brought their own versions of "almost." Too many clouds one day, harsh winds the next, then perfect technical conditions that somehow still missed the essence of what I saw. Each "failure" taught me something new about the lake, about light, about what I was really searching for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; morning, while others slept, I climbed higher than before, to a vantage point I'd discovered during previous attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-dawn air was still, holding its breath. Then the clouds began to part, and sunlight burst through like heaven's spotlight, casting golden beams across the lake's mirror surface. The church spire emerged beneath this ethereal glow, so perfect it seemed almost unreal. Mountains stood sentinel in the distance, their peaks softened by the morning light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally pressed the shutter, I knew. This wasn't just a pretty picture of Lake Bled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was how I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/tkhan-1718390176-1.jpg" class="landscape" alt="Tahsin Khan"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While photography reveals one face of the price of creation through this relentless pursuit of excellence, building a business has extracted an even steeper toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past nine months, I've watched my business ideas fall apart under scrutiny. What seemed brilliant at midnight dissolves by morning - my own market research reveals fatal flaws, conversations with potential investors expose blind spots, mentors point out competitors I hadn't considered. Each conversation with industry experts, each deep dive into market analysis, strips away another layer of naive assumptions. Each iteration brings me back to square one, humbler but somehow more determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in scale becomes clear in what's at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a failed photograph costs only time and sleep, a business demands &lt;em&gt;everything.&lt;/em&gt; And the price cuts deeper because I'm still in the midst of the process. There's no finished creation yet to justify the sacrifice, only the daily confrontation with what doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the price is measured in dinners cut short for networking calls, in friendships that fade as work consumes every conversation, in the growing distance from family who can't understand why a steady job isn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress seeps into everything: that tightness in my chest when another assumption proves wrong, the weight in my stomach each morning wondering if today's the day I should quit, the way my thoughts spiral into worst-case scenarios during what should be quiet moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, in building a business, the act of creating exacts every sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety hums in the background, seeping into every moment, turning simple pleasures into stolen time. Potential disasters invade my thoughts during family dinners, competitor updates take priority over good morning texts, and even relaxation begins to feel like a lapse in responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day becomes a battle between the voice that says “this might never work” and the deeper conviction that stopping now would mean accepting defeat.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=mirror-of-creation-how-making-shapes-the-maker&gt;Mirror of Creation: How Making Shapes the Maker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, I keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not because it's enjoyable; it's often painful, humbling, even frightening. There's something desperate in this persistence, a refusal to let all these months of toil disappear without creating something real. A refusal to be labelled as insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because here, every part of me (the messy, brilliant, intense) finally finds its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about finding nobility in suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pre-dawn alarms suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failed attempts are brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty is exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what makes the struggle matter: each moment of difficulty is an invitation to quit. Each setback offers a perfectly reasonable exit. The greater the struggle, the more numerous these exits become, each one whispering "You've done enough. No one would blame you for stopping here."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's not just about creating, but the pursuit of something rare and difficult, something I had to reach beyond myself to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want my creations to capture something elusive, pushing beyond the obvious until I'm left with something that feels earned. The satisfaction isn't just in having captured something beautiful, but in knowing that this particular thing could only exist because I refused to settle, and that I paid a price for it. Through this dual struggle, I earn the right to call it mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time a photograph emerges from dozens of failed attempts, or a business concept survives countless brutal iterations, something profound has happened. The suffering isn't redeemed or made meaningful - it simply serves as a signpost of how many times we could have quit but didn't. Each creation becomes forensic evidence of our refusal to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's in these moments of persistence, through these painful transformations, that we emerge with more than just artifacts of our effort. This transformation often demands everything I have, and sometimes more than I think I can give. It requires confronting my limitations, facing my failures, and pushing beyond what I believed possible. Not because creating simply changes us, but because it demands we become something more than we currently are to match its vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creation becomes a mirror, reflecting back pieces of identity I hadn't recognized before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time I choose to start over rather than settle, each time I push past what seems reasonable in pursuit of something that exists only in my mind's eye, I'm learning something fundamental about who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What begins as a quest to capture moments becomes a process of self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't calculated decisions. They're instinctive choices that reveal what truly drives us. When we look back at these moments, we see our values not as we imagined them, but as they actually are: proven through action, tested by sacrifice, revealed in the space between acceptable and excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each creation becomes both verdict and artifact; proof not just that I existed, but of how the making transformed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm learning that the person who started this journey no longer exists. The trail of work I leave behind marks more than just what I created - it maps the territory between who I was and who I'm becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be creation's most profound revelation. We are not just the makers, but the thing being made. In the end, our creations don't just prove we existed. &lt;em&gt;They prove that we lived.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never created, if you've never poured your own chaos, your own joy, your own fire into something that wasn't there before, I challenge you to start. Don't let this life pass by without at least tasting this feeling. Because when you look back at the trail of creations you've left behind, each one marked with your unique signature of effort, vision and persistence, you'll see more than just things you made. You'll see a map of who you became in the making.

    <title>The Lie Behind Every ‘Yes’: Why Being Polite Is Making Us Less Kind</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A LinkedIn message appears: Mark, a former colleague, is "just checking in to grab coffee sometime."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same Mark who spent two years sitting ten feet away, never once asking about life beyond deadline updates. Now, he needs "just 30 minutes" to "pick your brain" about industry connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found the choreography is always the same. The forced small talk at some overpriced café, the practiced casualness as the conversation steers toward who you know at Company X, the subtle pressure to make introductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real, you’ll likely spend the whole time crafting an exit strategy while nodding along to his plans (sudden onset hamster flu? A family emergency involving your cousin’s goldfish?). The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your thumb moves on autopilot. &lt;em&gt;Tap...tap...tap.&lt;/em&gt; “I would love to catch up!”, you type, while rehearsing the calendar conflicts you’ll invent next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine an alternate scenario. One where your response skips the social padding, making you wince for a moment at how unpolished it feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hi Mark, I appreciate the invitation, but I’d prefer not to get coffee. We weren't close when we worked together, and I suspect you're only reaching out because you need something from me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us would rather add another entry to our running list of future fake conflicts than deliver such unvarnished truth. We convince ourselves we're being kind, sparing others from uncomfortable truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, these moments add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every polite excuse and subtle deflection becomes another entry in our personal playbook of avoidance. The question is: what are we avoiding?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-comfort-of-politeness&gt;The Comfort of “Politeness”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest about being dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tell ourselves that politeness protects others' feelings, the real driver isn't consideration - it's fear. We dread the awkward silence, the hurt look, the social consequences of honesty. So we hide behind carefully crafted deflections and well-timed excuses. In our desperate attempts to avoid these moments, we build walls of polite fiction to protect ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what are we protecting ourselves from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discomfort of setting boundaries? The fear of being seen as difficult? The awkwardness of admitting that not every professional connection needs to be a friendship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politeness isn't kindness. It's armor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider these common scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreeing to attend events we don’t intend to go to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making vague promises to "catch up soon" with people we hope to never see again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Praising Dave's PowerPoint presentation like it's the next TED talk when it's really death by bullet points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, social graces have their place. No one is suggesting we abandon all filters and express every thought that crosses our mind. But there’s a difference between being courteous and falling into reflexive politeness that slips into lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtesy means acknowledging the humanity in others. It includes holding doors, saying thank you, and being on time. These small acts of consideration oil the machinery of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politeness is different. It's when we say 'I'd love to!' while mentally searching for future excuses. It's praising mediocre work instead of offering helpful feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reflects genuine consideration for others. The other reflects our fear of discomfort. And sometimes, as I would learn, that comfort comes at a devastating cost.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=when-politeness-breeds-flakes&gt;When Politeness Breeds Flakes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our culture of reflexive politeness has bred an epidemic of unreliability. When fear drives us to polite avoidance, flakiness follows naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say ‘yes’ to things we don’t want to do. Then, we spend more energy escaping these commitments than it would have taken to decline them honestly. This triggers an exhausting chain reaction - fake enthusiasm, delayed responses, manufactured emergencies, and perpetual rescheduling, until we run out of excuses. Finally, we ghost - the ultimate act of avoidance that leaves both parties knowing the truth but pretending otherwise. Each step feels easier than the simple truth we could have offered at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our calendars become graveyards of half-hearted commitments, where 'let's grab coffee sometime' has become more greeting than invitation. 'Yes' means 'maybe,' and 'maybe' almost always means 'no.' We've normalized flakiness by dressing it up as social etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a deeper cost. Each time we say 'yes' to obligations we don't want, we steal opportunities from commitments that matter. A 'yes' only carries weight when we've learned to say 'no.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the truth: there are no social obligations, only consequences. Every 'yes' we give to avoid awkwardness becomes a future commitment we'll need to dodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where everyone is busy avoiding commitments they never wanted to make, genuine availability has become extinct. We mistake politeness for kindness the way we mistake a smile for joy - it's the costume kindness wears when it's too afraid to show up as itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this landscape of perpetual avoidance, follow-through has become extinct, and reliability feels like a superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mark's LinkedIn message might seem like a minor annoyance, these patterns of politeness-over-honesty play out in more consequential ways. I learned this lesson first-hand last year, watching a seven-year friendship dissolve over months of polite fiction.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=when-politeness-poisons&gt;When Politeness Poisons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began innocently. While discussing a business idea I'd been developing, my friend's eyes lit up. "We should do this together!" he exclaimed. "I've been thinking about this idea myself and there's a lot of potential here." His enthusiasm was contagious, and I welcomed the possibility of partnering with someone I trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent weeks crafting briefs, sharing industry research, and creating frameworks to get him up to speed. Each time we met, he'd nod along enthusiastically, promising to dive deeper before our next discussion. But every deadline slipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-week follow-ups turned into four-week delays. "Sorry, crazy week with my other priorities" became his refrain. Each meeting started with the same apologetic smile, the same promises to be better prepared next time. We repeated the same conversations from weeks ago because he hadn't fully reviewed the materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I kept investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created more summaries, scheduled more calls, and believed his polite assurances that he was “definitely still interested in this.” Meanwhile, months slipped by with no progress. The same fundamental questions about our business model remained unanswered while I watched my momentum drain into the void of his perpetual ‘almost ready.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His politeness - his need to appear engaged while avoiding honest conversation - wasn't protecting our relationship. It was prolonging its decay. Each deflection added another crack to our foundation, until what started as a promising partnership collapsed under the weight of unspoken truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four weeks after our penultimate discussion, he showed up unprepared, still talking about why the industry was exciting. It was as if we were still at square one, not three months into planning. Then he scheduled one last follow-up meeting - his idea, his chosen time - and didn't show up. No message. No explanation. Just silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I realized his politeness had been a shield, protecting him from admitting the truth: this was too much work for too little reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By prioritizing the appearance of interest over honesty, we both lost. I lost months of momentum and hours of work. He lost credibility. And we lost a friendship that had weathered seven years only to dissolve in a fog of polite lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was grieving not just the end of a friendship, but the way it ended - death by a thousand polite deflections. The realization that years of shared experiences, inside jokes, and late-night conversations weren't enough to earn basic honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the insidious nature of politeness. It doesn't just create single moments of inauthenticity. It creates a feedback loop where fear feeds silence and silence breeds more fear. Each polite deflection makes the next honest conversation feel progressively out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that we lack courage (though that’s partly true). It’s that we lack language. Most of us weren’t taught how to say “This is harder than I expected and I’m not sure I can commit” without feeling like we’re burning bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, he needed a bit more backbone too (or a spine transplant). But what he needed more was a framework that would allow him to express doubt without affecting our relationship.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=breaking-free-from-polite-prison&gt;Breaking Free from Polite Prison&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path to honesty can take two forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is direct: 'No, thank you. This isn't a priority for me right now.' This approach works well for those comfortable with straightforward communication (like the truthful response to Mark).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that level of directness makes you uncomfortable, there's another way. Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication framework provides a path forward instead of offering vague platitudes or avoiding difficult conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observe&lt;/strong&gt; without judgment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express &lt;strong&gt;feelings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect feelings to &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a specific &lt;strong&gt;request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if my friend had expressed his needs more authentically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I appreciate all the work you've put into this [observation]. I'm feeling overwhelmed and uncertain [feeling] because I need more time to evaluate if I can fully commit to this venture [need]. Could we pause our planning while I reassess my capacity for this project? [request]."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This response would have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respected my time and emotional investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowed us to adjust expectations or gracefully end the exploration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserved our friendship instead of adding it to the graveyard of ghosted relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds simple. But like learning any new language, this way of communicating requires us to rewire decades of habits. We retreat to politeness not because it's optimal, but because it's the only language we have practiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, our first attempts will be awkward. We'll fumble over words and question our timing. But what's the alternative? To keep building relationships on the quicksand of polite fiction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our desperate attempt to avoid conflict, we've confused politeness with kindness. It's the smile that masks indifference, the promise we never intend to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politeness preserves appearances. Kindness preserves relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't need more politeness. &lt;em&gt;We need the bravery to be kind.&lt;/em&gt;

    <title>Surprising Questions That Have Changed My Approach</title>
    <updated>2025-01-15T00:27:00.678100+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=what-was-that-like-for-you&gt;"What was that like for you?"&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned this from David Brook's new book - How To Know a Person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask this question when someone brings up a topic that sounds like it was challenging for them i.e. argument with their partner, hearing a difficult news, remarking on a difficult day at work, challenges with their boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question often enables the other person to open up and share how they feel about this challenging moment. This also allows you to empathize, rather than reflexively jump into problem-solving mode, which inadvertently overpowers their need to be understood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=what-results-did-i-produce-today&gt;"What results did I produce today?"&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a question I try to ask at the end of every day. Many times, the answer will be blank. Other times, there will be a list of several items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this question is valuable is that it reframes the mind to think about what you produced rather than what you spent time on. Ultimately, the results you produce towards the direction of your goals is far more important than endless lists of low-yield tasks that we you may have kept yourself busy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question forces you to contemplate: did I prioritize effectively? did I focus on the things that move the needle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer isn't impressive on most days, but the process of asking myself this question allows me to calibrate my priorities and assess the output of each day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=how-am-i-supposed-to-do-that&gt;"How am I supposed to do that?"&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered this one from Chris Voss's book - Never Split the Difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone asks you to do something that you don't feel inclined to, or would propose a challenge to you, the use of this question immediately invites the other person to think about how to solve this problem from your vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that your workplace superior asks you to deliver a project earlier than the pre-arranged deadline. Instead of saying "no" or finding a way to decline, which is likely to create friction, deploy this question.

    <title>The Tyranny of 'Weekend Plans'</title>

&lt;em&gt;“What are your plans this weekend?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I sit in my barber's chair near the end of the week, I brace myself. As he starts trimming, I know this dread question is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel a slight twinge of annoyance, not because I lack plans, but because I know my answer won't satisfy his unspoken expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I explain that I'll be spending three hours in reflective journaling, evaluating if I've lived up to my values this week? Or consolidating insights from neglected books and newsletters? Should I mention the extended workout and sauna session, or the time I've set aside to refine my latest business idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I can see their eyes glazing over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I find myself in a situation similar to ordering at Starbucks with a unique name. You know the drill - to avoid the hassle of explanations and misspellings, you give a simpler 'Starbucks name.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, my 'Starbucks name' for weekend plans is, "Just catching up on things."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mumble my usual response and watch his reflection in the mirror, seeing a flicker of... something. Disappointment? Boredom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I've failed to meet the arbitrary criteria for an 'exciting' weekend. He is usually expecting to hear about wild parties or Instagram-worthy adventures; something easily categorized as 'fun'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems like a great conversation starter is a lazy question that fakes genuine interest and expects a limited range of responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this innocent question about weekend plans often provoke irritation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably because it's not just casual conversation. It feels like a social evaluation tool. It reflects a myopic value system that I don't subscribe to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-askers-assumptions-and-hidden-agenda&gt;The Asker's Assumptions and Hidden Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This innocent inquiry assumes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weekends are solely for leisure and socializing. It often disregards those who use this time for personal growth, side hustles, or simply recharging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Plans' are concrete, easily explained activities that are socially acceptable and digestible (i.e., going to the cottage, attending a wedding, going to a ball game).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A boundary between "work" and weekend, ignoring the blurred lines for entrepreneurs, creatives, or anyone pursuing projects outside the 9-to-5 grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about those of us who don't fit into these neat little boxes? What about those of us who see weekends as opportunities for personal growth, reflection, or pursuing endeavours that don't translate well into small talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inquiry frequently presumes that most of us spend our weekdays in "uninteresting" work purgatory, making weekends our only chance for a jailbreak into "interesting" territory. The asker unconsciously projects their work-life dichotomy onto you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who don't compartmentalize our lives this way, this question becomes a frustrating social evaluation, with the asker gauging whether you're 'fun' or 'boring' based on arbitrary criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's not forget the hidden motives. Often, the asker is just waiting to share their own 'exciting' plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gym trainer once asked me about my weekend plans on a Thursday. As I fumbled a vague response, I saw her barely containing her excitement. She wanted a quick, uninteresting reply so she could share her news. Sure enough, she couldn't wait to tell me, "Oh, that's nice. I'm flying to Vancouver for the Metallica concert!" It's small talk masquerading as genuine interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question puts me in an uncomfortable position. Do we lie to meet their expectations? Do we give a sanitized version of our true plans? Or do we bother being honest and see them lose interest?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-answerers-dilemma&gt;The Answerer's Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here I am, cornered by this question, feeling the pressure of societal expectations. What am I supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Answerer's Dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining my weekend plans is like trying to summarize the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a 30-second elevator ride. It's a futile exercise that does a disservice to the nuances of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the tedium...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those with consistent weekend routines focused on personal growth, explaining our plans becomes as repetitive as my barber asking if I want "the usual."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm still journaling and contemplating on my Saturday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I haven't taken up skydiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a language barrier here, and it's not about vocabulary.
How do you dense diverse, deeply personal and often intangible activities pursuits into small-talk-friendly nuggets. How do you explain that you're "working on yourself" without sounding like you've swallowed a self-help book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world obsessed with productivity and visible achievements, how do you convey the value of simply... being? Of allowing your mind to wander, to make unexpected connections, to recharge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm planning to stare at the ceiling for a few hours and see what ideas pop up" isn't usually what the asker is expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, weekends aren't an escape from the 'real world'. They're an integral part of my growth and self-discovery. My ideal weekend includes reflective journaling, diving into books and newsletters, an extended workout session doubling as moving meditation, writing and refining business ideas or creative projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Working on myself" encompasses a myriad of activities that society might not deem interesting or worthwhile, but are important to my journey. They don't fit neatly into the "fun plans" box that the weekend question assumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when faced with the weekend question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we simplify our rich internal lives into palatable sound bites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we risk being misunderstood or dismissed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we risk being genuine, even if it bores others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a delicate dance that requires balancing authenticity with social grace, depth with brevity, self-respect with respect for others' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I wish I could respond with, "I'm planning to exist intensely. How about you?"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=bridging-the-gap-to-answer-or-not-to-answer&gt;Bridging the Gap: To Answer or Not to Answer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've established that this question is a social Pandora's box. But let's not get too dramatic - we're talking about weekend plans, not addressing a global crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it's worth examining the implications of this query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guilt Trip:&lt;/em&gt; Sometimes, when I'm deep into a personal project or enjoying a quiet weekend, this question makes me feel like I should be out there skydiving or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Connection Conundrum:&lt;/em&gt; Sometimes I'm eager to share my latest existential revelation or the fascinating book I'm reading. But most people asking about weekend plans aren't ready for a TED talk on the nature of consciousness. It's like bringing a philosophy textbook to a cocktail party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Communication Breakdown:&lt;/em&gt; Maybe the problem isn't the question, but my answer. Perhaps I need to translate "I'm exploring the depths of my psyche" into "I'm doing some personal development stuff." It's not lying; it's social shorthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These responses highlight a clash between a society that values easily digestible experiences and those of us who find meaning in the nuanced, the abstract, the ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we're not social misfits for valuing introspection over Instagram-worthy adventures. We're just playing a different game, one where the scoreboard isn't visible to the casual observer.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=where-does-this-leave-us&gt;Where does this leave us?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're asking about weekend plans, reflect on your motivations: Are you eager to share your own plans, genuinely curious about the other person's life, or using it to evaluate them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider more engaging ways to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's been on your mind lately?" or "What are you looking forward to?" could lead to more interesting conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for those of us on the receiving end, I started treating it as an invitation to overshare. I'll joke, "You asked, so now you're getting a TED talk on my latest existential crisis." Or, I'll try something like, "I'm embarking on an expedition into my psyche. Want to hear about it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, we don't have to play by rules that don't serve us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I unexpectedly beat my personal running record, wrote this essay, and had an emotional conversation with an old friend about her upcoming wedding challenges. None of this would fit neatly into a 'What are your plans?' response, but it was satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I've found this dreaded question to be an excellent filter for meaningful connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those rare individuals who show genuine interest in my 'boring' weekend plans become my most valued friends and collaborators. The question has become an unexpected litmus test for compatibility in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a challenge: For the next month, ban 'What are your plans?' from your vocabulary. Instead, use 'What are you looking forward to?' or 'What's been on your mind lately?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might end up in a conversation about the nature of existence, or learn too much about someone's sourdough starter. Either way, you're likely to have more authentic and engaging interactions.

    <title>Beyond Good Intentions: Reclaiming The Lost Art of Keeping Your Word</title>
    <updated>2025-12-14T17:39:15.046746+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There’s a specific kind of silence that doesn’t just disappoint you. It betrays you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first it’s ordinary. You’re at a table. The room is alive. You’re scrolling, half-present, telling yourself they’re parking, or stuck, or texting back any second. You still believe the empty chair is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the minutes pile up and your nervous system starts doing math you didn’t ask it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You stop checking the time and start checking yourself:
Did I misunderstand? Did I get the day wrong? Did I assume too much?
And in the middle of that spiral, the real insult lands. Not that they didn’t show up, but that they didn’t even bother to manage your expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No call. No text. No “I’m running late.” Just silence and the hollow echo of another broken promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And absence is never neutral. Absence communicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now flip the setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re in a coffee shop with a document you’ve bled into. Weeks of thinking, writing, refining, trimming the fat, tightening the argument, trying to make the case so clear that a distracted stranger could’t miss the point. You finally meet the person who told you, repeatedly, that they were “so excited,” that they’d “gone through everything,” that they’d “come prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they start talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And within sixty seconds it’s obvious: they didn’t read a single page. They’re reacting to the idea of what you sent, not what you actually wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t dramatic crimes. No one is getting sued. No one is getting stabbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they’re not “small,” either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insult is the assumption that you can carry the weight of their unpreparedness without complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where words pour out effortlessly: “for sure,” “absolutely,” “I’ve got you,” “I’ll do it tonight”, follow-through has become the scarce commodity. And scarcity is what gives something value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lately, a lot of people are running a deficit.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-excuse-graveyard-burying-the-reasons-we-use-to-dodge-accountability&gt;The Excuse Graveyard: Burying the 'Reasons' We Use To Dodge Accountability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excuses are rarely meant to explain. They’re meant to soften the speaker’s landing and keep the social surface smooth. But smooth surfaces can hide rot. Let’s shovel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I forgot":  In a world where your phone remembers the weather, your boarding gate, and the exact moment you should stand up so your spine doesn’t fossilize, “I forgot” isn’t an excuse. It’s you admitting you didn’t build even the simplest system to protect what you claimed mattered. If it matters, it gets captured. If it doesn’t, it floats. And floating promises drift exactly the way you’d expect: away from effort, away from inconvenience, away from the moment they become real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I got busy": Busy is not an exception. Busy is the background radiation of adult life. So when you say “I got busy,” what you’re really saying is: when life asked me to choose, you lost the vote. Follow-through is about the hierarchy of your priorities, and whether your mouth keeps writing checks your calendar can’t cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Something came up": Sometimes it does. Real emergencies exist.
The kind of thing that makes you drop everything and run. But most of the time this phrase is a fog machine. It creates ambiguity so you don’t have to look directly at the truth: You didn’t plan. You didn’t buffer. You didn’t respect the commitment enough to build protection around it. So the first gust of friction knocked it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I meant to, but...": Intentions are the participation trophies of adulthood. They feel good to hold. They don’t win anything. “I meant to” is what you say when you want credit for the internal version of yourself — the one who did the thing flawlessly in your imagination — while the external version of you did nothing. If you meant to, you would have moved it from thought to calendar to action. These aren’t reasons. They’re sedatives.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-ripple-effect-of-broken-promises&gt;The Ripple Effect of Broken Promises&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every broken promise leaves behind two kinds of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious damage is practical: the meeting didn’t happen, the project stalled, the plan got wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real damage is invisible: it changes what the other person believes about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust doesn’t collapse like a building imploding on the news. It erodes like muscle loss; slow enough to ignore until you suddenly can’t do what used to feel easy.  ￼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what keeps happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust Erosion:&lt;/strong&gt; Every unfulfilled commitment whispers, "You can't count on me," gradually transforming solid relationships into fragile, uncertain connections. Eventually they stop building plans that require your presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Debt:&lt;/strong&gt; Disappointment accumulates interest. The first time is a shrug. The third time is irritation. The tenth time is resentment in a nice outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Evaporation:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic promise-breakers don’t always get confronted. They get excluded. With quiet edits. Your name stops appearing in group plans. Your invitation arrives later, if at all. People stop asking because asking becomes a form of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reputation Tax:&lt;/strong&gt; Professionally, poor follow-through makes you expensive. Not in money, but in risk. People stop giving you fragile opportunities: the ones that could become partnerships, introductions, second chances. Because we can’t afford the uncertainty attached to your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Respect Corrosion:&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s the part that should scare you even if you don’t care about anyone else. Every time you break your own promises, you train yourself that your word is negotiable. You become a person who can’t even rely on you.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=the-disrespect-factor&gt;The Disrespect Factor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who fail to follow through aren’t trying to be disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But impact doesn’t ask permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you don’t follow through, the message that lands isn’t, “I was overwhelmed.”
It’s: “Your time and feelings were optional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why it cuts. Because it’s not just inconvenience. It’s valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s something uniquely damaging about passive disrespect; the kind where you can hurt someone and still tell yourself you’re a good person because you didn’t “intend” to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent doesn’t heal damage. Consistency does.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=why-its-worse-in-personal-life&gt;Why It's Worse In Personal Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work punishes unreliability quickly. It has teeth. Deadlines bite. Money disappears. People replace you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal relationships don’t come with immediate penalties. There’s no HR department for friendships. No quarterly review for being a flaky partner. These relationships don't invoice you immediately. They let you run a tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But delayed costs don’t disappear. They compound. They accumulate like plaque in an artery: silent until suddenly catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the most dangerous belief of all pours gasoline on this: “They’ll understand," "it's not a bid deal," "we're close, it's fine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends and family do understand. That’s why they forgive you at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the fifth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until “understanding” hardens into a conclusion: This is who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because the consequences are delayed, people mistake “no immediate blow-up” for “no damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when the relationship starts living on life support and dies in resignation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=reclaiming-the-art-of-follow-through&gt;Reclaiming the Art of Follow-Through&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most advice on this topic is shallow: “use a calendar,” “set reminders,” “manage your time.” That treats follow-through like an organizational problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a honesty problem. Because the real failure usually happens earlier—at the moment you say yes when you don’t actually mean yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are the rules that matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop using “yes” as social lubricant:&lt;/strong&gt; Most broken promises begin with a cowardly yes — the kind you say because you want to be liked in the moment in the service of image management. But dirty 'yes' is a slow betrayal; counterfeit. A clean 'no' is respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it matters, it enters a system that outlives your mood:&lt;/strong&gt; Assign specific time slots to your commitments. Calendar. Reminder. Note. Whatever. Don’t just schedule it. Treat it like an appointment with consequences. Because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 24-hour promise rule:&lt;/strong&gt; If overcommitting is your default, stop making same-day promises. Give yourself a day for the dopamine to fade and reality to speak. Enthusiasm is not capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renegotiate early, not late:&lt;/strong&gt; If you can’t follow through, say it early. Not after they’ve already waited at the restaurant. Not after they’ve already cleared their evening. Early communication is what respect looks like in motion: you’re not perfect, but you’re accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the ripple effect:&lt;/strong&gt; That missed coffee might have been the one hour your friend was counting on to feel less alone. That unread proposal might have been weeks of someone else’s effort treated like background noise; and a quiet decision that you’re not someone they’ll build with again. Small acts aren’t small when they repeat. Repetition is destiny in disguise.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=from-i-will-to-i-did&gt;From "I Will" to "I Did"&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you keep breaking promises, the issue isn’t that you’re busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s that you’re comfortable letting other people absorb the cost of your comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get to feel like a good person because you “meant well,” while they’re left holding the messy reality: the wasted time, the awkward waiting, the private embarrassment of having believed you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t keep small promises, stop asking for big intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where words are cheap and promises are often decorative, be the person whose actions stay in lockstep with their mouth. Be the friend who arrives. The partner who reads the thing. The person whose yes has weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the journey from “I will” to “I did” isn’t just about keeping promises. It’s how you become someone whose name doesn’t come with an asterisk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <title>3 Unorthodox Topics I'm Unpacking</title>
    <updated>2025-01-15T00:26:25.900189+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are 3 topics that I am actively thinking about a lot these days:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=topic-1-unlocking-value-in-whatsapp-niche-communities&gt;Topic #1: Unlocking value in WhatsApp niche communities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Marc Andreessen (co-founder of a16z) emphasized the importance of niche communities and how platforms like WhatsApp can facilitate small groups of domain experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreessen suggests that these small groups (5-10 people) of highly knowledgeable individuals in a specific field (e.g., venture capital, medicine, fitness) can enhance knowledge sharing and foster high-quality discussions around important problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to carefully curate the group, ensuring that all members are true domain experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating niche topic groups can serve as a valuable incubator for in-depth exploration. While I believe this is a clever idea, I currently lack the necessary domain experts to seed such a group within my network. To address this, I need to invest more effort into expanding the quality and diversity of my network, which leads to the next topic.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=topic-2-the-importance-of-diverse-nodes-in-building-an-impactful-network&gt;Topic #2: The importance of diverse nodes in building an impactful network&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While curating niche groups is valuable, it’s even more important to expand our networks strategically. But, with limited time and bandwidth, what does an evidence-based networking strategy look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973, Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter provided insights with his seminal paper, &lt;a href='https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2023/07/strength-weak-ties'&gt;"The Strength of Weak Ties"&lt;/a&gt;. His research revealed a counterintuitive finding: acquaintances (weak ties) often prove more valuable than close friends (strong ties) when seeking new opportunities, such as jobs or life partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key insights from Granovetter's work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dense networks: Close friends and colleagues share significant network overlap, limiting exposure to novel information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information saturation: Within dense networks, valuable opportunities are quickly disseminated, leaving little room for new discoveries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tie strength and career progression: Weak ties excel at facilitating job changes, while strong ties better support advancement within a current role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this to a networking strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're an accountant seeking to expand your professional horizons. Rather than strengthening connections within your existing financial circle, you would benefit more from cultivating relationships with individuals in diverse fields – an apparel business owner, a hedge fund trader, or a research scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These weak ties serve as bridges to entirely new networks, exponentially increasing your access to novel information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway? Prioritize building a diverse network of weak ties over strengthening existing strong ties. By focusing on second or third-degree connections, you position yourself at the intersection of multiple diverse networks, maximizing your exposure to emerging prospects.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=topic-3-navigating-relationship-expectations-with-anti-goals&gt;Topic #3: Navigating relationship expectations with anti-goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/power-anti-goals-andrew-wilkinson/'&gt;Anti-goals&lt;/a&gt; offer a fresh perspective on decision-making by focusing on what to avoid rather than what to achieve. This approach is particularly valuable when positive goals are challenging to define, as identifying undesirable outcomes is often more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's illustrate this concept with an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're hiring a CFO for your company. While discussing traditional goals is important, exploring potential negative outcomes can be equally illuminating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would make the job unbearable for the CFO?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might the working relationship deteriorate over time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What situations could lead to misalignment or conflict?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By addressing these "anti-goals," you proactively develop strategies to prevent negative outcomes and create a more robust working relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of reverse thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk mitigation: Anticipate and address potential issues before they arise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced decision-making: Consider a broader range of outcomes for more informed choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding hidden pitfalls: Uncover unforeseen downsides that might be overlooked when focusing solely on positive goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying anti-goals in both personal and professional contexts leads to more comprehensive planning and improved outcomes. For instance, when entering a business partnership, prioritize defining the relationship dynamics you want to avoid. Then, collaborate on strategies to prevent these scenarios, reducing their likelihood and improving your ability to manage them if they do occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By incorporating anti-goals into your decision-making process, you create a more balanced and realistic approach to achieving success in your relationships and endeavours.

    <title>I'm Not Sure That I Like Writing. But, I'm Sure That I Must.</title>
    <updated>2025-01-15T00:26:16.517859+00:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>tkhan</name>
      <email>hidden</email>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The moment I accepted that no one may ever read my writing was the moment I finally began to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I doubted anyone would read my work. And if no one reads it, then why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doubt kept my fingers off the keyboard and my thoughts trapped in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era of AI-generated content, adding my voice seemed futile. Why start now when AI is churning out infinite content? That seems foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality writing takes time. If no one reads my &lt;a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30556551-nobody-wants-to-read-your-sh-t'&gt;sh*t&lt;/a&gt;, and there's no scarcity of written content, what's the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I had a realization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worthwhile writing doesn’t have to dazzle millions of readers or build a massive following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, that would be nice. It's probably a worthy goal. But it's also daunting and creates a lot of pressure to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer something unique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a niche&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish on a consistent schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate based on engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what if I focus on writing for myself? What if it's about something more personal, more transformative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, those reservations don't hold as much weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying they disappear completely. I am human, and I have some desire to be validated, understood, and admired. But, it's not the main point anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I uncovered was simpler, yet unexpectedly liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how I discovered the power of writing for an audience of one - myself. It led me to distill my decision to start writing into four reasons.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=1-writing-exposes-flaws-in-our-thinking-by-forcing-us-to-organize-chaotic-thoughts-into-coherent-ideas&gt;1. Writing exposes flaws in our thinking by forcing us to organize chaotic thoughts into coherent ideas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate lie detector for your thoughts is clear writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekly, I absorb various media—essays, podcasts, and books—that blend in my mind, creating a rich but chaotic mix of ideas. This fusion sparks intriguing thoughts, nudging me closer to fundamental truths, albeit in a disorganized manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without an outlet to process and synthesize these inputs, my thinking remains fragmented and opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing forces me to de-convolute these ideas, clarifying my perspective and exposing the true depth (or lack thereof) of my understanding. It transforms the tangled mess in my mind into clearer, coherent insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to convince myself that I "get" an idea when it's just a hazy impression. But when forced to express it in writing, the weaknesses become  apparent. Sloppy logic, unsubstantiated assumptions, and contradictory beliefs are laid bare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear, concise writing reflects clear thinking. It’s the ultimate litmus test for quality of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you understand an idea? You write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing silences the chaos in my mind and manages my relentless internal dialogue. It untangles crowded mental clutter and preserves my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, it becomes both a mirror and a chisel for our thoughts - reflecting their present state and shaping them into something more refined. It's not about transcribing pre-formed thoughts. It's about actively sculpting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is not just a way to convey ideas, but also a way to have them. A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing…There is a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently sat down to write a business proposal for an idea I'd been mulling over. I say 'grudgingly' because, let's be frank, who enjoys writing business plans? They seemed like a pointless exercise to pretend you know more about your business than you actually do, only to be proven wrong when you start executing the 'plan'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I started writing, something unexpected happened. The vague, exciting idea in my head began to crumble under the weight of specifics demanded by the proposal. Questions I'd been ignoring demanded answers. It was frustrating and uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a week after finishing this 'final' 30-page document, my perspective shifted. New ideas bubbled up. Connections I hadn't seen before became clear. Suddenly, large chunks of my proposal felt outdated, even misguided. I shifted the business plan entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I was annoyed. Was all that work for nothing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized - this was the point. The value wasn't in the document, but in the mental gymnastics it forced me to endure. It pushed my thinking further and faster than endless 'brainstorming' could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my original proposal now gathers digital dust, the exercise was far from futile. It propelled my business idea forward, exposing flaws and sparking innovations I might have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does this happen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the correct answer, but I can offer a hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing forces us to slow down. When we try to put words to paper, we're confronted with the reality that our ideas aren't as coherent as we thought. That we don't really understand them deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struggle of articulating our thoughts forces us to question our assumptions, make new connections, and ultimately, understand our ideas more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paul Graham &lt;a href='https://paulgraham.com/read.html'&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without writing…If you're thinking about how two pieces of machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't help much. But if you need to solve a complicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to write about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at writing will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such problems. People who just want information may find other ways to get it. But people who want to have ideas can't afford to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept can be summarized as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t write because I think. I write so that I can think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing forces clarity and ideas, but its benefits don’t end there. The act of putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) is also a powerful tool for learning and retention.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=2-writing-reinforces-knowledge-through-spaced-repetition&gt;2. Writing reinforces knowledge through spaced repetition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often have you finished a book, essay, newsletter, or podcast feeling inspired with newfound epiphany, only to struggle recalling its key points a week later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much of it leads to transformative changes in behaviour or decision-making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a frustrating cycle: read, get excited, do nothing, forget, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a knowledge junkie. Now, I'm in recovery. I wasted years fooling myself into thinking I was learning, when I was just consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I voraciously consumed information from books, podcasts, and newsletters. After finishing each piece, I'd feel like I had unlocked some profound wisdom. "This is it," I'd think, "This is the insight I've been looking for." But... nothing would change. The "revelations" that seemed so transformative would slip away, leaving me with vague impressions at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth is that we fool ourselves into thinking we're learning when we're merely consuming. It's easy, enjoyable, and gives us the illusion of progress. We feel smart and informed. But are we really learning if our behaviour and thinking remain unchanged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real learning demands active engagement, deep reflection, and application. Most of us falter there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because it's hard work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easier to highlight a passage in a book or nod along to a podcast than to wrestle with how these ideas apply to our lives. Writing about what we've learned, articulating it in our own words, considering its implications – that's effortful, time-consuming, and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this effort, we're fooling ourselves. We're mistaking information for knowledge and confusing exposure for insight. We're filling our heads with ideas that never lead to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is not just a transcription tool. It is a catalyst that forces us to slow down and engage with the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumption of ideas&lt;/strong&gt; (via essays, podcasts, books)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflection&lt;/strong&gt; (First Exposure)&lt;br /&gt;
a. Initial formation of understanding, ideas begin to take shape, new ones emerge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing&lt;/strong&gt; (Second Exposure)&lt;br /&gt;
a. Organizing, contemplating, and articulating thoughts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved clarity&lt;/strong&gt; (Third Exposure)&lt;br /&gt;
a. Thoughts de-convolute, ideas become clearer, better understanding of concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing&lt;/strong&gt; (Multiple Exposures)&lt;br /&gt;
a. First Revision → Second Revision → Third Revision…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing/Discussing&lt;/strong&gt; (Additional Exposure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deeper Understanding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
a. As ideas clarify, the quality of our decisions improves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process creates spaced repetition. Each step provides a new opportunity to engage with and deepen understanding of the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insight was inspired by David Perell's essay 'Against 3x Speed,' which highlights how writing creates multiple exposures to information, enhancing understanding and retention. Building on Perell's idea, I've found that this process creates a powerful learning cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You encounter an idea when you first read it, then reflect on it, organize it in your mind, and write about it. Each engagement deepens your understanding and strengthens memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process isn't always smooth or enjoyable, but the struggle creates the opportunity for consolidation. It also creates a tangible record of our  journey, letting us revisit ideas and track our evolving thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I read, I force myself to write down the key ideas, how they connect to what I already know, and how they might change my approach to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's less immediately gratifying than breezing through another book or podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I don’t know a better way. The goal is to actually learn and remember, not to fool myself into believing that learning has taken place when it hasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning isn’t linear, but fragmented. There are many side thoughts and threads that lead away from your main subject, either pointing nowhere or looping back to give you clarity and context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As David Perell puts it, writing becomes both a test and a tool for deeper comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its cognitive benefits, writing satisfies a fundamental need...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=3-the-urge-to-create&gt;3. The urge to create&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The act of creation is powerful, and for me, writing satisfies this itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codie Sanchez puts it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bliss isn't found in drugs or excess, in sex, in escaping...it's found in creating. Once you've tasted that drug, nothing else will satisfy you. You'll be a hunter in search of your prey. Everything else is a shiny distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creation is the essence of our existence, whether through writing, coding, engineering, or any other expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this creative impulse manifests in two forms: photography and writing. Both are tools for capturing and expressing my perspective, but they serve complementary purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography trains my eye to notice overlooked details, freezing fleeting moments into visual stories. Through the lens, I interpret the tangible world, saying “this is what I find interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing sharpens my ability to spot connections in my thoughts. It's a medium for capturing and expressing the intangible - ideas, concepts, and insights that can't be photographed. Where my camera freezes physical moments, my writing crystallizes abstract thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both push me to be more present and observant, engaging with my surroundings and inner landscape with intentionality. Whether behind the lens or at the keyboard, I'm satisfying the same creative itch - not just passively consuming, but actively shaping, interpreting, and creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating provides a unique gratification that's hard to replicate. It's a form of self-expression that goes beyond mere documentation – it's an interpretation, a way of saying "this is how I see things."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography has trained my eye to notice details and compositions I might overlook, while writing forces me to organize my thoughts and see connections I might have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creative impulse extends beyond writing and photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm probably drawn to entrepreneurial pursuits for similar reasons. It's another avenue for creating something that reflects my viewpoint, sharing it, and ideally providing value. There's a profound satisfaction in owning your creation, be it a business, a piece of writing, or a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to the question: why not just privately journal? Why publish online?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=4-writing-increases-the-surface-area-for-serendipity&gt;4. Writing increases the surface area for serendipity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personal benefits of writing are significant, but there's a compelling reason to share our work publicly: it increases opportunities for serendipitous connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a noisy world, I write to signal my wavelength to those who might be listening. I do this not to reach everyone, but to attract the few who resonate with my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While private journaling has its merits, publishing online creates more opportunities. There are many reasons to share your writing publicly - building an audience and growing a side-business are common ones. While I have those aspirations, my primary motivation is to increase the surface area for serendipitous connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “Show Your Work,” Austin Kleon argues that an “artist” doesn’t need to self-promote, but create conditions for their work to be findable. The best approach is to generously share your work and process, especially since it is easily doable for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not an artist, but I believe in the value of sharing one's process. This aligns with the "build in public" approach some entrepreneurs adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It involves revealing my thoughts, deliberations, and how I navigate problems. This transparency is more valuable than past achievements or experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Chen, a partner at a16z, published a fantastic &lt;a href='https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/10x-work-versus-1x-work?r=fdli9&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true'&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; advocating for creating assets that spread over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find leverage. Create work assets that compound over time so that it spreads even when you sleep. Maybe this is a project you’ve put out into the world, and customers can find it and share it. Or it’s a series of videos or essays that grow in audience over time, and each new bit content builds upon the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same approach that let Andrew Chen be discovered by Marc Andreessen and land a partnership at a16z in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved to the Bay Area in 2007, as a first-time founder with a lot of energy and a lot of questions. I spent the first year meeting everyone I could, reading everything about tech, and writing down all that I was learning. A few months in, I was shocked to get a cold email from Marc introducing himself. Who knew that sort of thing happened? My blog was pretty much anonymous and I could be anyone – but he reached out to talk ideas, which made a big impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aspire to build businesses and capitalize on niche opportunities at the frontiers of innovation - areas that are often hidden and evolving. By sharing my work and thought processes online, I'm not just documenting my journey. I'm creating opportunities for unexpected connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a way to attract like-minded individuals who can push my thinking, potential collaborators for future ventures, and insights into emerging opportunities I might not otherwise discover.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=where-does-that-leave-me&gt;Where does that leave me?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the aforementioned reasons, I must admit, there is always some level of ego-driven need to share and be understood. Knowing that everything I share is subject to public scrutiny leaves little room to hide will force me to understand things well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have outlined some expectations for myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will document my thoughts and decisions for my future self — a curious but forgetful reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hope others will find it useful or entertaining, but the intended audience is my future self.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will avoid sounding preachy, though my writing may sometimes have that tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My public writings will serve as a record of my thoughts, observations, and processes, capturing my approach to life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I aim to deliver maximum understanding and impact with the fewest words, achieving the highest return per word.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrary to popular belief, this is more of an exercise in critical thinking than linguistic acrobatics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to be held accountable for one expectation, above all else: I will write to clarify and be useful, not to sound smart.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may fall into this trap, but I invite the reader to call me out on any transgressions when that occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These expectations set a high bar, and I acknowledge that meeting them consistently will be challenging. As Nat Eliason points out in his &lt;a href='https://blog.nateliason.com/p/reasonably-hard-on-yourself'&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; "How To Be Reasonably Hard on Yourself," improvement in writing is often incremental and requires embracing imperfection. This resonates with my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably never be satisfied with anything I publish. There will always be a nagging feeling that "this could be better." However, this is true for all creative endeavours. There's no such thing as a flawless work; at some point, we must declare it "good enough" and release it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing will force me to confront this discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to keep my work confined to private memos, deeming it unworthy for the public sphere. Yet, I want to become more comfortable with the inevitable feeling of inadequacy, accepting that each piece is "good enough" for now, knowing the next will be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't always enjoy the process, but I've come to see writing as an indispensable tool for transforming convoluted thinking into actionable insights. It's not merely a task to enjoy or dislike, but a necessity that enables me to make sense of the world and my place in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a discipline I'm open to embrace.
