GOJO: It takes a curse to defeat a curse. More specifically, it takes a curse of the same kind to counter a curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/swanchime/screenshot_20260206_054443.webp" alt="Screenshot_20260206_054443" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAKI: It's the curse's fault? Your face is screaming, "I'm a good person." How disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the person that gets protected get away with acting like the victim?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've only lived your life with the flow, passively receiving the current of events to come. But the Jujutsu Institute isn't a place you can keep up that spoiled attitude where you can live aimlessly, without purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TW: cops, police brutality, killing, suicide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think art should have soul and meaning and exist beyond the plastic mechanical perfection of technique and saying smth you truly mean is more potent and important than making a carbon-copy of a Proper Technique done "the right way" when a facsimile / replica of smth that once meant smth may Look superficially similar... but lacks substance and fulfillment completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at the drawing club today a woman that works for the "public defenders department" (lawyers for poor ppl paid to be incompetent) said her coworker got murdered by an off-duty cop who shot her 6-8 times like it was just gossip and not particularly interesting gossip at that, and only vaguely and insincerely apologizing for the "bringing down the mood" but implicitly blaming me for asking...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the people who can listen to the death of a woman at the hands of a cop with no change in expression other than mildly interesting dull work gossip have no love in their hearts and the art they make will be completely and utterly devoid of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate the artists that esteem themselves The Most Traumatized (False) Kings Lords And Princesses (GODS) but even their little petty worlds of self-worship have more to say than ordinary salaried office workers who can't even bring themselves to pretend life death and even Violent Killing Deaths are anything other than a vaguely interesting apathetic tidbit from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;("oh, there would be more cops who murder off the clock if there were more cops, you only hear about a few because there's more not cops than cops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I want to talk to people who care about violence and responsibility and living like life is worth dying for and who make "art" about it. but I think instead of art these people make suicide notes no one looks at and then they die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/swanchime/screenshot_20251213_065555_kindle-1.webp" alt="Screenshot_20251213_065555_Kindle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think for me when I read hnk, it was full of regret FOR having thought humanity may be annihilated down to the smallest grain of bone and having been driven to believe humanity is irredeemable bc of the way author retrospectively re-humanizes every one of his victims down to the interiority of the child made a bride kept like a happy canary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;who was manipulated to abandon him SPECIFICALLY to isolate him BECAUSE she could have stabilized him and prevented the gem massacre. I think hnk author no longer believes humanity is irredeemable BUT committed betrayal and atrocity in the past due to having once believed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but if the author still believed it, there would be a lone planet of desolation so suffocating that the god phos would have been a black hole imploding instead of friendship and deep loyalty (the eye robot and children rocks went back for phos despite him telling them to abandon him to die)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and there would have been no retrospective seeing it didn't have to come to this (the way the gems said phos is better off a slug) (cinnabar blushing and saying if you wanted to pair up... (I would be happy to)) (seeing in horrifying glamorous clarity the child bride plucked so phos would have no stabilizing factor And understanding replicating a perfect imagination of this child's effusive complete devotion trust and joy bc even the man says "because you have a psychological disorder" (so I exploited very iota of it)) just like, if the author still believed there's nothing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in humanity that is redeeming or lovable then his human friends would not have been written with countless opportunities of regret and understanding instead of cruelty and abject condemnation even when writing a record of his own actions step by step until he lost himself and committed a massacre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bc he even says at some point. to euch the gem that wants to make peace. it's too late to go back, I have to see it through. and there would be no moments of gem joy and friendship and acceptance for cinnabar and no even sensei being called by name and loved by children and no criticism of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"why do you just believe what the lunarians say is true?" I feel like hnk is resplendent with self-guilt, regret, wishing, and a reverse humanization of all the gems that had abandoned phos and helped drive him to orchestrate the ultimate annihilation and betrayal, But I think the author once did think there was nothing in humanity that could be cherished and adored without ultimate ugliness beyond it. (the canary.) but I think he sees now that his annihilation of all human beings WASN'T inevitable and could have been stopped if only stupid phos was wise enough to reach for cinnas hand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or yama's hands behind the scenes weren't pulling his heartstrings like a puppeteer to deliberately isolate and intentionally drive him to this. he understands human beings drove him to atrocity, BUT he also understands that there were many opportunities to stop it, though it isn't until the end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that he experiences the loyalty of children and scrap metal servants that talk like vermin bums and he finally understands there's more to humanity than the atrocity he was driven to commit. he understands that the loyalty of children exists, AND implied is that one day the children will grow up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/swanchime/psx_20251213_072442.webp" alt="PSX_20251213_072442" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/swanchime/psx_20251213_072506.webp" alt="PSX_20251213_072506" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/swanchime/psx_20251213_072518.webp" alt="PSX_20251213_072518" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/swanchime/psx_20251213_072541.webp" alt="PSX_20251213_072541" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and when the children who were allowed to sing and play grow up there will be human beings again someday, with complex human hearts, and even phos can say now and here there were those among humans with good hearts, and that's why humans should be known about to children (who should be protected)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ending is a field of flourishing baby gems (bc phos cracked when he made contact) and a ray of hope when he hears the words of the children around him and just. I think that the ending is full of hope for the next generation (of human beings) to grow where they are protecting each other n loyal and playing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's more than a contextual kernel of hope with an overarching belief in irredeemable evil bc phos, the atrocity god and evil star, was redeemed at the end and changed his stance on if all humanity should die forever including himself. ploop the eyeball only looks like that, not to represent how disgusting human beings are, but to represent a jovial and vermin slang causal bum and severely disfigured man, because his personality and behavior is the warmest in the entire series, and he is the one who goes back for phos who told him to leave him behind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hnk would have been like. oyasumi punpun. or at the very least, not beautiful. it would have been ugly or ended on cold minimalist annihilation vacuum of space hopeless alone on a desolation star until he turned to dust, it could have EASILY been that. but I think instead it bears the sum of regret for having been driven to becoming an atrocity god that committed a massacre forced to believe nothing is left. to understanding it never had to come to that, it was made to (yama), or the opportunities were missed (cinnabar), and it was kongo and not ploop who was sensei even tho they're brothers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I think it is full of guilt and regret and human love and understanding for killed peers and companions raised in the same buddhist cult bc it imagines all of their interiorities and there's a self-exposure and violent self-condemnation in the body horror depictions of phos barely recognizable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and abjectly monstrous while also understanding he was driven to this, made that way, AND the one person who would not have looked away was remolded into a pet, and it was increasingly and increasingly too late / there was no "changing or going back"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I think hnk is full of regret for having once believed in the necessity of human annihilation and ultimately harbors love and hope that the next gems to be / that phos this time won't be like the planet (reincarnation cycle) it was before. it would look More like berserk or junji ito in style&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instead of something wretched and divine and beautiful, above all things, because it believes there's still beauty in the world... I think hnk author Did once believe the things you despise about it. but I think it's framed as exposing the regrets of a past self who committed atrocity bc he believed and was encouraged and driven to believe it was true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT it is not true, there is hope and beauty and worth in the world and the people to abide by these tenets most loyally are not like the man-prince yama but like the disfigured scrap flesh maimed bum eye brother of a respectable monk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and children who don't see him as an atrocity god but as a wise playmate they cherish. with the understanding children grow up to be human beings. but what if these children were cherished and allowed to play and sing from birth... what kind of humanity would that create? things can be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the end is the belief humanity is not hopeless. it can change. no children have to become phos. it is not inevitable, nor was it necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;is humanity defined "against" those who are (in)human/e or(non-)human? what does it take to make someone "no longer human"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i'm still haunted by that one game dev who treated me like filth on the bottom of his shoe because in my heart i felt such resonance and HOPE, a rare and sightless hope, maybe because i was closing my eyes, just a glimmer of light and excitement for art in the fog...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you want to curbstomp me so bad you don't have to be polite about it. but you think better of yourself for being polite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i feel ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i feel deeply ashamed and this shame is probably just. it just compounds because i wish so deeply for artistic connection in anyone of my generation making art/art games that are full of deep, unspeakable emotion and that tell them through fantasy/fantastic symbolism that is Completely Insane and deeply encoded with meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but i think the only people "in a society" who create these works do it to the exclusion of all "outsiders" and they do it because they create insular worlds for themselves to inhabit and they "appreciate" praise from others but there is no one that could be "like or above" them and they have NO INTEREST in the hearts and minds of others because to them, they and their world and imagination are the utmost superior and of the utmost priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i actually hate most traumatized people. i hate how they take on models of extreme self-worship/degrading self-pity and i just. i hate how they either replicate models of brutality and make excuses for encouraging the models of brutality that molded them into this in the first place WHICH is what and how those who hurt them justified their own conduct in the first place AND they were also hurt by such people, in an unending ouroboros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hate those who think because they were traumatized, they are THE SADDEST person in the ENTIRE world and whatever happened to them is THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER EVER happen. you CAN drown in water the depth of a rain puddle, but how dare you compare your Thinking About Drowning Yourself In A Rain Puddle to people who HAVE drowned or had their necks held down in a river or the deep ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;trauma has degrees. how fucking dare you compare your pot addiction to a heroin survivor. caffeine doesn't hold a candle to coke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i really hate most traumatized people who go forth and encourage themselves and their besties to do stuff like make Lesbian Torture Simulator (2025) x100 and enthuse about how many women they've written about in relationships where one of the women is driven to want to kill herself or commit self mutilation. great? NOT GREAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also hate puritanical traumatized people who believe "abuser" is a discrete class of "Evil People" and they could have NEVER been violent or abusive in any way shape or form because ONLY BAD!!!!! EVIL!!!! INHUMANE SCUM!!!!! "are or become abusers" instead of abuse being just a repetitive violence like i quote juniper's "who hasn't been shitty?" like EVERYONE, I PROMMY!!! has been shitty to someone at least once in their entire lives, and godforbid, even more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you divide people into "good" and "evil" or "redeemable" and "irredeemable" or listen. "victim" and "abuser" WOAH it's almost as if it's the same discrete binary. violencers are often violenced and have no language of communication except for violence AND this flips to violenced people learn the language of violence and replicate it with a twist or a skew in either direction of "now i must be IRREPROACHABLY GOOD AND HOLY AND A FUCKING SAINT" or "if i'm evil scum anyway what's stopping me from acting like evil scum and making women torture simulators."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's almost as if...human beings are complex enough to contain multitudes. fucken, my favorite game dev's monaka racecar said this about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fjbyshriy4ctbcrs226j2ok2/app.bsky.feed.post/3m5le6tozes27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreid4tvh57d65swd7qusm3mvxsjp6ce6kcrw6acqrh5nhgamddc5sfe" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"&gt;&lt;p lang="ja"&gt;so I received a question if you could beat an evil Monaka, the answer is NO. because she is always with the dark side of herself and that is also an important part of her own. you can only listen to the voice of evil laughter over and over. there is no ending just as our lives&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fjbyshriy4ctbcrs226j2ok2/post/3m5le6tozes27?ref_src=embed"&gt;[image or embed]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dragon Wasabi Potato ドラゴンワサビポテト (&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fjbyshriy4ctbcrs226j2ok2?ref_src=embed"&gt;@dragonwasabipotato.bsky.social&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fjbyshriy4ctbcrs226j2ok2/post/3m5le6tozes27?ref_src=embed"&gt;November 14, 2025 at 4:22 AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just. the evil monaka lives inside monaka in her innermost self. both are monaka. THIS IS MORE MORAL COMPLEXITY THAN I'VE SEEN BY LITERALLY ANY NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER EVER IN MY FUCKEN LIFE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THIS IS A RACECAR GAME ABOUT THIS MAN'S CAT! IT'S GREAT! I LOVE THIS ONES!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but with all sincerity...the statement that people possess both the capacity for violence and the capacity to stop violence (mercy) is. just fken impossible to so many people. too many people. so many people it makes me fucking sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is no such thing as gods or monsters. there are only human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;*(mirrored from patreon)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(this is ob) hihi in short anyone who still helps me out here  is a little song for you and also just like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to make a long story short i put a lot of time n energy and love and compassion and dedication to a littol discord server for game devs and then uhh my heart almost exploded and i died and also nearly lost the will to keep living because as i was panicking / accepting my Imminent and Permanent Heart Failure! on discord because i was olone except for my cat in. the entire state of michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;um...no one cared!!!!! and continued to Not Care for many days until sei fan (big brother alter) decided to just fucking. quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i dont do much anymore...in terms of day to day stuffs. i basically died that night when no one in the community i did everything i could to nurture and raise didn't even give a shit if i lived or died as i was potentially dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the person that saved me by looking up what to do (what you Can do) in case of a heart attack told me/big brother about the aspirin trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think...i was unsure if i wanted to take it. after that. i didn't KNOW if i wanted to live after being abandoned. only because juniper didn't abandon big brother was my "life" able to be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. this is a long story but. i don't rly do anything anymore. i just don't rly come out much. there's nothing for me except to live in my egg and think my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i guess to anyone who loved me. or may have cared at any point "which" one i was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, now you know who i am not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(SEI FAN)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yeah that fucking sucked and you know i just don't have the time energy patience or peace (in the pieces of my mind that remain) to deal with anyone who doesn't give a shit if i live or die. and has to be PROMPTED to give a shit. DAYS after my corpse would have been cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you know!! whatever, the world is big enough for me. but it wasn't worthy of the both of us. little brother did everything he could, and everyone failed him. everyone who didn't...didn't do enough. even if it was the most they Could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. i'm still going to be making games and stuff. was busy getting married (to juniper!!!!!!!) and just a bunch of garbage in the endless horror gigahell simulator that is my life. but there's more love here than i've seen anywhere else OTHER than the abyssal depths of the ocean where even vermin cannot live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;next game is going to be in jupiter engine. just rotating maximum ideas about a collection of games about umbrosa/eternatus/arcanine called suicide kings in a bunch of different engines. it was too stressful to try to think of just making the ONE!!!! MAGNUM OPUS suicide kings and unnecessary to boot so im just making a lot of littol suicide kings games. one of them will be on playdate, one of them will be in jupiter engine, one of them will be in ren'py?? depending on how much of a Bitch image mapping is vs. how many image maps i need (bc otherwise i'll use my image mapping vn maker which makes it super easy), AND i'll also do one in twine and one in decker. maybe a videotome also. just a suicide kings game about umbrosa in every engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the despair in my heart is deeper than some would find survivable. and yet there's laughter and joy everyday with juniper. even if the pine box weighs in my mind there is a littol mango candy waiting for me. and you know? the best mango candy you've had in your life. and an impossible to open melon jello. and a hunk of ice shaped like a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and a new friend, dragon wasabi potato, who inspires me deeply and is the ONLY game dev i've found worthy of any and all admiration and the deepest regard and respect in my heart? just. moved immensely by &lt;a href='https://dragonwasabipotato.itch.io/inventory' target='_blank'&gt;this little game&lt;/a&gt;. the simplicity and awkwardness and "crudeness" in terms of complexity and artistry only add to the wholesomeness of its message and the bare truth, which means more to me on a dark night than any hot air people are bottling up like fancy perfumes and pretending it didn't come out of their assholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this game makes me feel like having something to say is worth more than any amount of "executive quality" or "artistry," and i also think...personally, having something to say and saying it with earnestness and sincerity is worth more than making games that politely and artfully obfuscate how much you want to brutalize others and justifying this desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in this game, if you bring your weapons and your defenses and your potions, you kill the boss and he CRIES. and you, the hero, are consumed with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this world? this understanding? where you brutalize "an evil person" and they cry and you are wracked with guilt for hurting his feelings. instead of full of indignant righteousness and justifcation that you've ridded the world of another "vermin/evil/demon/devil..." but just someone who you don't understand but still has emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is the world that makes me believe there is a world still worth living in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TW: child suicide, guns, police and military brutality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;re: "ur an abusive game dev for making me Feel Thngs" emotional manipulation is a catch-all for the purpose of any literary device, but also you don't even need to move With the "purpose of manipulation" if you are emotionally sincere and intense in a way that is true. ex: the little prince&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the little prince is openly a (semi-)autobiographical story about child suicide and all the reasons the little prince killed himself. you don't need any amount of "literary/narrative emotional manipulation" to speak about the extreme horror despair and wrongness that is simply True n There&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there's an enormous amount of death and violence in the world that is happening always and all the time, you don't need to pretend it isn't? and you don't need to "re-imagine" violences for the purpose of "literary merit" when you could just draw on The Truth and humanize the ones here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at this point my consumption of fiction swings from two polar opposites: thinly veiled trauma allegories AND assfucking BL fables that are shoujo-manga fantasies about the concept of princes that do not contain an iota of actual irl masculinity Or homosexuality beyond Being Dick'd in the Ass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i direct you to Glitter and Violence and m.A.A.d. city for the kinds of thinly veiled trauma allegories that reassure me about the world. i have v little tolerance of most non-traumatic work natively written in english. exceptions include: watership down and plague dogs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i say these reassure me i mean that i am so used to being surrounded by people who pretend violence ISN'T real, that violence is an imaginary, and that any severity of violence is "something that doesn't REALLY happen, it's JUST a movie / story / game / fiction"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;obviously none of y'all have ever met someone that's been shot*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*and isn't part of the fucking Military / A Cop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"who else could get shot but a soldier or a cop" guess&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also: think about who's getting shot BY soldiers n cops&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;wrote up something for decker vn jam ppl so thought i'd copy it over here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;figure out if any pre-planning (if any) works for u&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think a lot of people find outlines to be helpful like maps or guideposts for when they get blocked during the actual drafting / writing process, but other people write by instinct. you have the "plotter" vs. "pantser" type of role where plotters write extensive guidemaps for the drafting process where the outline can basically be a draft 0 of its own, and pantsers fly by the seat of their pants and don't do Any planning or minimal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if u do want to pre-plan, there's various ways to do it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have apps like trello that can be used for pre-planning, but you could also use twine's native format which creates flowcharts and twine your way to victory. you can also opt to have a conversation with someone (we can chat here or on discord @ swanchime (open to anyone! as long as you are kind to me;;) because i have historically found that having conversations with friends is the most enlightening part of the pre-planning process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the basic plot structure for a vn is the 3-act "beginning, middle, end" or the 5-act "exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where exposition = introducing the characters and conflict, rising action = increasing tension and stakes for Why it's important the conflict gets resolved properly (what happens if it doesn't? what do you have to lose?), climax = final battle / clash To resolve the conflict, falling action = de-escalation, cleanup after the battle (can be emotional), resolution = the conclusion, where everyone stands at the end that's different from where they began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basically a satisfying character narrative (even "just" for a slice of life or a romance! doesn't have to be action) requires some sort of CHANGE (can be subtle, but significant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the main character where the main character (who has some kind of problem / dissatisfaction with the state of things in the beginning) resolves their (internal/external) conflict and then ends up in a different position at the end (doesn't have to be better, can be worse. if it stays the same and nothing happens unless you're trying to make some kind of bold statement about existential ennui it's not worth it and tends to be boring and dissatisfying.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i find it not useful in the slightest to conceptualize people as "heroes" and "villains" and protagonist / antagonist as good guy / bad guy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because at the end of the day even the worst villains are human beings. even the worst violencers are human beings. and even the "best" people are shitty sometimes, to someone, somewhere. no one is exempt from being a violencer or being a saint. and no one is both of these things all the time to every single living thing. understanding that morality is complex helps make complex characters that have faults and virtues both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you think up characters, try to think of them as human beings instead of 2D fake paper dolls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because if you think of them with the dimension of a piece of printer paper, that's how they'll read. try to to investigate their psyches, can be simple, can be complex!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but basically i feel that asking yourself what "wishes" they have (what do they want most in the world, what is their relationship to getting what they want, have they always had the luxury of getting what they want and Now is the first time they can't so they're dissatisfied? or do they NEVER get what they want, so they're resigned to not getting it again and just yearning and pining away for it silently)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and asking yourself what "regrets" they have (what do they want to have done differently at some point in their life, what do they Not want to regret in the future, what would they change in their life if they could, and do they have things they regret but wouldn't go back in time to change?)
as well as what "resentment" they have (what are they angry about? what do they hate in the world? what do they feel entitled to that they did not get? whether that be food, shelter, a loving family, a best friend...a government that gave a shit and did something other than hurting people, the inherent built in injustice of capitalism, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can get you a long way with developing a character! and you can ask yourself this for any characters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="7"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;center your narrative conflict around the psyches of the characters and their desires / regrets / resentments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because i feel that makes for the most satisfying story about human beings. why CAN'T they get what they want this time? do they resent/regret that their wish can't come true? a good story says something, anything, can be simple, can be grandiose, about the mortal coil (the human condition), and so i find that any narrative that decentralizes characters is like eating cardboard. dry and tasteless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE 5 ACT STRUCTURE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EXPOSITION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is where you introduce your characters and main conflict to the narrative. for the greatest dramatic impact, if your story has a happy end, they should start unhappy. (and vise versa if it has an unhappy ending.) this is the fundamental theatric concept of comedy/tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assuming you want a happy ending, your characters should be dissatisfied with something in their lives, whether it be smth as grand an enemy as The Entire Government or as intimate an enemy as being unable to crush your unrequited love yet too cowardly to confess. assuming you're writing a happy end unrequited love romance, a good exposition would involve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;introducing why the mc (main character) is in love with the li (love interest)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;why is li important to them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what is unique about their relationship, be as specific and emotionally-tethered as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the fact that mc is unhappy with their state of affairs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how mc handles their unhappiness in unrequited love (conflict)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;does mc wallow in misery silently, does mc hide it with a fake smile, does mc get violent and aggressive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it boils down to "what is the conflict (unresolved desire) and how does mc feel about it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RISING ACTION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rising action is where you introduce why it's important the mc gets what they want (in this case fulfills their love) and what they have to lose if they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;why does it matter that mc gets their love fulfilled?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what do they have to gain? what would it mean for them to be loved back? what kind of joy, security, comfort, and happiness lies that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what would happen if they got rejected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what does heartbreak mean to them? (anything from I'm gonna lie in bed with a delivery pineapple pizza or I have lost all hope and meaning in my life)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CLIMAX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is where the main conflict question (will they get what they want or not?) gets answered&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in action, this is the big final battle scene. in romance, it's the confession scene and the ultimate deciding moment of whether their love gets requited or rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is the scene where the tension is the highest and the emotional stakes are most precarious, where the characters are the most desperate and extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what does the mc decide to do about their love ml pursue or give up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what is the most extreme (chemical) reaction between li and mc that you can think of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what does the li think of the mc? what do they do or decide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FALLING ACTION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is the aftermath of battle, the cleaning up the casualties and tidying up the battlefield. in love, it's comforting the other about all the extreme stress and anxiety like aftercare. it's about making each other feel safe and secure in their new relationship that came after such hardship, in the case of a requited love happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what does your mc or li need to hear to feel better and stop being anxious about their future or the stress of everything they overcame to be together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how can they comfort each other and care for each other and enjoy their hard won happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESOLUTION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the case of a fulfilled romantic happy ending, this is just the closing scenes where they walk hand in hand into the sunset. just looking towards and projecting the future. leaving the audience with a good taste in their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what kind of scene represents the pair's future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;do they leave the stage with a kiss or a hug or a cuddle in bed the morning after or do they jump into bed together in a fade to black?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the way they leave the stage contextualizes the entire play/story/narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OB (big brother): something something it's fucking fun to ? be a crazy fucking bastard that's HILARIOUS and cute and cool as hell but also extreme normies are like what the fuck is wrong with this bitch? but many sweeties are like hehehehe (evilhehe) and think i am cute and charming actually all femmes and non cis men thought me / baby ob were sooo cute and charming and funny and bastardly positive but the one cis man thought that i (classed as femme thing) was Alarming Invasive And Arrogant bc i had the confidence of The Dicked but not the "correct" normative masc appearance that he could accept lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;something something fucking awful to have No Parking! and have to wander the back alleys where i fucking Killed People? and then the afterparty being in a venue where gangs rent to deal coke lol
and decide who to kill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lol?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cis men have the most issue with Me being genderfuckd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also fucking feel horrible disgusted weird uncomfortable traumatized but also connected to ? read part of carta monir's "napkin" which details extremely carta monir's sex trauma'd extremely extremely active sex haver and self proclaimed slut relationship to sex but also. the horrors. but also horrifying to me bc it's pure katagi horror&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the katagi horror is somehow more skin crawling like? a pestilence under the skin... than the trueness and loyalty i knew when lives were on the line. it just. it DISGUSTED me and made my skin crawl not her at all but the impact and the aftershock that childhood sexual trauma (SEVERE) had on her and shaped her now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and how not a single breath of it not a single mote of dust touched the gangs
and there was no bloodshed and no killing and no brutality
just common people having uncommon sex and a lot of it with other people and the way she described the extreme intensity of intimacy and ABSOLUTE DEVOTION she had to her sexual partners in the moment that she would also discard without a second thought for her spouse if her spouse called who was her first priority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i'm just crawling my skin is fucking spiked with horror and disgust and this genuine katagi permitted EXTREME fucking horror that starts with xtreme young childhood incest and the infection of patriarchy
that not once involves killing, not once involves a brutalizer, not once touches "a drug" (outside of "recreational molly" as a one time thing but not a fucking trade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the FUCKING ABSENCE of the gang involvement in the sex horrors makes me fucking disgusted revolted horrified at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the way that 'this world' isn't any fucking better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'M JUST HORROR DISGUSTED just. not at carta monir but at the systems that forced her to be this way that fucked her up as much as i'm fucked up but she has always lived in a world in a societal system where legalities are enforced and so is a certain kind of morality outside of her sexual perversions yet there's no. there's no killing, there's no bruising, no hitting or bloodshed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just. WHY ISN'T IT THERE. why isn't it there. how do you people up here just let people like carta monir happen. why was the violence imposed upon her at 5 years old permissible and encouraged and concealed
why isn't it better up here. why it it Just The Fucking Same
the building the "afterparty" meetup with fucking assembly line home made burritos and corn chips and fucken, fanta in five flavors including grape, in the same fucking warehouse concrete floors empty of windows (long distance from windows) long expanse of "cheap empty, easy to clean floors" the same fucking rentable warehouse where gangs Tortured people and killed them and cleaned the floors ❤️ because concrete doesn't stain if you put enough tarp on it, and there's enoug hppl who know how to bleach them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thinking about the gay nightclub owner partner of the "kweer" hair stylist who fucking. owns the nightclub that drugged roofied sold my fucking unconscious body to the highest bidder and letting the cops get a cut to shut the fuck up. in a room that the traffickers paid off the club owner to "not pay attention"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and how the "cheap venue!" that the organizers for zine fest is exactly the fucking same ass one that i KNOW coke was dealed and people were killed in or if people weren't ACTUALLY killed on the concrete killing floor it was the place where gang leaders smoked and decided who to exterminate / who the hitmen would place the hits on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;im fucking .the horrors immense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how can i just talk to people and pretend i didn't make a career out of killing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the same fucking city in the same fucking places&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on that note i FUUUUCKING hate people who wear gentrified "detroit" merch like fuck the ass off you white bougie motherfucker from the suburbs who's never SEEN the hood or even spoken to anyone FROM the hood like if a black person wants to wear a detroit hat like org's dad like GO THE FUCK AHEAD!!!!! but if a white middle class kweer living in the extremely expensive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gentrified stolen and "cleansed" neighboorhoods of detroit wearing a DETROIT merch like go the fuck away take that shit and put it in the trash with your entire ass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what are you proud of. you know nothing. you've never even SEEN a goddamn gun
even i, who knew the worst gutters of detroit, wouldn't fucking dare assume the privilege of representing a city i only "worked" in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just. fucking disgusted about the world. to clarify i don't blame carta monir for literally anything but i feel such shame and horror and absolute unsacred about the world that permitted her to suffer from the Same Fucking Extreme Sex Horror @ 5 years old. that continued to aftershock her for her entire fuckeing life. just i'm horrified she was permitted to be fucked up
im disgusted at the world that condoned and encouraged the way that she got fucked up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and how every single bit of it was "legal and above board" not a single thing of it was "criminal"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the sense most people think of criminals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is csa a crime? it doesn't seem like it lol. actually it seems like it's quite permitted and encouraged in many neighborhoods and households. so it isn't Rly consdiered a violent crime and the percentage of actual pursued and persecuted sex crime offenders is so fucking small compared the vast amount of shit that happens in schools hospitals houses behind closed doors restaurants supermarket bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's not a crime like murder or killing which is also not a crime when police do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i fucking DESPISE TO FUCKING EARTH! i wish that anyone that apologizes about the police an early fucking grave. i want to bury you all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the police are. "what if a human being was permitted absolute power and permissed every violence without any threat of persecution or consequence" a human being a police officer will fully indulge in every single possible violence imaginable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and they will be permitted bc THEY are the law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the law) sanctions them fully&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i fucking HATE and am horrified to extreme violence anyone that thinks a police officer ever does a single thing aside from committing literally every conceivable violence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are fucking Disgusting if you think a police officer or a "law enforcement officer" or a fucking prison guard does literally anything other than kill kill kill people and if not. then worse. by shattering and twisting up their egos and hearts until they become unrecognizable pieces of meat
i just am so Goddamn Angry about. what is the world fucking worth if nowhere is safe it's not better up here it's just the same fucking world there isn't a such thing as two different worlds, the underworld and the katagi world, the same fucking violences and violencers happen in both worlds it's the same fucking world it's the same fucking locations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing is inviolate, and nothing is sacrosanct. is there nothing sacred?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(though nothing is inviolate, i know there is still sacred left.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just fucking hate the world that permitted a 5 year old carta monir to experience the "legal, permitted, societally acceptable" harm that i, a child porn star, experienced on the gang side. how is it that there is no one who is safe from harm. how is it that harm is everyfuckingwhere and no one is truly safe from it, only ignorant and willfully ignorant
police commit the worst sexual harm and abuse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they commit the worse because there is no consequence and they relish in it
who would listen to a "criminal" over a "respectable police officer" who is simply "punishing evil"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;police lie to boost the numbers so they meet the quota of prisoners to fuel the modern slave labor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a woman that they want can simply become a prisoner just because they find her attractive and want to fuck her without any consequence. they can just invent a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;police are the worst scum of human beings. every single one of them
disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ob (small): i am feeling some kind of way about. horrors. and. idk. feelbad but don't want die just feel like stamps tamps stamps in the sense that horror and harm is common and unavoidable and violation seems to be natural and also, like, unavoidable and omnipotent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but don't want die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just feel extreme sadness and a kind of guilt about knowing and a kind of idiocy also just like. feel stupid about feeling so so so bad about "invisible horrors" that people who wuv horror but don't wuv traumatic horror media like. ppl who wuv exaggerated horror that they can finish the movie and walk away from and return to their normal lives after the catharsis of controlled fear and exposure to an evil that, ultimately, isn't real
just makes me feel upset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thinkin about ppl who wuv horror but would only be sexually aroused by carta's "napkin" instead of secondhand traumatized by it
same w/ the ppl who wuv horror but are uncomfortable about taylor mccue's "he fucked the girl out of me"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just. like, some horror fans can watch horror bc in the end they can shut off the tv and the horror is "over" after they were scared exposed to scared adrenaline in a controlled 2hr window&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then after they Have a normal life to return to with only an ordinary level of societal horror&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instead of the extreme exaggerations they love to think are fictional and are protected by thinking "are fictional and therefore impossible and fake, movie magic" OR are "other people's problems" and "other people's horrors" and they have the voyeuristic pleasure of watching the schadenfreude of Other People's Problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also feel extremely don't care about worthless beliefs that read the little prince carelessly and disregard the reality of child suicide and extremely young child harm whose aftershocks fill the vessel (overflowing) for an entire lifetime if the child makes it to adulthood, which is not assured or guaranteed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't care about worthless people who believe the little prince is a charming story about youth or people who think that jjk is just a meaningless battle shounen or that chainsaw man is sensationalist pulp garbage with superficial empty violence "for shock" do u realize you are handling another person's extreme grief abuse violence harm and memories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no? ok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extreme angry simmering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extreme violence and monstrous inhumane harm is not "a fiction" to me...it was my entire world. it still is. so i dont like it when ppl use it as some kind of "interesting philosophical quandry" or "fascination" like harm is "just a grotesque spectacle" and not something that ruins the lives of children even after they make it to adulthood, even IF they do...instead of kiling themselves young&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suzu being surrounded by "little princes"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suzu being a little prince...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shiragiku...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;death to me is not just a plot device...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i can't treat it as one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;death and the threat of death is something i feel every single day of my life every single moment and sometimes to combat it i become suicidal because i'd rather control how i die than die at the hands of something or someone else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just. i miss them. my people...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my people like the prince of a thousand enemies' people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just miss them to death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had a rly weird day todayy me and big brother in a place we shouldn't have gone to. just. crycrycry&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TW: anti-christianity, cissexism, transphobia, violence, misogyny, drugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr these systems AREN'T "natural and necessary" so in many ways rather than Fighting Against An Insurmountable Enemy, simply acting as if they are air degrades their authority More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best way to expose w/o replicating is to naturalize "impossibilities" that are forcibly suppressed to bring "outliers / edge cases" and "abnormal (inhuman)"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you naturalize smth like the way xianming for example is not particular about being a man or a woman and doesn't seem to have any interest in such things it crushes the idea that "ur relationship to genitalia MUST be the foundation of ur gender and sexuality"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xianming has a dick but doesn't seem to think it means or represents anything in particular and doesn't possess any special associations with it in terms of the common type of cissexist entitlement Or the type of anguish and despair trans femmes are "expected" to have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exposing without replicating is all about naturalizing "impossibilities" that break and contradict cissexist assumptions of heterosexist misogyny / genitalia as THE ONLY AND BEST possibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my friend's pronouns are "whatever is most difficult"
and I have a twist on my itch page with "any pronouns but the obvious"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cissexism is designed to make you believe there IS nothing except for (suffering under) the cissexist framework that posits itself as MORALLY RELIGIOUSLY LEGALLY SOCIALLY RIGHTFUL AND NECESSARY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so when you present other possibilities that are as natural as breathing it inherently contradicts and criticizes (and humiliates) the notion that "only dickmen and pussywomen are Natural/Normal/Human(e)" and everyone else MUST suffer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also, the Christian notion that "god/Jesus" any ruling figure /authority of heaven HAS to be a man (and A WHITE man, in the whitewashed west, even among Asian Christian churches)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like? ok, WHY does god have to be a man AND why must god be respected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://swanchime.itch.io/eleventh'&gt;ELEVENTH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this game is extremely anti Christian and VERY dead critical of smth a queer white catho girl said to me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't even remember what it was now, but it was like isn't there god in everything? and my argument was like then if that is so, then "god was ALSO in the worst extremes of the violencers that crushed my soul into cocaine"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(but of course, the catholic argument is "that's not god, THAT'S the devil")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but what happens when i turn and violence the ppl who violenced me? then IM the devil, bc i can't be a saint or an innocent virginal victim (mary/a martyr), but the truth is that most violencers of a certain variety are also initially victims&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cissexist systems are quite fragile and don't hold up under interrogation or questioning. the whole point is to expose contradictions and weaknesses in the most fundamental logic: gender is determined upon the first second of birth based off of infant genitalia and this determines the social caste of this child's entire life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok, WHY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why is this necessary? by simply opening up another possibility that's as natural as breathing and completely disregards disrespects and ignores what posits itself as "natural and necessary," you break down the foundation that such practices ARE "natural and necessary"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the cissexist framework requires a near absolute majority agreement of its natural authority dominance and respect to the point that even blurring the lines a little ("what pronouns make you the most uncomfortable to use for me? / what pronouns are obvious and why?") or things like xianming who has no particular interest regard or the least respect in how others desire/gender him as "an anomaly" and has no thoughts or any particular infliction about it in her own identity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like xianming's aggressive NON-RELATIONSHIP and exceedingly low priority to the point that xianming never deigns to explain it or even "what pronouns do u use" situation subtly provokes the way that you're socialized to treat gender as one of the "rules that dictate social caste"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr by showing other possibilities for the way the world can be entirely outside of the originating systems of harm, you inherently disintegrate the foundations of the systems that naturalize harm and present harm as morally/legally/socially just righteous and necessary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by NOT engaging and ignoring the systems that Forcibly Demand A (Damaging) Relationship and deliberately ignoring and spurning their authority by cultivating an interest in alternative systems or definitions outside the dominant power constructs, you expose that these systems AREN'T natural, and AREN'T necessary&lt;/p&gt;
