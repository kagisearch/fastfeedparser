    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been more than a month since the widespread demonstrations in Iran, which resulted in the mass murder of thousands of people. Life hasn't been the same since then. Every massive protest in Iran always unlocks the gate to a new era for social interactions, collective practices, and identity crises. This is the first time I've gone through the procedure not as an attending, active associate of the movement, but as an external observer, who is stretching to not be perceived as a passive, impotent member during a substantial period. Theretofore, the more I try to understand, the less I can make sense out of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in diaspora brings its own bias when you want to comprehend a conflict within the borders of the home country. I haven't visited Iran since March 2024, and consequently, my opinions aren’t firsthand, authentic, or calculated enough. They're an extreme blend of my own principles, observations from friends in Iran, and the content I consume from an already subjective media (thanks to algorithms). I recall chatting with my Russian friend, who had lived in the UK for almost a decade, about Sean Baker's "Anora". "When people live in a place, their presumption of that place will be the last impression they have from it", he said. I assume that's what I've been experiencing the most for the last 30 days. My thoughts aren't as clear as I want, and even when I discuss them in Farsi, I feel like I'm not actually speaking in my own language. I don't feel comfortable speaking Farsi anymore, as I'm not confident enough to talk about my opinion about the circumstances in Iran. After watching the monstrosity of the regime's actions in the last couple of weeks, from opening fire on defenseless civilians to butchering the children, those innocent beings, it's terrifying how we can experience a tragedy like this in real time and keep going like everything is the same, and not thousands lying dead on the floors of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot how to sleep at night. Usually, I go to bed around 12-1 am after checking the news. I wake up a couple of times, checking the news again. I picked up this habit during the 12-day war and haven't forgotten it since then. My body got more fragile, and mentally, it's challenging to maintain any sort of peace of mind. The pleasure is far-reaching, and the happiness isn't eternal. Even though I'm still living my "normal" life thousands of kilometers away from Iran, I feel a deeper grief inside me, something that I never felt before, something that I don't think I can find a cure for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never the most optimistic person in the room, but recent events made me even more paranoid. The fear of not hearing again from family or friends after waking up has been a constant feeling. After those two weeks of total blockage, I started talking to my friends again. I don't feel like I'm talking to the same people I used to know anymore. The despair, outrage, and trauma are significantly transparent and justified. During every conversation, I'm afraid of mentioning something that might annoy them or my opinion getting aggressively rejected by them. The society is at its most polarized, and there's almost no grey area to stand on. I can discern the anger in their tone. The ticking bomb echoes from their voice, and I can do nothing but absorb this bitterness. An anger that is more justified than ever. An anger that grows from the grief that we all feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what will come next, and I don't think I have any power to change it. Unfortunately, the future for my country, and for my people, is in the hands of those who care about it less than anyone. Who knows what will happen in the span of the next 30 days when I'm tapping on my keyboard again. By then, I'll try to reflect the struggle, the tragedy, as best I can due to my responsibility as an Iranian. A forever Iranian.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gambling on its own is arguably the worst thing ever happened to our society, and now you can literally bet on anything, not just football games; from warfare around the globe to the odds of curing cancer before a specific date. You have people from the governments gambling on the prospect of a new crisis in the Middle East and earning generational wealth solely because they have access to secret information that we don't. The same individuals use that money to visit a particular island, but that's a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main point is that Polymarket’s rapid rise represents more than just a new platform; it’s a legal, documented version of high-stakes games like those portrayed in “Squid Game”. This is especially striking, given recent cultural conversations about anti-imperialism and inequality, as seen in both “Squid Game” and “Parasite”. It appears that public desensitization to tragedy is now so decisive that monetizing trauma has become disturbingly easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During recent protests in Iran, as was the case earlier in Venezuela, people began betting on highly sensitive events, like whether Trump would attack Iran or if Khamenei’s regime would fall. Journalists started using data from these gambling sites to shape their analysis. What startled me was the level of influence such platforms now possess. It’s not surprising to imagine that insiders, armed with exclusive information, could bet on life-and-death outcomes for profit, and nobody cares about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animosity of Polymarket is shadowing the world in a way that no other new technology is doing so. When the attention of your audience is shifting from actual news agencies towards a gambling website, it indicates the status of dehumanization that we are dealing with in the big 2026, thanks to our great leaders around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Notes About 2026 Protests in Iran 2.0</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1- In the Ocean of Misinformation and Fastfoodization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been two weeks since my first notes on the recent events in Iran. The government has maintained the internet shutdown, although some selected websites and platforms are now accessible (white-listed), mainly for regime supporters to spread their agenda. Meanwhile, several VPNs are functional again, with rumors suggesting that wider internet access might return soon. Internationally, Donald Trump's statements about being "locked and loaded" did not lead to support for protesters, but instead seemed to signal military escalation or intervention in the Middle East. While threatening other countries with tariffs and focusing on anti-China rhetoric, Trump paradoxically invited leaders like Mr. Warcriminal Putin to his so-called "board of peace." Considering he already invited two of the most infamous individuals on the planet, I wonder what the objectives are for this group of corrupted fellas. What an amazing time to be a politician-comedian. (Interestingly enough, one of the few sane politicians left at the moment used to be an actual comedian and still has a better understanding of politics)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- The Issues with Pro-Israeli Diaspora&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Iranian diaspora, I think I need to address some issues that I witnessed over the last couple of weeks. First of all, I don't defend the point of bringing the Israeli flag to demonstrations. I do understand Israel is one of the few countries that "on paper" supports the protests, yet I don't think it's a good idea to involve a group of genocidal maniacs. At the same time, some Iranians were nagging about why the Muslim community or the Arab countries were ignoring the protesters or repeating the regime's narrative of them being Mossad agents. Recalling the last couple of years, many Iranians were glazing Netanyahu's atrocious crimes in Gaza while partaking in Pro-Israel rallies in the West, trying to represent the Iranian diaspora as a secular community, which is absurd considering they/we literally escaped a radical religious regime only to take the same side as another radical religious regime. I'm not a huge fan of Israel's contribution to this, and taking their flag was disgusting (like everything else about them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3- You ain't Left, You are Just Performative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online activism is useful from time to time, and there are several proper instances, as we have seen the success of MeToo, BLM, and even Pro-Palestine movements in the last 10 years. However, there's always a chance of miscalculation with this type of activism, just like anything else. Unfortunately, many of the global north activists ended up recounting the same propaganda that the Iranian regime is trying to push since the public protests broke out. As I mentioned, the most famous ones are "Protesters are Mossad agents" and "USA paid them to riot," and adding it to the astonishing record of the USA interventions in the global south and Israel's campaign of horror, these are easy narratives to sell in the fast-paced world of social media. As I wrote in my post about how many leftists misinterpreted the motives of the protests, the lack of familiarity with the Iranian demographic resulted in the conception of "Iran being a muslim country," which is conceivably the biggest lie that the Islamic Republic has been trying to establish for the last half a century. Two things can be true at the same time: A) Israel is doing a genocide in Gaza, and B) Khamenei, who has fought with Israel via proxies and during the 12-day war, is doing a massacre in Iran. If you support one of these notions and oppose the other, you are just a performative hypocrite who doesn't really care about the losses but the ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4- Why I Don't Support a New War&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History has shown us that there is no good in war, and if something is worse than a war, it is an American war. From nuking Japan to fully destroying Libya, Afghanistan, and Yemen, I don't truly remember any war in which the US intervention had a positive outcome. Some might mention the USA's presence in WW2, but let's be honest and forget Trump’s gaslighting; the Soviets were the reason for Hitler's defeat, and I say that as someone who doesn't even like Stalin or any other Soviet leader to begin with. American propaganda did an incredible job of retelling that story and portraying themselves as the savior. Also, I don't live in Iran. For sure, my parents, friends, and relatives are still there, and I might not judge anyone inside the country who advocates for the US intervention, but as a person living his life without any threat of war, I can't do that. It's been almost 6 months since the 12-day war, and I do remember how Israel, which could easily kill any IRGC commander, was also killing innocent citizens with missiles and drones, so yeah, I can't support that as I didn't back then. My morals were always against any war, and I don't see any logic to change that, considering going through it by myself and witnessing my friends in Ukraine, Iraq, and Afghanistan still suffering from the pains and wounds of the war at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5- Zahhak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to talk with some of my friends in Iran. Some said there's a smell of "blood" in the streets. Some said everyone knows at least one person who has either been killed by the regime or arrested during the protests. Discussions about "who is responsible?" are all over Twitter, and while I definitely blame both Trump and Reza Pahalavi for lying to the protesters about the "help on the way," knowing the animality of the regime, nobody is as responsible as Khamenei for this horrendous massacre. In Iran, we have an ancient tale about a tyrant called "Zahhak" who used to kill two people every day to feed the snakes he had on his shoulders. The reports are talking about numbers as large as 12,000 to 30,000 deaths at the moment, and I don't know how many snakes Khamenei has on his shoulders at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I watched "Hit the Road" two years before fleeing Iran and with my parents. I remember around that time, I finally made my decision to leave everything and everyone behind, going after a new life far away from home, searching for freedom, happiness, and my own inner peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the departure, I hugged my parents and my brother. My brother was furious that I was not crying. I didn't know. I couldn't digest the significance of what I'm doing at that moment. It's been two years since I last saw my parents, my brother, and my friends from Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I rewatched "Hit the Road" at Noa's house and on his projector. I was accompanied by people who now I see as a part of my family. When I saw them laughing at the jokes, I was so satisfied since I could witness them getting the humor in Farsi. When they gave compliments about the landscapes, I missed Iran even more. I got by heart how much I miss my parents and how much I miss my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I reach my goals after all? Maybe. I'm happy that I found a community that offers me hope, joy, and stability. I'm also freer than my last couple of years in Iran. But did I find that "inner peace" I was looking for? I don't think so. I found out my peace is not only associated with my own condition, but also the people I care for. Those who are going through the viciousness of the Islamic regime in Iran. My loved ones have been disconnected from the world outside for the last two weeks as a result of the internet blockage. I don't have any inner peace as long as the lives of my loved ones are in danger and they have to resist for their happiness, freedom, and inner peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hit the Road" made me miss home so much, it also made me realize how blessed I am to be around these amazing people, and made me proud of being an Iranian and nothing can change that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Failure of Mainstream Left</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I should begin this post by emphasizing that, as an Iranian, I don't expect foreigners to respond to what is occurring in Iran. I acknowledge that at this time, we are all going through our own problems, and if someone oversees the circumstances around the globe, it’s indeed admirable and an absolutely compassionate act. With that being said, I appreciate silence more than slamming a movement such as the recent protests in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the protests in late December, many "activists" have been calling it out as another Mossad-CIA operation in Iran. These activists, who are predominantly "pro-Palestinian," not only lack any sort of knowledge regarding the political climate in Iran, but also prefer to comment in a way that is the opposite of the “cause” they stand for. There are several parallels between these protesters and the Gazans. They are both fighting for the bare minimum for their lives. They want freedom not only speech, but "living" equally and having privileges that have been stolen from them for decades. While there are disparities on paper between the Islamic regime and Zionists, in practice, they took the identical approach; they both massacre powerless people with no shame while calling them "terrorists". Every time a reporter questions Netanyahu why you bombed that hospital or killed that journalist, he hides behind "Hamas," and you just need to go through the recent interviews by the regime's officials and notice how many times they used the word "terrorist" to not only devalue the protesters, but also legitimize their crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures such as Hasan Piker, Mehdi Hassan, Cenk Uygur, and others who "rightfully" got a lot of credit due to speaking against Zionists and the Trump administration are now reproducing the regime's agenda and putting the blame not on the IRGC or the supreme leader, but Mossad, and calling it another operation like the 1953 coup d'etat. My issue with this narrative, apart from living in Iran for 23 years and undergoing multiple crackdowns, is that Mossadegh was truly an eminent figure who was harming Western influence in the Middle East. He was a dedicated nationalist who not only cared about his administration but also the sovereignty of Iran. Do I see the regime that is butchering the youths in the streets (another similarity to Israel), the same as Mossadegh? Undoubtedly not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was discussing this topic with a friend lately, and I need to add that I believe the main explanation behind this failure by the "leftist" influencers is that they are not as "left" as they might presume. I'm sure none of them has read one page of The Capital or educated him/herself more than some random data from the Internet. Their actual school of thought is "anti-Americanism" and not even "anti-Imperialism". Anti-Imperialism will push you to support not only Palestinians, but also Ukrainians and Iranians who are fighting against external and internal forces to maintain their freedom. Two things can be true at the same time, and if you think being a leftist means you should always check if your goal is against the USA, sorry, but that's just kindergarten-level policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;1- It is important to understand the context of the current protests in Iran. Isolating this movement from its predecessors is a misstep in fully comprehending the Iranian community as a whole. Each movement in Iran is a continuation of the earlier efforts. After the 2009 presidential election, with a high turnout of 88%, many came to the streets to fight the results, chanting "Where is my vote?" they primarily were not looking for a "regime change", but a "reform" of a radicalized Islamic Republic that was on a downward spiral at that point due to the terrible economic and social decisions made by both Ayatollah Khamenei (the Supreme Leader) and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (the president). Regardless, the regime responded with absolute cruelty, putting the leaders of the movement under house arrest, charging and killing dozens of activists and individuals who just wanted to show their disagreement with the regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- Since then, there were a few movements here and there, mostly criticizing both social and economic issues within the country, but nothing was as bloody as the 2019–2020 protests, widely known as "Bloody Aban". After a significant increase in oil prices and escalation of tension between the regime and protesters in the last couple of movements, protests began on the 15th of November 2019. Yet, this was the largest movement since the 2009 election, and even in the more religious cities of Iran, such as Qom and Mashhad, crowds gathered to demonstrate their disapproval of the regime and the incompetence of the supreme leader. Unfortunately, this movement resulted in yet another brutal answer by the regime, resulting in an absolute massacre of defenseless people. There are numerous reports highlighting the number of casualties, from 300 to 1500. The fluctuation in the numbers shows the level of ambiguity of the regime and its death toll, and the failure of the international media to provide an accurate report on the event.nt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3- Mahsa Amini was killed by the Hijab police on the 16th of September 2022. This time, the movement had a much more "social" driven force that made it quite distinct from prior occasions. Still, it was another instance of the complexity of the movements in Iran. "Women, Life, Freedom" (Jin, Jiyan, Azadî / Zan, Zendegī, Āzādī) was the outcome of another social, political, and economic failure of a regime that is under international sanctions and yet has no interest in providing the least for its people, not only that, but put more pressure to violate any sort of stability. Even though this movement was also challenged by aggression from the regime, it was showing how Iranians still believe in the importance of the streets and opposing a regime that has restricted them for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4- The shift from "reforming" to "replacing" the Islamic Republic emerged in less than two decades of economic, political, social, and even climate collapse. Iran's Rial is nearly worthless, the regime's "axis of resistance" is more vulnerable than ever, society is alienating itself from any Shia practice, and water and electricity deficiencies have been a major issue for almost every city in the country. These are the main causes that people are rallying in the streets and seeking any opportunity to damage Khamenei's regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5- The silence from left-wing activists is tragic, but understandable. The Islamic Republic regime secured a lot of international respect due to opposing Israel and Trump during both 12-Days War and the 7th of October. However, it is unfair to overlook what Khamenei and his regime are doing to their own people just because they positioned themselves against imperialism and their inhumane and genocidal actions in Palestine. For sure, Netanyahu and his orange pedophile are war criminals with the blood of many on their hands, but Khamenei is not that different. I see many journalists and public figures on the left pushing to connect the protesters to Israel and the USA. While this interpretation can be somewhat justified, considering Zionists' pushing for Reza Pahlavi (son of the last Shah of Iran) to become the next leader and Trump's recent tweets, this movement, just like the “Green Movement”, “Bloody Aban”, and “Women, Life, Freedom”, is the consequence of decades of terror and suffering dictated to the people by the regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6- A video is circulating of a burning mosque in Iran. Some muslim journalists have been calling this an Islamophobic act and condemning Iranians for that. This is another example of the lack of understanding about the country and the people. While a "mosque" is known to be a sacred religious place for muslims around the globe, it is also a mark of atrocity for the people who went through the authoritarianism of radical Islamists for almost half a decade. Many of these mosques are the bases for the IRGC and Basij forces, who are actively shooting people in the streets. That is why the context of this protest is important, and many so-called journalists are not bothering themselves to search about their subject before engage farming on their social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7- In the end, I want to mention that Iranians inside the borders will ultimately make the decision for their future. No foreign government can dictate their destiny, and long live freedom for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was 9 years old the very first time I went to a protest. It was during the 2009-10 election when the corruption occurred. During that time, if I'm not wrong, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube all got shut down by the regime. At that age, I didn't have a phone, and clearly, I didn't know what it felt like to lose my access to a certain "social media". 8 years later, another massive protest started in Iran. The government put more regulations on the Internet, and after the blackout, some news outlets reported 1500 were killed by the regime. Almost 2-3 years later, the tragedy of the Ukraine Plane happened, when the regime shot missiles at an airplane by mistake and killed hundreds of university students and other Iranians who were on their route to Kyiv. More protests. My last experience in Iran was during the “Women, Life, Freedom” movement in 2022. Perhaps that was the first time in my life I felt the fear of death while being in the streets. It was the first time I heard the gunshot, and it was the first time I saw people getting killed by the police. My hometown, Mashhad, is a religious city, and as a result, there are more conservatives and people close to the government than anywhere else. I had never seen any protest as huge as the one in 2022 in my life with my own eyes. It was both glorious and scary to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regime shut down the internet for a couple of days during that time. Even the best VPNs stopped working. The world was in absolute darkness for us. As someone who was raised with a delicate connection to others, anywhere and anytime, I was terrified of what was happening to my friends. I had no option but to wait for the sun to rise, only to check if everyone is alive and not arrested by the police. To many of us, getting arrested wasn't that different from death. I came to China 2 years later. There were multiple small protests here and there since then, and the internet got shut down for a while during the 12-day war with Israel, but even then, I didn't feel the same level of fear that I'm experiencing now. During the war, there was more extensive international exposure, which could get information from the country, and the internet wasn't as weak as now. Currently, I have zero idea what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have the VPN account that I bought in Iran, and whenever the internet shuts down there, I'll also lose access to it. Last night, the VPN couldn't connect. I just left the cinema with my friends and checked the other free VPN I have and realized none of my friends in Iran has texted me in 3 hours. None of the Telegram channels had a new post, and Instagram was no different. I panicked. I tried my best to keep my shit together, but when I got home, I went into full meltdown mode. Now it's been almost 20 hours since I have no idea where my friends are and what they are doing. I can't focus on anything but that, and the more time that passes, the more I feel fragile. I feel deeply shattered by this pain, and I don't think there will be anything that can heal it apart from seeing them being happy. I was talking to my parents yesterday, right before going to the cinema, and while deep down I have some comfort that they are safe, I know how inconsistent and chaotic everything is in the Middle East. Hopefully, the sun will rise again, and this time, there won't be any grief.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working on my thesis has already exposed me to many cinematic concepts that I didn't know had a name. One of the more interesting cases is "beamering". As Biltereyst and Aboulaoula (2021) wrote in their amazing paper called "Corona Cinephilia", beamering is "the act of watching films at home by projecting the image onto a wall with a digital projector. The beamer is used to recreate the immersive cinema experience at home" and for the last couple of weeks, thanks to Noa, we were enjoying this phenomenon. I used to watch movies with others in places other than the cinema before as well. Back in Iran, I used to start a movie on my laptop at the same time as my friend from another town, or invite others to my apartment to watch something on TV. The disparity, however, is the quality of the experience. The duo of wall and projector obviously won't have the same screen quality as a TV or a laptop; however, beamering has a much closer feel to cinema. First of all, the way that the projector and wall function is comparable to the movie projector and the screen in the cinema. Besides, I believe people tend to pause the film during the beamering less than on TV or a laptop. This is much closer to the cinema experience, where the audience has no control over the screening. Also, the community factor is another important objective. Again, based on recent experience, I feel this kind of watching is a much more intimate approach, and even the pre-screen and post-screen have the identical feeling to the cinema. Beamering works like a special ritual, but the TV/laptop case feels less unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I watched many masterpieces on my laptop, but the experience of watching “The VelociPastor” was more "meaningful" not only because watching a B-movie is generally a fun experience, but the fact that I watched it on another night of beamering at Noa's with a group of friends made it special. Overall, I think beamering is one of those rare humane pleasures that Capitalism hasn't ruined yet, and hopefully will continue as long as cinema is alive (and not fully bought by Netflix).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Few Words For Home</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of days, I was struggling to put together my thoughts and write about how I feel about the new wave of protests that are occurring in Iran, my country. I don't think at this certain time, anything can speak louder than the actions of the people who are going to the streets, in front of the guns and bullets of the police. As an Iranian living abroad, the best I can do is to demonstrate the viciousness of the regime and inform others about the pain we have all been going through since we were born. The pain and sanctions were dictated to us by our own government and foreign states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since childhood, I recall the dialogue regarding us, the new generation, fleeing the country as a consistent part of family gatherings. Subsequently, during high school and college, it became a common goal for most of us. Evidently, not everyone in the country with a collapsing economy has the privilege to escape. Many of us had no option but to stay due to several factors, and those who left also had to adapt themselves to the new circumstances, facing many struggles as a result of having an Iranian passport. Our identity limited us not only inside the borders, but also way further from our home. We grew up hearing “going abroad will save you from this jail”, but the jail was never within those borders, but encrypted to our identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not believe this sense of imprisonment was created solely by the Islamic Republic. External influences from both the West and East have contributed as well. We grew up with threats of invasion and exploitation. Even the so-called opposition groups often proved ineffective, offering little except false hope. While some people in diaspora support Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah, and suggest the monarchy's return as a solution, I respectfully disagree. In my view, restoring monarchy in 2026 is deeply problematic, reflecting an idealized view of the Pahlavi era rather than a realistic path toward democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it is unhelpful when some outside observers praise Ayatollah Khamenei for his stance against American influence, the sentiment that skyrocketed even more in the online sphere after the recent capture of Maduro by the USA. Leaders such as Khamenei and Kim Jong Un should not be compared uncritically to other global figures, especially by those with a limited understanding of Iran. While opposing external threats is important, it cannot be the sole reason to support a leader. To me as an Iranian, there is no difference between a dictator like Khamenei with Trump and Netanyahu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening in Iran is nothing but the outburst of decades of oppression by the regime, repression by the international governments and organizations, and the brutality of everyday life under the claws of radical ideologies. There is nothing but joy and calmness I can wish for my brothers and sisters in Iran, as I cannot imagine the pain they are experiencing in times like these. In the end, we are proud to be Iranian, and nothing can change that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night I watched "The VelociPastor" with a group of friends in Noa's apartment. On paper, the story of a priest who can turn into a dinosaur and teams up with a hooker to punish bad guys isn't the most elite cinephile-friendly narrative ever, but what can I say? I loved it. It's been a long time since the last "B-Movie" that I watched, and due to certain reasons, they always have a safe spot in my heart. Generally, I don't understand the hate towards them from the upper echelon of the cinephile society, usually those who have a preference for specific European cinemas. The beauty of something like "The VelociPastor" is that a group of people pooled their resources to create a movie this ridiculous, knowing that nobody in Hollywood would take them seriously. This is why I have more respect for the cast and crew of a movie like this than for certain films that have been made solely to gain recognition from an event like Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pleasing aspect of watching “The VelociPastor” was that after having two courses related to movie production, I could quite comprehend the effort they put into the project and some visual techniques that they used during the movie. It felt like since having these courses, I frankly learned something related to my interests, and who knows, maybe connected to my future career path.&lt;/p&gt;
