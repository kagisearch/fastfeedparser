										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Put the coffee on, maybe pour a glass of wine. This will take you about eight&nbsp;minutes to read, but it might be a great way to recalibrate for the year ahead</em><strong>.&nbsp;</strong><em>If you&#8217;re looking for the winners of the Gura Gear Giveaway, you can find those towards the bottom of this piece.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>My first camera was relatively easy to use. A fully manual Pentax Spotmatic, the functions were few: shutter, aperture, and focus. I never revelled in the simplicity, but only because I had nothing against which to compare it, so I knew no better. Simple as it was, there was no shortage of challenge in making the kind of photographs I wanted to make. There was a world of composition and storytelling to learn—a world of light I didn&#8217;t yet know that I didn&#8217;t know. After 40 years, I&#8217;m <em>still</em> learning about light and colour and all the other things that make a photograph I love.</p>



<p>Hell, even my first digital camera was relatively simple compared to the marvels that sit nestled in the camera bag at my feet as I await a flight to Kenya tonight. Each of them is just one upgrade cycle away from being incomprehensible to me. At the same time that I got my first digital camera, I also decided to learn Photoshop, bought a book, powered through the lessons, and gained something like proficiency. But now? That young man was pretty fluent in Photoshop after a year, but he wouldn&#8217;t even know where to begin with the current version; he wouldn&#8217;t even recognize the interface.</p>



<p>Ah, the good old days, right? Well, no. I don&#8217;t miss being limited to ISO 64 of Kodachrome or knowing that my Ilford Delta 3200 would give me grain the size of GrapeNuts. I don&#8217;t miss manual focus or even the so-called autofocus of my 2016 Fujifilm X-T2. Compared to that camera, the autofocus of my Sony A1 feels like honest-to-Dumbledore magic. And what I can do now in post-production, I couldn&#8217;t have imagined 20 years ago.</p>



<p>The good old days had simplicity on their side, but probably only in hindsight. Give it twenty years, and kids will look back at the most advanced of our cameras and wonder if they&#8217;re wood-burning. They will look at the gear we now find so miraculous in the same way 20-somethings now look at rotary phones, cassette tapes, and people who still have Hotmail accounts.</p>



<p>How we make photographs continues to evolve. As it does, the options multiply, the vocabulary we use to describe those options requires greater expertise to understand, and it gets easier to get overwhelmed—or ashamed at how truly understand fewer and fewer of the options. For some, this is an exciting challenge; for others, it feels like just another barrier getting in the way of doing the thing you love.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If it weren&#8217;t for the restraining orders, I&#8217;d be on the phone with the engineers screaming, &#8220;Enough!&nbsp;Stop touching things! It&#8217;s good the way it is!&#8221;</strong></h4>



<p><br>For all the advances, the camera in your hands still does something remarkably simple: it records a focused beam of light, freezing in time a moment, a gesture, a lick of colour, or a &#8220;Hey, look at that&#8221; that otherwise would go unlooked at. It helps slow the relentless hands of time a little, gives us handles for memories that, by their nature, can be a little slippery and hard to hold onto.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This craft can be as complicated as you want it to be, but it can be enough that you know enough, you know? You don&#8217;t need to know it all.</strong></h4>



<p><br>You don&#8217;t need to know <em>everything</em> your camera can do before you delight in a simple line&nbsp;or use it to explore a landscape in which you find wonder. You need not touch every button or even know what they do, to stop your lens down, slow your shutter, and focus your lens on something that takes your breath away. The basics still do what the basics have always done. They were good enough for Ernst Haas and Cartier-Bresson and Erwitt and Lange and whoever it was who made the picture that ignited that spark in you that still burns today when you pick up a camera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are hundreds of options in most contemporary cameras. You are obligated to know or use no more of them than what serves you in your particular pursuit, and there is no shame in admitting that, no, you really don&#8217;t have any idea what that one does.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After 40 years, am I self-conscious that I now look at menu items without so much as a glimmer of recognition? A little. What does this one do? Hell, I don&#8217;t even know what the words mean. Was that option even <em>there</em> yesterday?</strong></h4>



<p><br>You&#8217;re not alone if you feel like there are more functions on your camera that you don&#8217;t understand than those you do. That&#8217;s OK. You can well afford not to know everything about how your camera works. Or what those new features in Lightroom do. If you don&#8217;t need it, you don&#8217;t need it. And if you do, you&#8217;ll figure it out. But none of us can afford not to know how photographs work. Nor can we afford not to understand our creative process and who we are as artists. That&#8217;s where we should be spending our limited attention.</p>



<p>I have seen achingly beautiful work from photographers who barely know how to use more than the basics with their cameras. They know what they need to know, and that&#8217;s enough. Do they know what 90% of their menu items do? They do not. Not a sniff of an idea about most of it. When it comes to the deeper mysteries of their cameras, they are, forgive my saying so, just about as dumb as a box of hair. But they know enough. Shutter. Aperture. Focus. And they know how to work a line with indelible grace; they know how to finesse a complicated composition and tell a story not easily forgotten. They explore their scenes with courage and curiosity, and play with colour with such nuance it takes the breath away. I wish I knew my craft as well as they do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also photographers who can talk excitedly—and with great expertise—about their cameras all day long. They know every new function in Lightroom before it&#8217;s even released. But they don&#8217;t have a word to say about what makes a picture do what it does to touch the heart or the imagination.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Their pictures are sharp, but they are not <em>poignant</em>. They have near limitless depth of field, but no depth of <em>feeling</em>.</strong></h4>



<p><br>It&#8217;s not a question of which is better; it&#8217;s a question of what you <em>want</em>. What you strive for with your work. Most of us can&#8217;t do both with the time and attention we have. We can know only a few things truly well and deeply, with the kind of comfort we might call mastery. It&#8217;s possible to know everything there is to know about a guitar and know nothing about making music. Of the millions of people who know how to use Microsoft Word with near prodigious expertise, how many of them know how to write a great story? And if it&#8217;s a shit story, and it fails to resonate, will you marvel instead at the formatting?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You could be Stephen King or Mary Oliver and barely know where to find the vowels on a keyboard. With the technology, it would be enough to know enough. The magic was never in the tools, anyway.</strong></h4>



<p><br>Knowing your craft is a much deeper, bigger, and more hallowed thing than merely knowing your camera—or the software, and many of you are much closer to the former than you think. It is so much better to be really good at working a scene and digging deeper into your creativity than to be really good at working a camera and digging deeper into the menus. And if you&#8217;re still young (in this craft, if not in years), then learning to do the former will be much more rewarding than obsessing about the latter.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If I had to choose,&nbsp;I&#8217;d rather know everything I could about how photographs work than how to work everything on a camera.</strong></h4>



<p><br>What a very long way of saying this: you probably know enough, and that&#8217;s enough. The best part, the hard part, still remains. Pick up the camera and go make something you love. That, too, is enough.</p>



<p>For the Love of the Photograph,<br>David</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>In French, my&nbsp;last name, <em>duChemin</em>, means &#8220;of the road.&#8221; I was born to travel.

<p><br>For the last 15 years,&nbsp;<a href="https://guragear.com/?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gura Gear </a>has been with me on every trip. I use their Kiboko 30L camera bags, the Chobe&nbsp;computer satchel,&nbsp;and now their Mara duffel bags. In every one of those bags, you&#8217;ll find their various EtCetera accessory pouches keeping me organized. I love the design, rely on the quality, and am so proud and grateful to have Gura Gear support my work. And, though you shouldn&#8217;t need it, its customer support is second to none.</p>



<p>So late last year, they reached out and asked,&nbsp;&#8220;Can we send you anything?&#8221;&nbsp;I looked around my office at all the piles of gear and the bags those piles would&nbsp;go in and, probably for the first time ever, thought, &#8220;Wow—there&#8217;s nothing I need.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even recognize myself as I said it.</p>



<p>But then I thought of you and asked if they&#8217;d be willing to share that same love with&nbsp;you. It wasn&#8217;t just an immediate yes;&nbsp;they said, &#8220;Send us a list.&#8221; So I did, and not only did they give me everything on that&nbsp;list, they added to it. And together, we&#8217;re giving it all away.<br></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>Gura Gear is giving us three&nbsp;great prizes, and all you have to do is leave a comment here on my blog (below) by February 07&nbsp;to enter. We&#8217;ll then do a random draw on February 08 and select three&nbsp;names for the following&nbsp;prizes:</strong></h4>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>First prize is a Kiboko 30L+ Camera Backpack (black)</strong>. WINNER: Alison Bowditch</h4>



<p><a href="https://guragear.com/collections/camera-backpacks/products/kiboko-30l-camera-backpack-with-laptop-sleeve?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the same bag I&#8217;ve travelled the world with for the last 15+ years</a>, though it&#8217;s been updated with a laptop sleeve. This bag is one of the lightest on the market, fits into every plane I&#8217;ve ever been on except the smallest regional jets, but that&#8217;s not fair because <em>nothing</em>&nbsp;much bigger than a laptop fits into those overhead bins, though even then it will fit under the seat. It&#8217;s also one of the few bags that will take a 600/4.0 lens. The design is exceptional, and the build quality is brilliant. I&#8217;ve carried this bag comfortably through too many airports to count, and it has never let me down.<br><br>How much do I love this bag? I have eight&nbsp;of them in all different sizes and&nbsp;colours. Don&#8217;t judge me; I like my camera bags, and I&#8217;m a weak man.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Me and my Mara 60L Duffel. Dressing to match is entirely optional.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Second prize is a 60L Mara Duffel Bag (Sahara)</strong>. WINNER: Aaron Carpenter</h4>



<p><a href="https://guragear.com/products/mara-travel-duffel?ref=tezywyhs&amp;variant=45614976467197" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the same bag I&#8217;ve&nbsp;packed for next month&#8217;s month-long&nbsp;trip to Kenya.</a> Made from the same X-pac fabric used for their camera bags, it&#8217;s the lightest and most durable fabric available. I can put a lot of stuff into this bag, and the internal pockets help keep it organized. With great grab handles&nbsp;and comfortable backpack straps (if you want them), this duffle is my new favourite.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Third prize is an accessories package.</strong> WINNER: Troy Patterson</h4>



<p>Three EtCetera pouches (one <a href="https://guragear.com/collections/camera-supports/products/et-cetera-pouch-medium-1?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medium</a>, one <a href="https://guragear.com/collections/camera-supports/products/et-cetera-case-s-1?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small</a>, one <a href="https://guragear.com/collections/camera-supports/products/et-cetera-case-xs-1?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">x-small</a>), a <a href="https://guragear.com/collections/camera-supports/products/tembo-12-memory-card-wallet?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tembo card wallet</a>, and one of their brand new tech organizers (so new I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s even on the website yet). If you keep saying you&#8217;re finally going to get all those little bits and pieces organized, this will help. My bags and Pelican cases are full of the EtCetera pouches—they&#8217;re the only way I can keep track of all the smaller bits of gear, the batteries, the chargers and cables, etc.  This package is worth about USD$150.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>That&#8217;s almost $1,000 worth of some of the best kit I&#8217;ve ever used, and GuraGear is just giving it away, no strings attached. All you have to do is leave a comment on my blog. How easy is&nbsp;<em>that?</em></strong></h4>



<p>Just keep scrolling to the comments and tell me you&#8217;re in. Say &#8220;Pick me!&#8221; or &#8220;Thank you&#8221; or &#8220;I like bears.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t matter what you say; just tell me you want your name in the draw. Want bonus points? You could make sure you&#8217;re following <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gura.gear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@gura.gear</a> and me (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidduchemin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@davidduchemin</a>) on Instagram. It won&#8217;t increase your chance of winning, but we&#8217;d feel the love, and you can&#8217;t have too much love these days.</p>



<p>I use every one of these bags and pouches almost every day that I&#8217;m working and travelling. My relationship with <a href="https://guragear.com/?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gura Gear</a> is a long one, and I&#8217;ve bought most of these bags with my own money because they&#8217;re worth every penny. But I&#8217;m excited for some of you to get your hands on them. I&#8217;ll do the draw on February 07 and announce the&nbsp;winners with an update to this post here on my blog on February 08.<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br>For the Love of the Photograph,<br>David</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was about to photograph a beautiful family of&nbsp;cheetah in gorgeous morning light when my camera returned an error message and wouldn&#8217;t—no matter what I did—focus. It wouldn&#8217;t even fire. By the time I got my lens swapped onto another body, the action was all over, and I was down a camera at the beginning of a month-long trip. Or was I?<br><br>Back at camp, I discovered the problem: the flange on the camera, the one to which my lenses mount, was loose and needed a small, very particular screwdriver to fix it. Fortunately, I had one, and I was back up and running. It wasn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve needed something like this to get me out of a jam. A screwdriver or a bit of crazy glue to put my eyeglasses back together. An Arca-Swiss plate for when I&#8217;ve lost one, or—more likely—the bolt I need to attach it. A swab to clean my&nbsp;sensor. Enter the Oh Sh*t Kit.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Prefer to watch a less articulate video version of this short article? You can watch it below. </em><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="x-resp-embed x-is-video x-is-vimeo"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Oh-Shit-Kit" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1134319094?h=64e89f9817&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="864" height="486" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p><br>A couple of weeks ago, I sent out a quick video about all the stuff you&#8217;d find in my camera bag if you went digging through it and overlooked the obvious gear like cameras and lenses. <a href="https://davidduchemin.com/2025/12/everything-but-the-cameras/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">You can still watch that video or read the article here.</a></p>



<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been preparing for the coming year, making sure all my gear is where I think it is, and checking that things like the toiletry and pharma kits&nbsp;I take on every trip are stocked with everything&nbsp;I use during a year of travel. And while I was going through it,&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;perhaps there&#8217;s more I could show you, and that it might help those of you who travel to make photographs.</p>



<p>One of the strategies I&#8217;ve found most helpful is thinking in terms of kits. I have a toiletry kit, a pharma kit, a cable kit, a prosthetics kit, and an Oh Sh*t kit. I know what&#8217;s in each, and instead of a packing list that has a bunch of individual items like toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, sunscreen, dental floss, etc., I have one item: toiletry kit. Same with my cable kit. I never have to guess or even double-check that I have my laptop&#8217;s USB-C cable or the one that charges my Apple watch. They&#8217;re all in there, and I <em>only </em>use them for travel. So when &#8220;cable kit&#8221; appears on my packing list, I throw it in the bag and know that it&#8217;s all there.</p>



<p>The only restocking I need to do happens after a trip. I check it all, add more Tylenol or sunblock, replace anything that got lost or broken, and I&#8217;m always ready to go. One of the kits I&#8217;ve had with me the longest, and which has gone through many iterations, is my Oh Sh*t Kit. This used to be a lot more robust, but over the years I&#8217;ve pared it down or split it into other kits. It used to contain a first-aid kit, but now it lives in my camera bag, whereas the Oh Sh*t Kit lives in my duffel, and if I&#8217;m lucky, I won&#8217;t need it at all.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Your kit will reflect your particular needs and will account for&nbsp;how remote your work is. But here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in mine, circa 2026.</strong></h4>

<p>My own kit is contained in a <a href="https://amzn.to/438Ymm8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lochby Venture Pouch</a> (above) . It&#8217;s not too big, it nestles into my duffle bag anywhere there&#8217;s room, and it&#8217;s got some nice internal organization. You put all this in a ziploc bag if you wanted; it&#8217;s what&#8217;s inside that really matters but I have a number of Lochby products and I really like them.</p>



<p>One side of the pouch contains:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Small microfiber towel, as much for padding as anything else.<br></li>



<li>2 spare insulin pens in case my others break or get stolen by a monkey.<br></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/47mgJ9N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gerber Dime multi-tool</a>. This usually goes into the camera bag when I arrive on location so TSA doesn&#8217;t take it from me. This has a bunch of handy little tools, including a little set of pliers and scissors which I use more than the other tools combined.<br></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4ooeMQa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrench set from Small Rig </a>that has hex wrenches and a couple screwdrivers for things like tripod heads, and in my case, my prosthetic leg.<br></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4nyFJiN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HOTO Precision screwdriver set</a> that comes with 24 different bits, including those really small Phillips, torx and hex bits you need for things like cameras and eyeglasses. I love this little thing and it replaces the handful of tools I once carried.<br></li>



<li><a href="https://www.benchmade.com/products/533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benchmade Mini Bug Out</a> pocket knife: super simple, just shy of a 3&#8243; blade, and it weighs only 1.5 ounces or about 43 grams. Like the little multi-tool, I keep this in here until I get where I&#8217;m going. One less thing to remember to pack and one less thing to lose to TSA.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>In the other side of the pouch I have all the little things:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>spare Arca-Swiss plate</li>



<li>spare lens cloth</li>



<li>Zeiss lens wipes</li>



<li>sensor swabs and sensor solution</li>



<li>small vials of Crazy glue</li>



<li>extra business cards</li>



<li>very small bag of extra bolts, screws and bits and pieces for tripods, camera cages, and straps</li>



<li>2 x CR2032 batteries for my remote triggers</li>



<li>pocket-sized duct tape</li>
</ul>



<p>I also used to&nbsp;have a spare pair of eyeglasses in a larger version of this kit, but I keep those in my carry-on now because they do me no good in the cargo hold&nbsp;if I need them while travelling, but I never go far from home without them. I also used to have a small sewing kit, but I&#8217;ve never really had a sewing emergency that would stop me from doing my work, so&nbsp;somewhere along the way, I stopped carrying it.</p>



<p>What about you? Do you bring an emergency kit of any kind when you travel? What&#8217;s in your version of your Oh Sh*t Kit? <a href="https://davidduchemin.com/?p=21216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I&#8217;d love to hear about it. Am I missing anything?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>A couple years ago I was doing a little moonlighting for a small computer and imaging company that rhymes with Snapple. They were under the mistaken impression that my nearly 40 years behind the camera meant I know what I&#8217;m talking about. But what a fun gig! One of my first tasks as their Creative Storytelling Specialist (yeah, I still don&#8217;t know what that means, either) was to help the engineers understand mood as it relates to picture-making.<br><br>So to get a head start, I did some poking around the internet in hopes that people with greater minds than I had already articulated the idea of mood. Mostly what I found was the advice to &#8220;put more mood in your photographs,&#8221; as if I were being told to add more salt to every recipe. Not helpful.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The problem with mood is it&#8217;s not really one thing. Add mood? What kind of mood? If mood is about emotional connection then surely we can be more specific about <em>which</em> emotions. And how do we do that?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><br>Before we disregard the advice entirely, it&#8217;s worth acknowledging that it comes from a good place, a recognition of the power of mood.<br><br>The desire for more mood in our photographs—not unlike the desire for more salt—is a desire for more <em>flavour</em>. Only in this case, the flavour is emotion. It&#8217;s a desire to move beyond the pursuit of perfection in our images toward something a little more poetic. Poetry is about feelings; unless you&#8217;re working as a forensic photographer, feelings are probably something you hope to stir with your photographs. And that requires interpretation. It requires making choices that sway an emotion one way or the other. It requires taking some risks because almost every choice that leads to more emotion in our images is a choice that deviates from the playbook we were all given with our first cameras. It&#8217;s a move away from average and towards more flavour. Pass the salt, please.<br><br>So back to my early efforts to articulate mood as a powerful tool (more like a toolbox, really) in photographic expression. Once I got over the confusion about why so little insightful information was out there, here are the first three realizations I had.<br><br><strong>You Can <em>Learn</em> Mood</strong><br><br>Mood isn&#8217;t the result of secret techniques, or even <em>advanced</em> techniques. It&#8217;s more a result of refined sensibilities. Maybe it&#8217;s also a matter of priority. It&#8217;s in looking for it, chasing it. It&#8217;s in recognizing it when you see it and knowing which choices can amplify those emotions through the image. And those are all present as visual cues that we can see and learn from. You <em>can </em>learn this.<br><br>Set the camera aside for a moment and think about a photograph that you love—one that stirs something in you. Maybe one of the iconic images that made so many of us feel the power of the photograph and want to pick up the camera ourselves so we could find that power and beauty. What makes you feel the way you do about that photograph? Is it only the subject matter?</p>



<p>I love bears, but not every picture of a bear makes me feel anything. Some make me feel bored. They lack mood. But the ones I love? It&#8217;s more than a bear. Bear in great light, perhaps. What kind of light is it, and what did the photographer do with it? Maybe it&#8217;s a bear in a great moment. Maybe it&#8217;s the camera placement or a story implied by other elements in the frame. Maybe—probably—it&#8217;s all that. Whatever it is, you feel it because of something you see. And if it&#8217;s something you can see, it&#8217;s something you can learn.<br><br>In short, don&#8217;t spend more time studying your technical tools than you spend figuring out your mood tools.<br><br><strong>Light Is Everything</strong><br><br>The first thing we look to when we chase mood is light. And so it should be. Light is so often the first thing that hooks us. We feel something about light that resonates with us. We feel differently about backlight than about front-lit scenes. We feel differently about softer light than light that&#8217;s more direct and makes harsh shadows. We respond to the shadows and reflections created by light. Where light is concerned, what we seem not to respond to is, well, <em>boring</em> light. <em>Average</em> light. That&#8217;s not to say you can’t make expressive photographs in boring light, but it won&#8217;t be light to which we respond but something else. A different hook. So if light is so powerful, why do photographers insist on painting with anything but light that has the power of an emotional hook? If you want mood, look to the light.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>It&#8217;s Not All About Light</strong><br><br>At the same time, it&#8217;s not<em> all </em>about light. There&#8217;s a reason photographers use different focal lengths, and it&#8217;s not just to &#8220;get more reach&#8221; or get more in the frame. It&#8217;s because different lenses <em>feel</em> differently. They interpret a scene differently. So do the places in which we put the camera. And the weather. And our choice of moment. Of course light isn&#8217;t truly everything. All our choices, all the elements, are everything.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And that&#8217;s the problem with &#8220;put more mood into your photographs.&#8221; It&#8217;s every decision we make—or it <em>can</em> be. </h4>



<p><br>But here&#8217;s the other problem with mood: there are no rules. There are hooks, elements and choices that we do or don’t respond to, but there&#8217;s no playbook. Not really. And so it comes down to having a sensitivity to those hooks, taking risks, and knowing what stirs the OMGILT (<em>Oh my God, I love that!</em>). Many things stir emotion in our images—and nearly infinite combinations of them—but you won&#8217;t love to use them all. You won&#8217;t love the same colours I do. You won&#8217;t be as excited by the same focal lengths or perspectives nor drawn to the same subjects or stories.<br><br><strong>Your Turn. There&#8217;s a Prize.</strong><br><br><em>Updated: Congratulations to Norma Grieve. Thank you all for playing. It&#8217;s so good to see people thinking about mood and the emotional impact of photographs. </em><br><br>Are you up for an exercise? How about if I put a prize on the line? In the comments below, tell me about that photograph I asked you to imagine a few paragraphs ago. Describe it. Tell me why you feel the way you do about it. It&#8217;s probably not just one thing, but many. What gives that photograph its mood, or what makes you feel the way you do about it? Don&#8217;t hold back. I&#8217;ll draw one person’s name from the comments below for a free enrollment in my next course, which may or may not be available very soon and is all about mood and making photographs that elicit a more powerful emotional response. Who&#8217;s in?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>Photography can be many things. For some, it&#8217;s about capturing scenes. For me, it&#8217;s about conveying emotions and suggesting narratives that resonate deeply, first with me and then with the viewers who might experience the image. I&#8217;m not so much after eyes as I am hearts and minds. Mood does that.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The mood of a photograph is its emotional tone—a subtle yet powerful element that can transform a simple image into a compelling one that is more than visual but also visceral.</strong></h4>



<p><br>Mood in photography refers to the overall feeling or atmosphere an image evokes in the viewer, ranging from joy and serenity to tension and melancholy. As broad as the gamut of human emotions is, so too is the possibility of touching them with a photograph. Mood is the intangible quality of a photograph, often created by a combination of many elements, a short list of which would include light and composition, the subject matter itself, and colour. But that is a very abbreviated list of how we can establish an emotional connection—to make photographs that are more expressive on the level that makes us sigh, laugh, cry, or feel wonder when we see them.</p>



<p>For those who aim to tell stories with their images (and not all of us do), an image that successfully conveys a mood can evoke empathy, curiosity, or nostalgia, drawing the viewer into the story behind the photograph. Making them care. Investing them.</p>



<p>Mood can also play a significant role in guiding the viewer’s perception and interpretation of an image. It acts as a lens through which a visual story is understood. It changes a photograph <em>of</em> something into a photograph <em>about</em> something more specific. For instance, a photograph of a deserted house might evoke feelings of loneliness or melancholy, suggesting themes of abandonment or loss. But the same scene captured with warm lighting and vibrant colours might create a nostalgic or serene mood, changing the narrative entirely. Through mood, photographers can steer the viewer’s emotional response and shape the story being told. Both hypothetical images I just mentioned are of the same thing, but they are <em>about </em>very different things. That&#8217;s the power of mood.</p>



<p>Beyond storytelling and emotional engagement, understanding and pursuing mood can just make prettier photographs. Stronger images aesthetically. Images that stand out more because they have a distinct visual identity. Whether it’s the ethereal quality of a foggy landscape or the raw energy of a stormy sea, mood adds depth and character to photographs, making them more memorable and impactful.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mood is often what first captures the viewer’s attention—the hook that draws viewers in to explore the image further.</strong></h4>



<p><br>Complicated images with a lot going on can take a while to figure out. The impact is spread out and sometimes doesn&#8217;t hit as powerfully. Mood is simple; it&#8217;s a <em>feeling</em> that requires no figuring out. Mood is seldom a puzzle.</p>



<p>In portrait photography, mood can be used to reveal a subject’s unique personality or telegraph how they feel. It can connect us to a subject we might not otherwise care about. The landscape photographer relies on mood to transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary vistas, capturing the essence of a place—the feeling of it. Documentary photographers use mood to make us feel empathy about social issues. Any photographer wanting their audience to feel something would be foolish to assume that subject matter alone will provoke empathy when there are much more powerful tools available, among which might be choice of moment, point of view, or the brightness of an image.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mood brings emotional depth; it is the life of an image.</strong></h4>



<p><br>For me, mood is often the <em>why</em>. It&#8217;s what draws me to make the photograph in the first place. And so it is perhaps a source of consternation or confusion when I look at the work of photographers new to this craft, and even back on years of my early work and see no mood. What power they might have had if only these photographers (and I) understood the possibilities. If only I had asked better questions than, “Which lens should I use?” or “What would a proper exposure be for this?”</p>



<p>When you first start out, it&#8217;s probably helpful that your questions relate to focus, exposure, or lens choice. But I&#8217;m increasingly convinced those questions should never be separated from this better one: <em>How do you want the image to feel?</em> Because even where focus and exposure (and lens choice) are concerned, your choices about <em>how</em> can never be separated from your choices about <em>why</em>. If I can see it, I can feel it. So if you make an image darker, I will feel that darkness and its accompanying mood. If your focus is so shallow that the out-of-focus highlights become globes of light and colour and the rest of the scene softens, I will feel that too. Or if your focus is so shallow I can&#8217;t see enough detail to make sense of the story, I won&#8217;t feel the power of that story. Not a single decision we make—either in camera or with development—can&#8217;t be used to make an image that is as visceral as it is visual.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Two questions that will change the way you make photographs: How do you want the image to feel? What would that look like?</strong></h4>



<p><br>If you’re open to a quick exercise, answer these two questions for me: </p>



<p>What do you love that conveys mood in an image? <br><br>What makes your heart skip a beat? <br><br>Many of the elements and choices that bring mood to an image are felt somewhat universally, but the ones we most like working with, the ones we most want to see in our images, are a matter of preference. I&#8217;d love to hear what those mood hooks are for you. My top three would have to be backlight, point of view, and the mystery that shadows create in an image. What are yours? You can drop those into the comments below. <br><br>For the Love of the Photograph,<br>David</p>The post <a href="https://davidduchemin.com/2025/12/the-power-of-mood/">The Power of Mood</a> first appeared on <a href="https://davidduchemin.com">David duChemin - Photographer, Author, Creative Instigator</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5 Ways to Greater Competence &amp; Control</h3>



<p><br>In <a href="https://davidduchemin.com/?p=21190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my last dispatch</a>, I talked about competence, hoping that asking &#8220;Is my work getting better?&#8221; might lead you to more productive places in your craft than asking &#8220;Is it good?&#8221; I suggested that a first step might be to get&nbsp;better at the basics of your craft before running off all half-cocked to make &#8220;art.&#8221; Baby steps, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;Craft&#8221; is a hypernym, an umbrella word covering a hundred different ideas and techniques, and it might be helpful to narrow it down a bit—and since nothing will ruin a potentially good photograph like blowing the exposure, I&#8217;ve got five&nbsp;ideas for you, or things you can change or work on, to gain competence with&nbsp;and control of&nbsp;your exposure. Remember: competence leads to confidence, and since confidence opens the way to experimentation and play, it&#8217;s one doorway to greater creativity and stronger photographs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drop the Brightness</strong></h4>



<p><br>If you&#8217;re one of those photographers who cranks the brightness up on your back-of-camera LCD or your electronic viewfinder (EVF), then it&#8217;s time for some tough love: knock it off. Or rather, knock it down. If you want your images to look brighter on the LCD, then there&#8217;s a better way: make them actually brighter by giving them more exposure. Cranking the LCD up won&#8217;t help.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re happily shooting away with a really bright LCD/EVF, you&#8217;re also probably wildly underexposing because you &#8220;think it looks good.&#8221; It won&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Your LCD/EVF is fantastic for seeing composition, not for judging the brightness of an image. It&#8217;s the same reason we don&#8217;t use our laptop or desktop displays at full brightness; 50% is usually about right. You do all your development, it looks great, you print it, and whoa! Why&#8217;s it so dark? It&#8217;s dark because your monitor (LCD/EVF) is too bright, and it&#8217;s giving you a false impression.</p>



<p>Dial your LCD/EVF brightness down to 50% and&nbsp;you&#8217;ll begin exposing differently.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turn on the Blinkies!</strong></h4>



<p><br>Before I return to the &#8220;don&#8217;t use your LCD/EVF for judging your exposure&#8221; lecture, grab your camera and make sure your blinkies or highlight warnings are all turned on. Don&#8217;t know how? Just Google your camera model and the words &#8220;how to turn on highlight alerts.&#8221; Three&nbsp;minutes on YouTube will have you sorted out.</p>



<p>Your blinkies will not only tell you that parts of the image are overexposed, they&#8217;ll also tell you <em>which</em> parts and give you the ability to decide if that&#8217;s what you want or not. Specular highlights glinting off something metallic? That&#8217;s probably OK, since there&#8217;s no detail in there anyway, and trying to reclaim them will make the rest of the picture way too dark. But a wide patch of blinkies on the forehead of your portrait subject? Not so much. Dial your exposure down until that goes away.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re shooting in RAW, you&#8217;ve got some leeway to recover those lost highlight details later in development, but not so much that you can afford to be lazy about this. My blinkies are always on, and they are a big help when I get distracted by other things.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn to Use the Histogram</strong></h4>



<p><br>If you can&#8217;t use your LCD/EVF brightness to judge exposure (you can&#8217;t), what do you use? The histogram. This is a non-negotiable for digital photographers: you <em>must</em> learn to read your histogram. It&#8217;s the only way to know what your exposure is doing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-fij8irAzI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I did a video about this 10 years ago, and you can see it here</a>. It&#8217;s not the worst explanation ever, but if histograms are a mystery to you, consider spending some time watching several videos about this so you really understand it.</p>



<p>My histogram is always visible in my viewfinder, and I keep an eye on it constantly.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Consider Using M+Auto-ISO</strong></h4>



<p><br>Now might be a good time to wean yourself off Aperture or Shutter priority mode and go fully manual (sort of). The control you gain from this will serve you for the rest of your life.</p>



<p>A few years ago, a friend showed me how he had recently learned to expose: set the shutter speed manually, set the aperture manually, then turn on Auto-ISO. &#8220;No way,&#8221; I said. And then I tried it, and I haven&#8217;t looked back since. Why? Total control over the settings that make the most difference to the way a photograph looks and feels. I always know what those two settings are doing to my image; the camera doesn&#8217;t get to change them. Ever. But ISO? Well, now that our sensors are so good and noise reduction software has come so far, I don&#8217;t even think twice about it. My max ISO is set to 12,800, and I&#8217;m careful to nail my exposure (see points 1, 2, and 3 above), and I let the ISO go where it needs to (mostly—see below). This approach means I control what&#8217;s important, and the camera still helps with exposure.</p>



<p>Shutter and aperture are something <em>you</em> should decide, not your camera. ISO is less important. Switching to this way of shooting means fewer surprises and greater control. Almost every photographer I know who shoots this way wouldn&#8217;t go back. Give it a try.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn to Use Your EV Compensation</strong></h4>



<p><br>Any photographer using any auto mode (including what I described above) needs to understand and use EV compensation. I&#8217;ve programmed my cameras to control the EV compensation with a small scroll wheel on the back, easily the most accessible control on my camera. I set my shutter and aperture,&nbsp;and let the camera control the exposure with ISO. But I keep an eye on my blinkies and always watch my histogram, and when the camera doesn&#8217;t make the same decision I would have, I step in and spin the EV Compensation wheel. A little lighter. A little darker.</p>



<p>Exposure Value compensation, or EV comp, is your way of telling the camera, &#8220;Hey, nice try, but I want this one to be two stops darker or brighter,&#8221; and the camera (if you&#8217;re shooting as above) will then raise or lower the ISO as needed. It won&#8217;t touch shutter or aperture because you control those manually. And if it&#8217;s too bright and your ISO can&#8217;t go any lower, the camera will blink a warning. Same if it&#8217;s too dark and the ISO can&#8217;t go higher. And then you can decide what to do with your shutter or aperture to correct that. (<em>Note: when I say the camera will blink a warning, I don&#8217;t in this case mean the blinkies. The exposure information, probably at the bottom of your screen, will blink to tell you it can&#8217;t give you a proper exposure with the settings you&#8217;ve set</em>).</p>



<p>You must learn to use your EV compensation when using any auto or program mode: it&#8217;s your <em>only</em> way to tell the camera you want a little more or a little less&nbsp;exposure. A quick Google search with your camera model and &#8220;EV compensation&#8221; ought to get you there if you don&#8217;t know where to find this on your camera. It&#8217;s usually on a button with a +/- symbol.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In Real Life</strong></h4>



<p><br>The &#8220;make it brighter&#8221; button in real life is a bit&nbsp;harder to find, but I&#8217;m convinced it lies in our choice to be kind to one another, to show empathy, compassion, and generosity: qualities that feel conspicuously in short supply these days. Qualities we&#8217;ve always celebrated at this time of year, and which—I&#8217;m convinced—are the secret to the yet-unrealized dream of peace on Earth, if it&#8217;s ever going to come at all. But in the meantime, it can get pretty dark, and this year&#8217;s been a tough one. Spin the dial on that exposure compensation, knock the kindness up a little. Photographers, of all people, should be particularly sensitive to the beauty of light. I wish you all the light you can get, the happiest of holidays, and a new year filled with love.</p>



<p><em>I hope this helps. If you&#8217;ve got questions, or just want to say hello, I&#8217;d love to hear from you in the comments below.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br>The holidays are coming and though this is not about that, there might something in here that you could give to your favourite photographer, especially if that&#8217;s you! This is decidedly less philosophical than some of my blog posts, but I thought I&#8217;d show you what&#8217;s in my camera bag. Not the cameras and lenses, but the other stuff, the little things that I&#8217;ve learned to bring with me to make life just a little easier, and sometimes safer.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re short on time, and you just want the list, keep reading, but if you&#8217;ve got a couple minutes, join me in my studio through the video below and let&#8217;s talk about it.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Of course it all depends what I&#8217;m photographing and where, but as my work leans more towards the outdoors and wilder subjects, you&#8217;ll see that reflected in this list. Here are the little extra things you&#8217;ll almost always find in my my bag (my camera bag is a <a href="https://guragear.com/products/kiboko-v2-0-30l?ref=tezywyhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GuraGear Kiboko 30L</a>, I love these bags and have used them for over 15 years. Use DUCHEMIN when you check out and you&#8217;ll save 10%).<br><br>The links below are Amazon affiliate links. If you use them Jeff Bezos has to buy me a coffee. Apologies in advance if some of the links don&#8217;t go to the specific product, but most of them should work fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. <a href="https://amzn.to/4o7DXGr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dry-bag, Sea to Summit, 35L</strong>&nbsp;</a><br>Great for protecting the camera in rain, or sitting on, or collecting trailside trash, etc. A million uses.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Small first aid kit</strong>, with some Tylenol and a tick-remover added. I can&#8217;t find this on Amazon but there many similar kits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a link to t<a href="https://amzn.to/3WsjH6l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he Original Tick Key</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. <strong>Way too many lens cloths.&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4oIv720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Something like these.</a> I like the larger size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. <strong>Headlamp, or flashlight</strong>, specifically one that&#8217;s chargeable by USB. <a href="https://amzn.to/47rBteO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">My headlamp is by NEBO </a>and I really like it. The <a href="https://amzn.to/4qutkPv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuben G5 is also good</a>, though it&#8217;s not a headlamp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Apple air tags</p>



<p>6. Journal and pen.&nbsp;I like <a href="https://amzn.to/48UEPtv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these journals in Lochby covers</a>.</p>



<p>7. Buff / Neck gaiter. <a href="https://amzn.to/4qvE2W6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I like this one</a>, but there are hundreds of different kinds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><br><a href="https://davidduchemin.com/2025/11/stop-making-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Two weeks ago, I suggested you stop asking if your photographs are good and that you not concern yourself with whether they are or are not art.</a> I advocated a more playful approach guided by what you love and what brings you joy. I argued that the growth in your craft could be channelled by that love because the more you love doing something, the more you do it, and the more you learn. Or so I believe.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t remove the need for excellence in our evolution, nor does it&nbsp;mean we can&#8217;t all become&nbsp;more aware of our blind spots. We all have them, and many of us come through them faster because of a little tough love—a moment, perhaps, when someone looks at our work, sees what we do not, and gently nudges us in a stronger direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I get a lot of emails. Many of them ask me the same thing: &#8220;Could you please look at my work and tell me if it&#8217;s any good?&#8221; I am very conscious in those moments of both the vulnerability required to ask someone this question and of the hurtful power of a misplaced word.</p>



<p>Too many artists, young in their craft&nbsp;if not in their years, have been derailed by the insensitivity of a more experienced photographer trying to hold the line in the cause of excellence. I hear about it happening all the time in camera clubs, but the same kind of comments have come from competition judges and the usual unsolicited comments from small-hearted people online. I try to be very careful with my words, but here&#8217;s the direction I try to steer those conversations:Before your work can be good, it must first become competent, and competence is a hard stage through which to pass, especially for those of us for whom patience is in short supply.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A better question than &#8220;Is it good?&#8221; is&nbsp;&#8220;Is it getting better?&#8221;</strong></h4>



<p><br>That&#8217;s a tough question that requires some thick skin if you&#8217;re going to hear the answer clearly enough to act on it. It&#8217;s also a question that will serve you well in your craft; it tells me you are open to change, that you know there&#8217;s room to grow, and that you&#8217;re more excited about where you&#8217;re going than where you&#8217;ve been. So when someone points out the sensor spots you didn&#8217;t see or the crooked horizon you didn&#8217;t notice, you think, &#8220;Fantastic; I can watch for those!&#8221; and take one step closer to competence.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;<strong>Much of competence is in paying attention. And growth in competence is learning what to pay attention to.</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p><br>The small things matter. You must pay enough attention to your work that you see the sensor spots. I know, we all miss one now and then, but when I see obvious sensor spots or crooked horizons, it tells me you&#8217;re not looking at the picture; you&#8217;re not <em>seeing </em>it. You might be looking at the subject, beautiful as it is, and you might be looking at your memory of the moment, but you aren&#8217;t looking at the <em>picture</em>. See what I mean?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It&#8217;s not about the spots. It&#8217;s about a lack of observation.</strong></h4>



<p><br>If I look at your picture and see a lack of critical sharpness, I stop looking for &#8220;good&#8221; because the competence isn&#8217;t there yet. I don&#8217;t mean some creative use of focus, like that slight motion blur you get that makes an image feel a little more alive, I mean the kind where you just blew your choice of shutter speed, or you missed the focus just enough to make me feel like my eyes can&#8217;t focus on an element that should be sharp. It&#8217;s blurry, plain and simple, and your pictures deserve better than that. You shouldn&#8217;t be showing your work at this stage; you should be <em>learning from it.</em></p>



<p>When you&#8217;re chasing &#8220;good,&#8221; you shouldn&#8217;t still need someone to tell you it&#8217;s not in focus&nbsp;or that you&#8217;ve well and truly blown the exposure in critical areas. You probably shouldn&#8217;t need me to tell you to back off on the oversaturation slider, the white vignettes, or the choice to use (God help us) selective colour, but that one might be a different conversation. I&#8217;ve certainly made my own mistakes in matters of taste over the years&nbsp;before learning from them. Competence and taste are not the same thing, but the more competent I have become, the less I&#8217;ve needed the crutch I once found in the digital un-suck filters or the gimmicks on which so many rely instead of just learning the principles of craft, composition, and storytelling.</p>



<p>This all sounds so harsh, I know. I&#8217;ve tried to soften it as best as I can. But hang on a moment, and don&#8217;t get hurt by this. Competence is not a consolation prize; it&#8217;s your <em>foundation—</em>and you can&#8217;t bluff or shortcut your way through it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Competence is the craft itself, and you can&#8217;t skip the craft just to &#8220;get to the good stuff.&#8221;</strong></h4>



<p><br>It&#8217;s like learning a language. Yes, once you&#8217;re fluent, you&#8217;ll be able to write poems, be creative, and play fast and loose with the vocabulary and grammar. But if you&#8217;re not there yet, the most unkind thing I could do is tell you that you are. Doing so would stop you from something truly good: getting better.</p>



<p>You can approach your craft playfully and still learn. You can make what you love and aspire to make work that is stronger still. The questions we ask matter. They drive our motivation and our behaviour, and you will be better served by questions that honour you and the craft you love more than they serve your ego.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&#8220;Am I becoming more competent,&nbsp;and is my work getting better?&#8221; These questions will take you so much further than &#8220;Is it good?&#8221;</strong></h4>



<p><br>Practically, this is a matter of what you chase: praise or growth. Happily, I think we can have both, though it will come from different people. Most of us have people in our lives who say things like, &#8220;Wow, this should be in National Geographic!&#8221; They mean well, though they haven&#8217;t seen an issue of NG in 20 years. This praise tells you someone resonated with your photograph, and that&#8217;s no small thing. You&#8217;re on the right path! Those voices can provide the fuel to keep going, but they aren&#8217;t the voices to listen to if you want to know how far down that path you really are, and what your next moves might be if you want to go further.</p>



<p>It is hard, but freeing, to be so honest with your work that you can ask where it lacks and what you can improve—and to truly welcome the answers—instead of the need for validation, which often creates (rather than allowing us to see past) the kind of blind spots that keep us from growing.<br><br>For the Love of the Photograph,<br>David.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>My photography is never so difficult and robbed of its joy as when I try too hard to make it &#8220;good&#8221; (whatever that means) or worse: to make &#8220;art.</strong>&#8220;</h4>



<p><br>The moment I focus my concern on the outcome of what I am making or how it is received by others, my work becomes rigid and self-conscious. Not only does the picture-making become more difficult (and the resulting photographs less infused with life), it all becomes so much less enjoyable, weighed down with my own unrealistic expectations and the imagined expectations of others. I know I&#8217;m not the only one who feels this way.</p>



<p>In the moment, it&#8217;s hard enough to make technically competent choices&nbsp;and to make those decisions playfully&nbsp;as I work to see what magic might exist between the camera, the scene, and the subject—but near impossible to do that while listening to the monkeys chattering in the back of my brain and telling me that what I&#8217;m making isn&#8217;t worth the pixels.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never liked monkeys. I make a living helping others tame their mental monkeys, while mine get routinely out of control, running amok and throwing poo in the hallways of my creative process.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>My advice (if not to you then to me)&nbsp;is this: stop trying so hard to make art. Stop worrying about whether it&#8217;s good or not.&nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t matter.</strong></h4>



<p><br>Here&#8217;s how it works: you learn your craft, study the masters, and practice new things. As you do, your skill improves, your tastes change, and what lights you up on the inside evolves. You never have to answer to the monkeys; you don&#8217;t have to worry about whether it&#8217;s &#8220;art&#8221; or even &#8220;good.&#8221; You just have to make something that thrills you. And keep working on the craft. Keep learning.</p>



<p>If you let &#8220;good&#8221; stop you, you&#8217;ll never grow or improve. No one makes good photographs at first.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Want stronger photographs? Make more of them. Ignore the monkeys slapping labels on it.</strong></h4>



<p><br>Something happens when many of us (ok, maybe it&#8217;s just me, but keep reading in case it applies) make a picture we like. We start looking around, hoping others like it too. If they like it, then it confirms we made something good. Cue the dopamine. But if not, well, no more dopamine for you. Those happy feelings are replaced with self-doubt, and we second-guess our affection for what we just made, rather than trusting it.  </p>



<p>When we lose the thrill of play, we resort to rules. When we doubt the calibration of our own desires and preferences, we look to others to confirm the merit of our work. Rules are reliable, but they&#8217;ll keep you moving in circles around the tastes and opinions of others; they won&#8217;t pull you forward into who you&#8217;re becoming.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But at least you&#8217;ll know if your work is &#8220;good&#8221; or not, right? Well, no. You&#8217;ll know that it <em>conforms&nbsp;</em>to what others expect from art or so-called good photography, and if creative efforts are to conform to anything, it should be to one thing only: the contours of your own soul and mind.</strong></h4>



<p><br>Even as I write this, the Craft Police in my mind are getting their panties in a twist. &#8220;If everything is good,&#8221; I can hear them say, &#8220;then nothing is good!&#8221; I want excellence in my work as much as the next person. I just don&#8217;t need the approval of others or a list of standards or rules to get there, and neither do you.</p>



<p>As you grow in your craft, you will hit important milestones. At some point, unintentionally crooked horizons will become distracting to you, and you&#8217;ll stop doing it. Not because it&#8217;s a rule, but because you notice them now and you don&#8217;t like them. Same with sensor spots and a lack of critical sharpness in areas that really should be sharp. I know Cartier-Bresson said &#8220;sharpness is a bourgeois concept,&#8221; but he didn&#8217;t believe that so strongly that he stopped focusing his lens. When you need it to be sharp, you&#8217;ll know because it&#8217;ll drive you to distraction when it&#8217;s not, and it won&#8217;t be for the sake of the rules; it&#8217;ll be because you just don&#8217;t like the blurry results anymore. If you&#8217;re paying attention and you are growing in your craft, you will evolve into excellence.</p>



<p>At some point, you&#8217;ll become dissatisfied with repeating yourself, and that dissatisfaction will draw you forward into new efforts. You won&#8217;t be trying to make art; you&#8217;ll just want something different from your work. And that desire will lead you to play with wider apertures or slower shutter speeds. It might lead you to more spacious compositions&nbsp;or to give more attention to the energy in your frame, not because one result is objectively good and another is not, but because one satisfies you and the other falls flat, which is curious because last year you really resonated with techniques and results that now feel a little less alive to you.</p>



<p>The thing is, in between the realization that the old efforts no longer satisfy and whatever stage comes next, there can be an incredible liminal stage—an in-between place in your growth that is not quite one or the other but is full of play and curiosity and is unencumbered by expectations because you really don&#8217;t have any yet for this new creative place you&#8217;ve arrived in. It is in this stage—if you don&#8217;t overthink it—that you make the discoveries that will be the hallmarks of your new work. It&#8217;ll be in this playful exploration that you find the joy that you always get when things are going well, and you love what you think the work is becoming. Not because it&#8217;s <em>good</em>, not because it&#8217;s <em>art</em>. But because you&nbsp;<em>love</em> it. And maybe you don&#8217;t even love the results, but love the effort of trying—and in doing so, you learn what works and what doesn&#8217;t, and you try again because you love the trying.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is there a better way to evaluate what we make? Is there a better reason for pursuing it and doing more of it? I can&#8217;t think of any.</strong></h4>



<p><br>I don&#8217;t know if what I make is art, or if others will see it that way. I guess it&#8217;s a matter of definition, but I like to think it qualifies. From image to image, I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s any good, whatever that means. But I know when it&#8217;s <em>mine</em>. I know when I <em>love</em> it. I know when I have loved <em>making</em> it, and that act of creativity has taken me to new places. And I know that no matter how good I (or the monkeys) judge it to be, my assessment might change in a year or two; it&#8217;ll no longer satisfy, and that hunger will push me ever forward to making work that has meaning to me and brings me joy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I also know that when I start worrying about how good it is, I stiffen up. I become less playful. I make photographs that are less good, less &#8220;me,&#8221; and less fun to make. The creative spark is easily quenched. If anything, &#8220;Is it good?&#8221; is a later question, not a camera-in-hand question.</strong></h4>



<p><br>Don&#8217;t worry about the art and whether your images are, or aren&#8217;t. Pick up the camera and play. Learn something new and incorporate that into your play. See where your ideas lead and make lots of crappy sketch images that lead to unexpected surprises. If your first instinct is to look at the results and either gasp or giggle (or both), let that be enough.</p>



<p>For the Love of the Photograph,<br>David</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wildlife photography should be easy: get a long lens, put the critter in the frame and don&#8217;t screw up the exposure. Simple, right?</strong></h4>



<p><br>In the 20 years during which I have slid sideways into becoming a wildlife photographer, I have found myself both delighted and frustrated by the challenge of it. Surely if you know how to use a camera, the rest should be a matter of funding the lens and finding the animals. Beautiful creatures make for beautiful photographs, do they not?</p>



<p>Well, yes and no. Mostly no.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s a mistake to talk about picture-making as though our approach to it is determined by the stuff in the image. We don&#8217;t get a pass on weak composition just because the bear didn&#8217;t do what we hoped, nor does our picture only succeed because &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s a bear!&#8221; Sure, wildlife photographers have a weird thing for beanbags and we&#8217;re overly fond of khaki clothing, but the visual language we employ in our photographs is the same for all of us, and we don&#8217;t get a pass on bad composition or a lack of storytelling because we&#8217;re working with exotic subjects. I&#8217;ve seen some bad photographs of some beautiful people, and so have you.</p>



<p>Visual design doesn&#8217;t work differently with a lion than it does with a lamp: shape, colour, contrast, scale, balance, shutter speeds, and apertures&nbsp;all work the same, no matter the subject.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As much as subject matter is the point of what we do as wildlife photographers, it&#8217;s also the problem: it&#8217;s too easy to get seduced and see nothing else.</strong></h4>



<p><br>When we believe that our subject is so beautiful that &#8220;we just can&#8217;t take a bad picture of it,&#8221; we&#8217;re dangerously close to doing just that. I can&#8217;t be the only one to have seen (and made) thousands of weak photographs despite the beautiful subject in front of&nbsp;my camera.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m trying to get around to the stated intent of this article, which, if the title has anything to say about it, is giving you five&nbsp;ways to make stronger wildlife photographs. But other ideas keep getting in the way, so before I try one more time to get to the point(s), here&#8217;s one more diversion—a disclaimer, if you will: these are not quick fixes. The five&nbsp;ideas that follow might require a fundamental shift in what you do and how you do it, but&nbsp;they are not easy tweaks.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If easy tweaks are what you&#8217;re looking for, I defer you to Amazon for a mind-blowing selection of bean bags and khaki clothing.</strong></h4>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>1. More Time</strong></h3>



<p><br>You can&#8217;t photograph wildlife in the margins by&nbsp;taking a minute here or an hour there. Like no other subject I can think of, wildlife will demand time from you; if you want your photographs in the wild to get stronger, you must put in more time. More time means more photographs, more failures, and lessons learned. It means different weather and light. It means different behaviour from the animals, including the most challenging, which is simply their showing up in the first place.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You can spend money on the best lenses, but if you want to make a real difference in your photographs, you&#8217;ve got to spend the time.</strong><br></h4>

I waited for hours (days, really) for this wolf to appear, and then long, eternal minutes for him to step into the light.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Watch Your Background</strong></h3>



<p><br>Speaking of spending money on the best lenses, one reason&nbsp;photographers shell out the big shekels is to reduce cluttered backgrounds to pleasing bokeh, and faster (read: more expensive) lenses help do that. But so does paying attention to the background in the first place, positioning yourself to shoot&nbsp;towards something less cluttered, or waiting for the subject to move, which gives you more distance between them and the background to reduce&nbsp;the depth of field.</p>



<p>There are several tactics for controlling your background. What&#8217;s most important is that you make it a priority and obsess about it;&nbsp;it can&#8217;t be an afterthought.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The background is your canvas, and if it pulls my eye, it will also diminish my attention and my emotional response to your subject. Be uncompromising about this.</strong><br></h4>



<p></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. It&#8217;s Always the Light</strong></h3>



<p><br>While you&#8217;re being uncompromising about your canvas (your background), can I urge you to be as fastidious about your choice of paint? Light is our paint, and if I live 1,000 years, I&#8217;ll never understand why photographers are so willing just to take what comes their way instead of being proactive about the light in which they photograph.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t do anything about the light!&#8221; Yes, you can. You can go out earlier, in different weather. You can turn front light into backlight by changing positions. You can (tough love coming) put the camera down and wait for better light.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t have time!&#8221; Exactly. See my first point. What a waste of money to spend $16,000 on a long, fast lens, but cheap out when it comes to spending the time you need to be out there when the light is at its most compelling and emotive. Your photographs will improve when you make them with better paint.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It&#8217;s not <em>only</em> the light, but it&#8217;s <em>always</em> the light.</strong></h4>

What is great light for one image might not work for another. It&#8217;s rarely just the light, but the light always matters.&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Wait for the Action</strong></h3>



<p><br>There&#8217;s something appealing about that tight portrait of a leopard—the texture of the hair, the intensity of the gaze, the perceived proximity to something so powerful. I get it. But it can&#8217;t be all portraits, all the time. Not if you want to tell a bigger story&nbsp;and have a portfolio with some scope and rhythm. If you want story, then you&#8217;ve got to capture behaviour, and to do that, you need to wait (see my first point, again) for them to <em>do</em> something.</p>



<p>Wait for them to do what? Well, that&#8217;s up to you. What are you trying to show me with this photograph? Is it a bird landing on a branch,&nbsp;a bear shaking off the water after catching a fish, or&nbsp;the way the ears of a cat go flat and the pupils dilate when the animal sees prey? It could be anything, but make it something. If it interests you, it will probably interest me when I look at the photograph, but action and behaviour are where the story is.&nbsp;And the more you know it, the more you can predict it, and the more you can anticipate it, the better the chance you&#8217;ll have a story to tell me. Whatever you&#8217;re photographing, wait for it to <em>do</em> something.<br></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Look for Connection</strong></h3>



<p><br>Want to make a stronger photograph? Make me care. Fill it with emotion and story. Give me a catchlight in the eye—give me action or behaviour. Give me light that paints a mood. Give me connection. Get that camera to eye level. Wait for eye contact, either with me or with another animal. Show me the moments of intimacy. If they&#8217;re not doing something you care about—something that pulls at your emotions—there&#8217;s little chance others will care about it when they look at your pictures.<br></p>

<p><br>This list of ideas is not a pick and choose. It&#8217;s not about doing one of these, but doing <em>all</em> of them: finding a beautiful subject doing something that generates connection, painted with compelling light on a great background. For that, you need time. And not just time, but attention. Yes, get the long lens and nerd out on camouflage lens covers. It can&#8217;t hurt. Hell, get the best bean bag you can afford, but don&#8217;t mistake the sharp photograph you get as a result for the kind of pictures you might make if you paid more attention to what stirs the heart or mind to awe and wonder.<br><br>For the Love of the Photograph,<br>David</p>The post <a href="https://davidduchemin.com/2025/10/stronger-wildlife-photographs-5-ways/">Stronger Wildlife Photographs: 5 Ways</a> first appeared on <a href="https://davidduchemin.com">David duChemin - Photographer, Author, Creative Instigator</a>.]]></content:encoded>
