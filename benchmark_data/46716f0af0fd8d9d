<p>On January 7 and 8, 2025, Los Angeles was hit by a series of wildfires, driven by Santa Ana windstorms with gusts of 60 mph and more. One of them, the Eaton Fire (so named because it started near Eaton Canyon), destroyed the town of Altadena, which sits between Pasadena and the San Gabriel mountains. This fire eventually consumed over 14,000 acres and destroyed 7000+ buildings&#8212;mostly homes&#8212;in this community. Among the destroyed structures were our home and my studio; the latter contained 50+ years of origami, including artwork, books, paper, design notes, equipment, and more.</p>
<p>Despite those losses, we consider ourselves fortunate. We escaped with our lives and our animals (two dogs, three tortoises, a snake, and a tarantula), a few origami artworks of special significance to me, and my 19 design notebooks containing notes and diagrams from age 10 onward.</p>
<p>At this writing (January 16, 2025), we&#39;re in a hotel, working on finding a longer-term place to live not too far away. We plan to rebuild&#8212;both the home and the studio&#8212;but that is going to be a long process (if only because there are tens of thousands of people left homeless by the Eaton and Palisades fires all trying to do the same thing). Our spirits have remained high; we lean on each other to work, research, and joke as we handle the many, many chores that now lay in front of us. My (our) attitude is perhaps best summed up by this now-famous scene from a classic movie:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHPOzQzk9Qo">Always Look on the Bright Side of Life</a></p>
<p>In the first few days after the fire, I took some videos and subsequently put together a little writeup of those first crazy days of disaster and uncertainty. I&#39;ve copied it below.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-morning-after">The Morning After</h2>
<p>Late Tuesday afternoon, we heard about the Eaton Fire, which started over in Eaton Canyon, about 2 miles to our east and several ridges over. The initial reports were that the wind was driving the fire to the east (away from us), so we were hopeful. At about 6:30 pm, though, my neighbor texted the neighborhood group that he saw a glow over the ridge to our east, and I headed up to my studio to see. By 7:30 pm I saw the fire crest that ridge and we received the &quot;evacuate NOW&quot; notice, so I threw as much as I could grab into my car and headed down, while my wife did the same from our home (with the dogs, tortoises, snake, and tarantula that live with us).</p>
<p>We spent the next few hours driving and parking to try to watch things from a distance. Surprisingly, the evacuation zone ended just to the west of our neighborhood, so after a while, I started making my way to the edge of the zone, staying out of the way of the many emergency vehicles, and presently found a spot from which I could walk to the edge of the canyon that separated me from my studio. From there, I could see the studio; I could also see that the entire multi-thousand-foot mountainside above it was in sheets of flame. The wind was blasting through the canyons, driving 50-foot plumes of flame and embers horizontally. About 1:30 am, I saw a flare-up right at the studio, and within about 10 minutes, it was engulfed. I also realized about that time that the fire would likely take down the telephone poles (and thus, potentially live wires) along my route, so I beat a hasty retreat to my car, and before long, the authorities announced that our area was now evacuation zone. We drove down the hill to Pasadena, found a quiet neighborhood out of the smoke (and, we hoped, the path of the fire), and spent a fitful rest of the night in our cars, awaiting what the morning would bring.</p>
<p>In the morning, my wife stayed with the animals and I drove up the hill to see what became of our house. Major roads were blocked off, but I wove through the neighborhoods, dodging still-burning homes (though the worst was past), downed wires, downed trees, and random debris, until I could get up to my neighborhood. It was a zone of total devastation: nearly all homes burned&#8211;and definitely mine. (Actually, both of ours; we had just moved down the street, so both our old house&#8211;just moved out of&#8211;and the new house&#8211;just moved into&#8211;were leveled.) I made my way up to my studio at the top of the hill, passing street after street of nothing but smoldering ruins. When I made it up, I found something incredible: the row of houses below my studio had entirely survived! I texted their owners the good news. I could see, though, that my studio had not; I parked (debris blocked my driveway), walked up, and surveyed the destruction, took a few videos and pictures for records, then high-tailed it down the hill.</p>
<p>Right now, the estimates are that 7000 structures were damaged or destroyed. It looks like about 2/3 of Altadena is gone. There&#39;s a lot of snark on the internets about the rich people/celebrities/influencers in Pacific Palisades losing their houses. I haven&#39;t seen similar snark about Altadena, which is a mixed-class, mixed-race community. There are turn-of-the-century buildings, craftsman houses, bungalows, tiny starter homes, and yes, a few mansions leftover from the days when it was the summer playground of the rich. My wife grew up here; her father built their house himself in the 40s after clearing the orange groves from the parcel he bought. On the main drag downtown, the local hardware store was where you ran into your neighbors; Fox&#39;s Restaurant had been a local landmark since 1955. All that is gone.</p>
<p>Ironically, I had recently returned from a business trip to Dresden, Germany, which was (famously) fire-bombed and leveled in WWII. They rebuilt. So will we. But it will be a long road to recovery.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>
A version of this article previously appeared in <a href="https://origamiusa.org/thefold/article/careers-origami" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OrigamiUSA&#8217;s <i>The Fold</i> online magazine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you&#8217;ve heard that there are professional origami artists. Yes, there are a few: myself, <a href="http://www.origami.as/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Wu</a>, <a href="http://www.origamido.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael LaFosse</a>, <a href="http://www.origami-artist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Jackson</a>, and <a href="http://www.mabonaorigami.com/en/news/upcoming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sipho Mabona</a> for starters. (And lots of others: if I&#8217;ve left you out, my apologies&mdash;it&#8217;s assuredly not a complete list.) And you&#8217;d like to become one yourself, which is completely understandable because getting someone else to pay you to do something you love, like origami, is just about the best thing imaginable! So how do you get started?
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll answer that…but first, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of caveats and fine print that needs to get laid out. The first one is: I can&#8217;t tell you how to become me&mdash;or Joseph, Michael, Paul, or Sipho. There&#8217;s already one of each of those. Each of today&#8217;s professional origami artists is unique: we have our own artistic approaches, our own skill sets, and our own areas of specialization. There&#8217;s certainly overlap in what we do (i.e., origami figures into it all), but we all have our niches. And if you become a professional artist, you&#8217;ll have to find your niche.
</p>
<p>
The second caveat is that the image is not the reality. The tempting image is that we sit around all day folding whatever we want, and at the end of the day, people deliver bucketfuls of money to our door in exchange for what we&#8217;ve created. The reality is that most of us get paid by clients, and clients usually have very definite ideas of what they want, and those ideas are often not what we might be folding if left to our own devices. If you&#8217;re going to bristle at folding what someone else wants you to fold, then maybe you&#8217;d be better off making your money in some other way and keeping origami an enjoyable pursuit that you can do however you wish. If, though, (like me), you find the novelty of client requests an interesting challenge (most of the time, anyway), then maybe an origami career might be agreeable to you.
</p>
<p>
The third (and final) caveat is, if you&#8217;ve made origami your business, you&#8217;re going to have to spend a lot of effort on the business side of things: preparing and sending bids, invoicing, keeping records for taxes, and perhaps most time-worthy, marketing yourself. No matter how talented an artist you are, if clients don&#8217;t know to bring opportunities to you, the origami-as-business won&#8217;t work out. It&#8217;s true that if one has a reputation in a field, then opportunities tend to come your way; but when you&#8217;re starting out, you need to build that reputation, and nowadays that means exploiting every possible avenue of self-advertisement: website, photo sites, social media, and more.
</p>
<p>
Are you still with me after all those scary caveats? Well, great: now comes the information. I get asked a lot, &#8220;what should I study? And what are some resources?&#8221; And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll address next.
</p>
<p>
But wait: one more caveat. What you study will depend on your niche. If you&#8217;re focusing on engineering, you&#8217;ll study different things than if you&#8217;re focusing on graphic arts and advertising. Because the world is a rapidly changing place (and origami is a rapidly changing field), any specific advice is going to be of limited utility. The opportunities available to you will be different from the ones available to me, and so any advice that is only applicable to the circumstances I faced would likely be not very useful.
</p>
<p>
There is one general piece of advice I can give, which is to follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pasteur</a>&#8216;s advice: &#8220;chance favors the prepared mind.&#8221; If you learn a lot about many fields that <i>might</i> be applicable, you will be better prepared to go into the one that actually turns out to be applicable&mdash;and even better, you&#8217;ll be prepared to follow the new interdisciplinary field that never existed before. Most of the innovation in life happens on the edges, between the defined boundaries of existing fields. A flexible outlook and broad background give you a leg up in pursuing those new fields.
</p>
<p>
(This is, of course, a principle with applicability outside the world of professional origami. But it&#8217;s especially relevant to the fast-changing world of origami.)
</p>
<p>
So where and when do you start? It depends on where you are now.
</p>
<h2>Elementary and Middle School</h2>
<p>
This is the age where a lot of people get their start in origami (it was for me). You&#8217;re a long way from your origami career&mdash;or maybe not: <a href="http://www.budaiorigami.hu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Budai</a> had his first origami book published at age 12. (Now you&#8217;re saying &#8220;oh no, I&#8217;m 14, I haven&#8217;t published a book, and so I must be already over the hill! Don&#8217;t worry: Peter was exceptional. Most of us are much older before we publish.) So what do you study? In most elementary and middle schools, you don&#8217;t get a whole lot of choice in the matter of what happens within school, so my advice is primarily about what happens out of school, which is: have fun with it! If you want to do origami as a career, you&#8217;ll be doing it a long time: and it needs to be fun enough that you&#8217;ll keep folding for a long time. The best motivator for persistence is that the activity be fun. So fold the things you enjoy, don&#8217;t bother with the stuff that bores you, and don&#8217;t worry about what anyone else says about the value, or lack of value, in what you do.
</p>
<p>
(Actually, if people hassle you too much about what you&#8217;re doing, that folding is a waste of time, you can point them to some of the books I list below, or the links on my website, and tell them &#8220;go read this, then come back and talk to me about &#8216;waste of time.'&#8221;)
</p>
<p>
Now, there are a few things you can do to advance your future origami career. The first is, focus on folding cleanly and elegantly. Because you&#8217;ll need to do that as a professional. So when you&#8217;ve succeeded in folding some new figure from a CP that contains 10,000 creases, that&#8217;s great as an accomplishment in itself. But you might also ask yourself, &#8220;is it as clean and neat as it could be?&#8221; And if it&#8217;s not, you might just try folding it one more time, focusing on the craftsmanship, before you move onto the next thing.
</p>
<p>
The other thing you can do to advance your future origami prospects is: don&#8217;t let your schoolwork suffer because origami has pushed it aside. Origami can be&mdash;almost certainly is&mdash;WAY more fun than the regular curriculum. But the better your grades are, the more likely you&#8217;ll end up in control of your own destiny down the road.
</p>
<p>
<i>What books should I get? </i>
</p>
<p>
At this point, there&#8217;s no specialized book to recommend; if you choose books based on what looks fun, you can&#8217;t go wrong. &#8220;Recipe books&#8221;&mdash;books of folding instructions&mdash;are just fine for learning a range of techniques and getting exposure to ideas. If you&#8217;re an intermediate folder looking to take a step up, I&#8217;d recommend <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/product-search?combine=montroll">any of Montroll&#8217;s books</a>, which are not too hard but expose a wide variety of clever folding ideas. To push your folding skills, the various books from <a href="http://www.origamihouse.jp/book/original/house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallery Origami House</a> and <a href="http://Origami-Shop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origami-Shop.com</a> will keep you plenty busy.
</p>
<h2>High School</h2>
<p>
In high school, while there are many required courses, you&#8217;ll likely have some choice in what you take, and so here, you can take an active role in setting yourself up for success in the future of origami. So what should you take? What is the Official Origami Curriculum?
</p>
<p>
Alas, there&#8217;s not a &#8220;core curriculum&#8221; in origami, in the sense of &#8220;you absolutely have to take this class.&#8221; Almost any given class you could live without. But there are a couple of classes that will likely have a beneficial effect down the road.
</p>
<p>
I would highly recommend taking some art classes in which you create art: drawing, sculpture, or other form of art. Yes, none of those classes will teach you origami (the fine arts still tend to get a bit snooty about origami. Their loss.) The things you are seeking to get out of art classes are knowledge and practice of technique: how to look at a subject and create a representation in another medium. What sorts of things are artistically valued. The importance of quality and craftsmanship.
</p>
<p>
Also good would be some sort of digital art, involving 3D modeling, rendering, digital fabrication. This will also help your visualization skills when it comes to creating origami, but also, if you end up working as a designer (industrial design involving folding, graphic arts based on digital media), you&#8217;ll likely make use of similar skills. Now, the pace of digital tool evolution is rapid, so it&#8217;s almost certain that the specific digital skills you learn in high school will be obsolete by the time you get to college and work (I haven&#8217;t programmed in my high-school computer language&mdash;BASIC&mdash;in a really long time). But the general concepts will be useful. A general computer programming course would also help build a conceptual skill set.
</p>
<p>
If you know me, my love of mathematics, and my use of mathematics in my origami design, you might be expecting me to recommend hard-core mathematics classes. And I suppose I do, with some qualifications: it&#8217;s not necessary for everyone, and mathematics is certainly not necessary to design very complex and sophisticated origami. One of the great accomplishments of the origami design revolution of the 1990s and 2000s was the development of purely graphical techniques for design, whereby one can design supercomplex figures doing nothing more sophisticated than drawing boxes, circles, and other shapes. So you don&#8217;t absolutely need fancy math.
</p>
<p>
But, back to Pasteur: chance favors the prepared mind. There is no question that in the vast space of not-yet-realized origami designs, the vast majority can only be attained by use of computational techniques. If you have an inclination toward mathematics, and want to explore the virgin reaches of origami design space, then I will highly suggest you take the relevant advanced mathematics. In particular, I recommend these classes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>	Geometry</li>
<li>	Algebra</li>
<li>	Trigonometry</li>
<li>	Linear Algebra (if it&#8217;s available)</li>
</ul>
<p>
You probably can&#8217;t get all the way through that without some calculus along the way. That&#8217;s fine, too. Linear algebra is not often offered in high school, but if you can find a course (perhaps via a local community college), it&#8217;s pretty useful; it&#8217;s the mathematical language one uses to describe two- and three-dimensional objects.
</p>
<p>
Really, though, I don&#8217;t think you can go wrong with any math course. If I were having a do-over and had the opportunity, I&#8217;d take every math course I could. Even esoteric-sounding fields like Number Theory or Group Theory &mdash;both of which I&#8217;ve learned a little bit of &mdash; have their place and I have found both of them poking up their heads now and then in my origami work.
</p>
<p>
The course I recommend the most strongly, though, is probably not what you&#8217;d expect: every year you should take a course in which you have to write. The name might vary: English Composition, or Literary Criticism. The actual topic doesn&#8217;t even matter all that much. What is important is that you get practice communicating clearly via the written word.
</p>
<p>
And why is that important? It&#8217;s because of the business side of origami. Whether you are selling yourself via your website, or working as an industrial designer or a mechanical engineer, or developing unfolding spacecraft for NASA, you are going to be communicating what you do to others (as I am doing right now). If you want to be able to fold what you want, you need to be in control of your own destiny, and for that to happen, you need to be able to communicate clearly. In the real world, people who can communicate get choice in what they do; people who can&#8217;t communicate end up taking direction from those who can, regardless of their technical skills.
</p>
<p>
<i>What books should I get?</i>
</p>
<p>
As with elementary/middle school recommendations, when it comes to recipe books of folding diagrams, anything that looks fun and pushes your folding ability would be worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
There are also some good origami books that are more than mere collections of instructions, and if you&#8217;re thinking about origami as a career, high school is a good time to start looking beyond just following diagrams.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;d like to learn more about design, <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/origami-design-secrets-second-edition">my own <i>Origami Design Secrets</i></a> is a great place to start.
</p>
<p>
To learn more about the mathematics of origami, <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/project-origami-second-edition-activities-exploring-mathematics">Tom Hull&#8217;s <i>Project Origami</i></a> contains mathematics accessible to high schoolers, as well as some more advanced material that you can save till later. Another good book in this category is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Fold-It-Mathematics-Polyhedra/dp/0521145473/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s <i>How to Fold It</i></a>. Like <i>Project Origami</i>, it contains material suitable for high school as well as more advanced material that will give you a taste of things to come.
</p>
<p>
To see how folding shows up in the real world of industrial design, <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/folding-techniques-designers-sheet-form">Paul Jackson&#8217;s <i>Folding Techniques for Designers</i></a> is a great reference.
</p>
<h2>College</h2>
<p>
The obvious question here is: &#8220;what college offers a major in origami?&#8221; And the answer is: &#8220;none of them do.&#8221; So you&#8217;re going to have to major in something else that&#8217;s relevant, and fit origami into a more conventional major. Remember what I said about innovation happening at the boundaries between well-defined fields? Well, that&#8217;s the situation with professional origami and college. The origami is going fill the space between existing college majors. You just need to find a major (or two) that origami is on the boundary of.
</p>
<p>
So, what are the conventional majors that origami has connections to? There are several potential candidates, and the one, or ones, for you will depend on the specific direction you want to take after you graduate.
</p>
<p>
If your inclination is toward the more artistic side&mdash;graphic arts, industrial design&mdash;then an arts college, such as <a href="http://www.risd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhode Island School of Design</a>, <a href="http://www.cooper.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooper Union</a>, or Pasadena&#8217;s <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art Center College of Design</a> might be the place. Schools like that will give you a well-rounded artistic and design education and there will be ample opportunities to fit origami into the work you are doing there&mdash;and into your eventual artistic career, whether freelance or (more likely) working in a design group.
</p>
<p>
On the more technical side of things, the field of Mechanical Engineering also has many opportunities for folding. Mechanical engineering is all about tangible physical structures, things that move, and fabrication techniques&mdash;all of which couple well to origami. (In fact, there are right now programs funded by the National Science Foundation combining origami with mechanical engineering.) Many of the principles of origami design have analogs in &#8220;MechEng&#8221; (and vice-versa). If you become a mechanical engineer, there will be ample opportunity to bring origami into what you do&mdash;but as a starting engineer post-graduation, what you do will likely be dictated by your manager and your company&#8217;s projects, so ending up as a mechanical engineer whose day job involves origami each and every day is by no means assured.
</p>
<p>
Roughly halfway between Mechanical Engineering and Art lies Architecture, and there, too, we find applications of origami (as well as some amazingly talented origami artists, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Engel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Engel</a> and <a href="http://www.tsg.ne.jp/TT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomohiro Tachi</a>).
</p>
<p>
Getting even more technical, the field of Computer Science has many connections to origami, including a subfield, Computational Geometry, that has great overlap. It&#8217;s no coincidence that Computational Geometry includes the first professor whose officially sanctioned research area included origami (that would be <a href="http://erikdemaine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Erik Demaine</a>, of <a href="http://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT</a>&mdash;prior to Erik, professors had to sneak their origami in through the side door of their research), as well as <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first high-level technical course on the theory of origami</a> (again, taught by Erik at MIT). It seems likely to me that many future innovations in design algorithms and the theory of origami will come from the field of computational geometry, and with a solid grounding in computer science, you will be well equipped to pursue them.
</p>
<p>
Theoretical computer science is really just a subfield of Mathematics, and Mathematics not only takes in the computational aspects of origami: it describes many other properties of origami as well. Mathematics is the study of patterns and relationships, and origami is all about patterns and relationships. While each of the preceding areas focuses on one or another facet of folding, mathematics is, in some sense, the glue that ties it all together.
</p>
<p>
If your origami goal is to investigate the theory of origami, both mathematics and computer science could be appropriate majors, but there are some caveats. Many computer science programs focus on programming, since that&#8217;s what the vast majority of CS majors end up doing in the real world. If you want to take the CS route to origami, you should make sure the school has offerings in theoretical CS and algorithms. Conversely, in the world of professional mathematics research, much of origami mathematics is viewed as &#8220;applied&#8221; and, in some cases, even looked down upon. It might be worth talking to a few professors in the department before you select your college or major.
</p>
<p>
What about other fields: physics, materials science, other fields of engineering? They certainly don&#8217;t preclude a career in origami, and just as certainly can serve as a springboard (my own background is electrical engineering, lasers, and optics). Those NSF research programs I mentioned include professors in many different technical areas: physicists, chemists, biologists, and engineers. They weren&#8217;t trained in origami to begin with (most of them, anyhow); they picked it up and learned what they needed to.
</p>
<p>
And that brings me to graduate school: master&#8217;s degree and Ph.D. Most of what I&#8217;ve said about the college curriculum applies as well to graduate schools&mdash;which may not even be needed. On the artistic side of things, a Bachelor&#8217;s or Master&#8217;s is a perfectly good terminal degree. For more technical areas, a Ph.D. might be very useful. A Ph.D. is essentially training to carry out independent research, and independence is one of the things that might make it possible to work origami into your day-to-day work activity. If you do go on for a Ph.D., the schools that are open to you depend on what your undergraduate major was, and on your grades, senior thesis, and contacts you made during your undergraduate years. When considering a Ph.D. program, the specific department you&#8217;re in doesn&#8217;t matter near as much as the research specialty of your major professor. So, when you&#8217;re considering a postgraduate program, you should look at professors who are working on something that includes (or could possibly include) folding.
</p>
<p>
<i>What books should I get?</i>
</p>
<p>
There are academic books on origami, and you should at least read through a few of them. A good overview of academic folding can be found in the series <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/origami-3-third-international-meeting-origami-science-math-education"><i>Origami3</i></a>, <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/origami-4-fourth-international-meeting-origami-science-math-education"><i>Origami4</i></a>, and <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/origami-5-fifth-international-meeting-origami-science-math-education"><i>Origami5</i></a> (and, coming in 2015, <i>Origami6</i>). The mathematics of origami is covered in <a href="https://origamiusa.org/catalog/products/project-origami-second-edition-activities-exploring-mathematics">Hull&#8217;s <i>Project Origami</i></a>, and a deep look at the computational aspects of folding are to be found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Folding-Algorithms-Linkages-Polyhedra/dp/0521857570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demaine and O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s <i>Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, and Polyhedra</i></a>. However, at this level, books are only a small portion of the available literature. There is much now available in <a href="http://mechanicaldesign.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/issue.aspx?journalid=126&amp;issueid=927703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">field-specific professional journals</a>. The field of academic origami is fast-changing, so rather than suggesting specific journals, I will suggest instead that you do your own literature searches using your university&#8217;s library services (and/or <a href="http://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Scholar</a>), and keep a regular lookout for new papers in your field.
</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>
I started this article to answer the question I am often asked by people of all ages, which is usually some variation of &#8220;how do I become a famous origami person?&#8221; And I hope the thoughts above provide a little assistance. But I think that the world of professional origami is a lot like the world of professional music and other performance fields: 90% of the practitioners are starving artists. Another 9% get steady work and make a living at it; and 1% get to be famous. A lot of the time, the difference between the 9% and the 1% is nothing more than luck, or being in the right place at the right time (and having that &#8220;prepared mind,&#8221; of course). So I would suggest not setting your sights on the 1%, but rather, aim to be one of those who get steady work. To do that, you can make sure your education is contributing; learn the standards of business; strive to produce quality work, whatever it is; and be ready when the 1% chance comes along. Even if it never comes, you will have had a great time.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Computational Origamists</h2>
<p>Modern research in origami modeling and algorithms almost certainly requires some level of programming, which, with the growth in interest in computational origami, means there are tens, if not hundreds of people who have done some level of programming. These are a few of the more prominent researchers who have developed and posted publicly available tools (see above for specifics).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://erikdemaine.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erik Demaine (MIT)</a><br />
Erik Demaine is one of the leading computation origamists in the world; he and his co-authors have solved numerous computational origami problems, demonstrating both complexity classes and algorithms both existence-proving and efficient.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glaucio Paulino (Georgia Tech)</a><br />
Professor Paulino&#8217;s research focuses on computational mechanics and spans development of methodologies to characterize deformation and fracture behavior of existing and emerging materials and structural systems, topology optimization for large-scale and multiscale/multiphysics problems, and origami.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edwin Peraza-Hernandez (University of California Irvine)</a><br />
Professor Peraza Herandez&#8217;s research explores the modeling, analysis, and design aspects of morphing structures, especially those inspired by origami and tensegrity.</li>
<li><a href="http://mitani.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jun Mitani (University of Tsukuba)</a><br />
Professor Mitani has developed the theory and tools of many origami structures; you can see examples of them and his papers on his website.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tsg.ne.jp/TT/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomohiro Tachi (University of Tokyo)</a><br />
Tomohiro Tachi has developed a number of origami computational tools and has developed fundamental theory in the area of rigid folding and the notoriously difficult field of thick origami.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://origamimagiro.github.io/checkerboards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checkerboards</a> — a collection my Jason Ku of the many ways to fold two-colored checkerboards of various sizes, with links to mathematical analyses and .fold format files for several of them.</li>

<p>I am regularly asked if I would create video instructions for my origami designs. Sorry, I&#8217;m not currently set up to make such videos myself. However, if you&#8217;re a videographer and would like to hire me to demonstrate and/or do hand-modeling of folding (something I&#8217;ve done several times for commercial clients), please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> and tell me what you have in mind.</p>
<p>There are quite a few talented origami instructional videographers out there already, whose work you can find on <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and other video sites, and some of them have made videos of my work. I do recommend <a href="http://happyfolding.com" target="_blank">Sara Adams&#8217;s channel</a> for good, high-quality origami instructional videos (of many people&#8217;s work, not just mine).</p>
<p><!-- To come: links to curated YouTube videos. --></p>
<p>If you are interested in creating video instructional videos of my work, <a href="/contact/">please contact me</a> and tell me which work you are interested in. To make it clear which figure you&#8217;re talking about, please either provide a web link to its page on my site or specify which book it&#8217;s in (you can do both, of course).</p>
<p>In general, for origami that isn&#8217;t a traditional design (which is most of today&#8217;s origami), one must obtain permission from the artist to post origami videos; <a href="/copyright/">see here for details</a>. Even aside from copyright law (and its various disputes), it is basic respect and courtesy to the artist to obtain permission before distributing their work in any form and include appropriate attribution.</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://langorigami.com/article/polypolyhedra/"><![CDATA[<p><!-- Polypolyhedra --></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 1999, I became interested in a family of origami modulars composed of interwoven polygonal frames and/or polyhedral skeletons, the most famous of which was devised by Tom Hull, which he titled <em>Five Intersecting Tetrahedra</em>, now commonly known by its abbreviation, <em>FIT</em>. (<a href="http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/fit.html" target="_blank">See here for a description</a>.) The underlying polyhedron&mdash;a compound of five tetrahedra &mdash; has been known for hundreds of years, but Tom&#8217;s implementation as an origami skeleton had an uncanny beauty that made it an instant classic of the origami repertoire.</p>
<p>Naturally, of course, I wished I&#8217;d thought of it. But it also got me to wondering if there were any other origami modulars that were similar. The first thing to do is to define a bit more precisely what one means by &#8220;similar&#8221;. I decided that the salient features of FIT that I wanted to replicate were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure was composed of units that followed the edges of geometric polyhedra;</li>
<li>The structure must be composed of a single type of origami unit;</li>
<li>The structure must contain multiple polyhedra;</li>
<li>The multiple polyhedra must be linked together;</li>
<li>The structure must hold together by folded locks.
</ul>
<p>I resolved to find all such structure that satisfied these criteria. Because these structures were compounds of polyhedra, I coined the name <em>polypolyhedra</em> to describe them.</p>
<p>Before I could construct origami versions of any polypolyhedra, I first needed to identify the underlying abstract geometric shapes: the underlying polyhedra. Now, the field of polyhedra is vast. Innumerable classes, families, and variations of polyhedra and their derivatives have been identified and seemed that these things I called polypolyhedra were likely already to be found within the mathematical literature. For one example, the compound of five intersecting tetrahedra &mdash; the basis of Hull&#8217;s FIT &mdash; is one of the 59 known stellations of the icosahedron enumerated by H. S. M. Coxeter. I eventually learned that many years ago a Bell Labs mathematician, Alan Holden, had examined a wide range of linked skeletal structures, which he dubbed <em>polylinks</em>, and described them in his book, <em>Orderly Tangles</em>). Nevertheless, I found no complete enumeration of what was possible. So, I set out to enumerate them all.</p>
<p>I realized that symmetry played a key role in identifying what shapes were possible, and eventually found that it was possible to enumerate all possible interwoven shapes foldable from a single type of unit by examining the possible relevant symmetry groups and sorting through all the possible combinations of symmetry groups and orbits using <em>Mathematica</em>. Eventually, I was able to show that there are exactly 54 topologically distinct varieties of polypolyhedra, not including mirror images (most are enantiomorphic). Quite a few of them have a geometric structure suitable for rendition in origami, and once I&#8217;d found the geometric structures, I developed origami folding sequences for several of them (including the ones on this page).</p>
<p>Once I&#8217;d folded a particular polypolyhedron in origami, there came the question: what to call it? Tom named his design for the underlying geometric solid: &#8220;Five Intersecting Tetrahedra.&#8221; But a purely geometric description of some of these new structures could be a mouthful: &#8220;Five Intersecting Tetrahedrally Distorted Skew Rhombic Hexahedra&#8221;, for example. So I decided that instead of a descriptive name, I&#8217;d just give them short, easily-memorable names, and began naming them after Himalayan peaks: <em>Gasherbrum</em>, <em>Annapurna</em>, and <em>Makalu</em>, for starters. The most interesting I dubbed <em>Chomolungma</em>, which is one of the local names for Mount Everest, and when I built one with the same number of pieces as <em>Chomolungma</em> but that was far harder to assemble, what else could I call it but <em>K2</em>?</p>

  </div>
<div class="article-figure-caption">
    Left: Folded model of the 6x1x5 polypolyhedron named <em>Makalu</em>.<br />
    Right: Folded model of the 20x1x3 polypolyhedron named <em>K2</em>.
  </div>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve now designed several of these structures in origami; some you&#8217;ll find in the galleries, some have been published in various origami society publications. There are <strike>54</strike> &mdash;wait, I mean <strike>55</strike> &mdash; wait, I mean ( 55 + infty ) distinct varieties, however, so the vast majority await rendition in origami. (Why the changing numbers? See below.) I&#8217;ve also written several articles that describe the mathematics of polypolyhedra and how I analyzed them, and you can download these below.</p>
<h2>First Cook</h2>
<p>I mentioned above that the number of polypolyhedra has changed&mdash;twice! The first happened in 2014, when Aaron Pfitzenmeyer, to whom I had given my enumeration code, came to me and said, &#8220;I think you missed one.&#8221; And indeed I had. It turned out that when I was counting the topologically distinct versions, I had done so by counting the distinct lobes in a plot of inter-stick-distance versus scaling parameter in Mathematica plots. But the adaptive scaling in 2001-era Mathematica had smoothed over a tiny sliver of a lobe in the plot for 10x3x4 (ten rhombic trihedral dipyramids). In later versions of Mathematica, the lobe was picked up; and Aaron spotted it.</p>
<div class="article-figure">
<div class="article-figure-img">
    <img decoding="async" class="img-5" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/polypolyhedra_2001_plot.jpg" /><br />
    <img decoding="async" class="img-7" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/polypolyhedra_2014_plot.jpg" />
  </div>
<div class="article-figure-caption">
    Left: The inter-stick distance plot by 2001-vintage Mathematica.<br />
    Right: the 2014-era version of the equivalent plot. Note the small spike next to the tallest lobe.
  </div>
</div>
<p>So there is, in fact, a 55th polypolyhedron, which I would like to name &#8220;Pfitzenmeyer&#8221; in honor of its discoverer. (Who has gone on to construct and build amazing 2-uniform and higher polypolyhedra far more complex than anything in my collection; <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/42647582@N07/" target="_blank">see here</a>.)</p>
<h2>Second Cook</h2>
<p>But it&#8217;s even worse! Also in 2014, Tom Hull and sarah-marie belcastro pointed out that I&#8217;d erroneously overlooked the dihedral group (in this case, because my computer-aided search routine had erroroneously discarded them as being unlinked). In this case, there was an example of a dihedral polypolyhedron for each even rotational order. So, as I like to say, it was a small error in my counting; I was only off by infinity. You can read about Tom and sarah-marie&#8217;s analysis, and some lovely related coloring problems, in their article, &#8220;Symmetric Colorings of Polypolyhedra&#8221;, which appears in the book <a href="https://langorigami.com/publication/origami6-part-i/">Origami<sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Origami Artists</h2>
<p>There is an ever-growing number of origami artists and many of them have established a presence on the web. I couldn&#8217;t possibly give an exhaustive list (although there are a few such lists out there), but the following links connect to the work of a few artists whose compositions I particularly admire.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.origamido.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael LaFosse</a></strong><br />
Michael LaFosse&#8217;s representational origami is stunning and beautiful; in my view, his work comes closer than anyone to the feeling and life of the legendary Japanese master Yoshizawa. In addition, he is a master papermaker, and origami artists the world around use his handmade &#8220;Origamido&#8221; paper in their own work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Éric_Joisel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Joisel</a></strong><br />
The late Eric Joisel&#8217;s amazing work sometimes doesn&#8217;t even seem possible to be origami. He was a master of incorporating texture into his work; in addition, he remains one of the few origami artists to have mastered the human figure. His masks have inspired others to pursue similar concepts, but Eric&#8217;s own work is distinctly unique and the full-human figures he developed in the last several years of his life were mind-boggling in their beauty.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.folders.jp/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Satoshi Kamiya</a></strong><br />
This astonishing young prodigy from Japan designs what are probably the most complex origami figures in the world, and yet manages to imbue them with grace, delicacy, and life.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://origami.gr.jp/~hojyo/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Takashi Hojyo</a></strong><br />
Like Joisel, a master of the human figure, albeit in an entirely different way. Hojyo creates figures especially rich in texture and three-dimensionality, utilizing pleats and multiple layers of paper to build depth in his subjects.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.le-crimp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Floderer</a></strong><br />
Vincent has developed an entirely new style of folding, based on controlled crumpling, that stretches the very definition of origami. But it is indeed origami; one sheet, formed only by folding, and the result includes some of the most remarkable and unexepectedly organic forms in the art.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://web.mit.edu/chosetec/www/origami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Chan</a></strong><br />
Brian is one of the rising stars of American origami design whose work, more than any other folder, inspires in me the emotion of &#8220;gee, I wish I&#8217;d done that!&#8221; Like Kamiya, he combine technical brilliance in the design with delicacy and grace in the execution.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Neal-Elias-British-Society/dp/1546512276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neal Elias</a></strong><br />
The late Neal Elias was one of the pioneers of modern origami, performing the first in-depth exploration of the design family now known as &#8220;box pleating&#8221;, and creator of hundreds of elegance and beautiful designs through the 1960s and 1970s. This tribute site shows a sampling of his work.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.fishgoth.com/ebay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay &#8220;eBooks&#8221;</a></strong><br />
While eBay provides a useful marketplace for sales of many sorts, it unfortunately enables a great deal of piracy through its sales of so-called &#8220;eBooks&#8221; &#8212; which regularly include pirated origami instructions. (In fact, I have yet to see a non-pirated origami &#8220;eBook&#8221; on eBay.)</li>

In the design of optical systems that incorporate multiple reflections of converging and diverging beams, tedious graphic layout procedures are followed to assure that mirror dimensions are correct and that structural elements do not interfere with the ray bundles. A change in dimension, location, or angle of any one of the system elements requires a complete redrawing of the system, making this a time-consuming and costly process.</blockquote >

<img decoding="async" class="img-8" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/optigami_example.jpg" width="400" alt="Optigami example" title="Optigami example" />
  </div>
<div class="article-figure-caption">
    An example of a simple optigami simulation.
  </div>
</div>
<p>Thus began Jon Myer, a scientist at the Hughes Research Laboratories, in describing a technique for optical layout using origami. Nowadays, the physical layout of mirrors and lenses is done automatically by computer programs that analyze the optics by ray-tracing through the system of lenses and mirrors. In an earlier time, this analysis was carried out by hand. In complex optical systems, rays of light are bent, refracted, focused, and folded through contorted pathways, and ensuring that no bundle of light is inadvertently clipped off can be a nontrivial feat. In the days before personal computers were on every desktop, such ray-tracing was an elaborate paper-and-pencil exercise.</p>
<p>Myer recognized that the origami reverse fold, applied to a narrow triangle of paper, accurately reproduced several important features of optical ray-tracing. By folding a narrow triangle of paper and reverse-folding it at each reflection, one could simulate the contortions of the beam of light as it traversed the system with a concrete object for visualization. As a simulation tool, the reverse fold embodies several features that accurate simulate the tracing of rays of light:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reversal of color that accompanies a reverse-fold simulates image reversal that occurs at each reflection off of a mirror;</li>
<li>The angle of the reverse fold automatically gives the proper angle for orienting a mirror at the point of reflection;</li>
<li>By cutting and &#8220;feathering&#8221; the edges of the triangle, not only can focusing be simulated, but the rough curvature of the focusing mirror is also obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further advantage of the optigami technique is that one can alter the angles and locations of mirrors without altering the total optical path length—an advantage in many optical design problems.</p>
<p>Although simple and elegant, optigami was ultimately superseded by the rapid growth and availability of personal computers and computerized ray-tracing programs. Nowadays, for less than $1000, a computerized ray-tracer can simulate reflections refractions, and vignetting from flat and curved mirrors with considerably greater speed and accuracy than origami approximations. Nevertheless, as an aid to visualization, or for quick-and-dirty calculations — such as the proverbial <q>back-of-the-napkin</q> sketch — optigami still has its place in the optical designer&#8217;s arsenal of tools.</p>
<p>An example of the latter usage may be found in a type of laser described by <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&#038;Sect2=HITOFF&#038;d=PALL&#038;p=1&#038;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&#038;r=1&#038;f=G&#038;l=50&#038;s1=6542529.WKU.&#038;OS=PN/6542529&#038;RS=PN/6542529" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Patent 6,542,529</a>, titled, appropriately enough, a <q>folded-cavity laser.</q> This family of lasers was developed by Swedish engineer Mats Hagberg and myself, working at laser company SDL, Inc. The folded-cavity laser addresses a fundamental problem in a type of laser called an <q>index-guided broad area semiconductor laser</q> — a laser microchip used in thermal printing and green laser pointers, among other places. The beam coming out of these lasers tends to spread across a broad range of angles. Mats showed that by taking a conventional laser and effectively folding the cavity in two places, it was possible to collapse the broad output beam down to a much narrower, much brighter beam, without losing efficiency.</p>

</ul>
<p>For another interesting take on the &#8220;optigami&#8221; concept, I recently learned of a project with that very name! Bart Millikan is an inventor who has developed folded reflectors for collimation and illumination, which he calls &#8220;optigami&#8221; on his website, optigami-design.com (no longer active, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110202061511/http://optigami-design.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archived version here</a>). Bart has also very kindly provided <a href="https://langorigami.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/optigami_pattern.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this downloadable pattern</a> for a collimating reflector, if you want to give it a try.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;d like to try designing your own foldable reflector and have the program <a href="http://www.wolfram.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mathematica</a>, I&#8217;ve written a <a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/OrigamiFlangedPots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design-your-own rotationally symmetric folded figure</a> as a Mathematica Demonstration project; feel free to give it a whirl!</p>
