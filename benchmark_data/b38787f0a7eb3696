&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects I really like about KNX is that it is a brand-agnostic protocol, which makes it very easy to find any kind of object compatible with it.
Another aspect that KNX has, different from many other options, is that it is it bus based.
Being bus-based is a huge pain when you have to install it, but once you have done it, the experience is way better, since there is no perceptible delay, no risk of interference, etc., making the day-to-day experience indistinguishable from a traditionally cabled system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Red Hat EX374 exam</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2025/11/13/red-hat-ex374-exam</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2025_11_13_red_hat_ex374_exam.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2025/11/13/red-hat-ex374-exam</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I sat the Red Hat EX374 exam to renew my Red Hat Certified Specialist in Developing Automation with Ansible Automation Platform certification.
As I’m already a Red Hat Certified Architect and have passed this same exam a couple of years ago, I wasn’t too worried about it.
Still, it is always interesting to see how exams evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I registered for the exam, I quickly checked the Objectives and remembered that it covered both Ansible core content (playbooks, modules, roles) and a lot of Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) capabilities, such as controllers, collections, and execution environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Leverage Event Driven Ansible to reduce your automation reaction time</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2025_11_05_gs_uk_eda</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2025_11_05_gs_uk_eda</guid><description/></item><item><title>Simplifying container orchestration with Ansible and Podman</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2025_11_04_gs_uk_podman</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2025_11_04_gs_uk_podman</guid><description/></item><item><title>bootc 101: dalla container image alla tua distro personale</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2025_10_25_bootc</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2025_10_25_bootc</guid><description/></item><item><title>AWS SSA-C03 exam</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2025/10/16/aws-ssa-c03-exam</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2025_10_16_aws_ssa_c03_exam.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2025/10/16/aws-ssa-c03-exam</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Three years passed from the &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2022/10/30/aws-ssa-c03-exam/"&gt;last AWS exam&lt;/a&gt; I took, and my AWS certifications were due for renewal.
The first thing I checked was the exam code, which I had taken three years ago.
It turns out that last time I took the &lt;code&gt;SAA-C03&lt;/code&gt;, and this time I would also have taken the same exam.
This time around, I considered doing the &lt;code&gt;SAP-C02&lt;/code&gt; instead, but, given the very limited time, I decided on the &lt;code&gt;SAA-C03&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Moving out of AWS</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2025/09/18/moving-out-of-aws</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2025_09_18_moving_out_of_aws.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2025/09/18/moving-out-of-aws</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For years, I hosted this blog and several other services on AWS.
AWS is powerful, but it is also expensive and deeply entropic.
It often feels like every problem on AWS has three different services as possible solutions.
Each service has its own setup, and keeping track of everything just gets harder over time.
For personal infrastructure, the financial and cognitive cost simply stopped being worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to close my AWS account and move everything somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Red Hat EX457 exam</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2025/08/31/red-hat-ex457-exam</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2025_08_31_red_hat_ex457_exam.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2025/08/31/red-hat-ex457-exam</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I renewed my &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex457-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-ansible-network-automation-exam"&gt;Red Hat Certified Specialist in Ansible Network Automation (EX457)&lt;/a&gt; certification.
As I&amp;rsquo;m already a Red Hat Certified Architect and have passed this same exam a couple of years ago, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too worried about it.
Still, it is always interesting to see how exams evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I did not remember the kind of content that was there last time, I read the objectives page and assumed it would have been more on the networking side.
But, in reality, the exam leaned much more toward Ansible playbooks, modules, and automation patterns than network-specific plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On your providers business models</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2025/06/30/on-your-providers-business-models</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2025_06_30_on_your_providers_business_models.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2025/06/30/on-your-providers-business-models</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When buying a service, you&amp;rsquo;re not just buying what&amp;rsquo;s on the label.

This aspect is now becoming even more relevant, considering that many times, when buying a product, you are also buying a service with it since there are more and more hybrid products.&lt;/p&gt;

After evaluating a few alternatives, Scaleway&amp;rsquo;s Dedibox lineup caught my attention: it is a European company with good hardware and decent pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as with every good solution, it is not perfect.
Scaleway does not provide Fedora as an OS option for their Dedibox machines.
They offer a decent selection, including Rocky Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu — but no Fedora.
Now, if you know me, you know that Fedora is not just my distro of choice — it&amp;rsquo;s the one I trust for both personal and professional projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How does Ansible Automation help in automating mainframe operations?</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2025_03_04_techxchange_z_ansible</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2025_03_04_techxchange_z_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Leverage Event-Driven Ansible to reduce your automation reaction time</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2025_02_04_cfgmgmtcamp_ansible_eda</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2025_02_04_cfgmgmtcamp_ansible_eda</guid><description/></item><item><title>Simplifying container orchestration with Ansible and Podman</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2025_02_03_cfgmgmtcamp_ansible_podman</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2025_02_03_cfgmgmtcamp_ansible_podman</guid><description/></item><item><title>Upcoming Events: CentOS Connect, FOSDEM, and CfgMgmtCamp</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2025/01/31/upcoming-events-centos-connect-fosdem-and-cfgmgmtcamp</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2025_01_31_upcoming_events_centos_connect_fosdem_and_cfgmgmtcamp.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2025/01/31/upcoming-events-centos-connect-fosdem-and-cfgmgmtcamp</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The next few days are shaping up to be packed with open-source goodness!

Although the event run yesterday and today, I&amp;rsquo;ll only be able to attend today.
CentOS Connect is a small but incredibly valuable event where the wider CentOS community (Fedora, CentOS, and all the Enterprise Linux distros) meets to discuss the space&amp;rsquo;s present and future.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity to meet contributors, learn about upcoming changes, and exchange ideas with people who shape the CentOS ecosystem.
I really like this event because its atmosphere is similar to Flock: very casual and more like a friends&amp;rsquo; gathering than a conference.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A bad year for open source databases</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2024/12/31/a-bad-year-for-open-source-databases</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2024_12_31_a_bad_year_for_open_source_databases.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2024/12/31/a-bad-year-for-open-source-databases</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Although the definitions of Open Source are related to specific software characteristics (i.e., the license), the reality is much more complex.
Open-source is way more related to a social contract that the software&amp;rsquo;s creator and its users morally sign than the definition might lead you to believe.
This social contract&amp;rsquo;s key aspect concerns the software&amp;rsquo;s current license and the licenses of future versions.
This is because although users of open-source software usually do not pay to use it, they incur high costs to do so.
Examples of those costs are training costs and potential costs to replace a certain technology should it become unavailable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduzione all'automation con Red Hat Ansible</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_12_16_techxchange_power_ansible</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_12_16_techxchange_power_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Where does your Ansible code come from?</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_12_04_opensourceexperience_ansible_supply_chain</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_12_04_opensourceexperience_ansible_supply_chain</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hyperscalers are not serious about Service Level Agreements (SLA)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2024/11/30/hyperscalers-are-not-serious-about-service-level-agreements-sla</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2024_11_30_hyperscalers_are_not_serious_about_service_level_agreement_sla.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2024/11/30/hyperscalers-are-not-serious-about-service-level-agreements-sla</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I often talk with people about Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in public cloud contexts, and I discover that their idea of what those SLAs are is often distorted.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple of months ago, I changed the default systemd service unit.
More specifically, this is the change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the change is only a few characters, this change allows for a much more flexible use of Nebula.
Before this change, the configuration could only be placed in the &lt;code&gt;config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.
After this change, all YAML files in the folders will be read, merged, and used as configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dal cloud al self-hosting</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_10_26_self_hosting</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_10_26_self_hosting</guid><description/></item><item><title>La strada verso l'immutabilità di sistemi Linux</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_10_26_immutable_linux</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_10_26_immutable_linux</guid><description/></item><item><title>Migliora la gestione dei container con Event-Driven Ansible</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_10_10_contaiener_day_ansible_eda</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_10_10_contaiener_day_ansible_eda</guid><description/></item><item><title>On being the cheapest cloud</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2024/09/30/on-being-the-cheapest-cloud</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2024_09_30_on_being_the_cheapest_cloud.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2024/09/30/on-being-the-cheapest-cloud</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I heard a pitch from a public cloud company.
Among other characteristics, a key aspect they stressed is that they are the cheapest cloud.
This aspect struck me.
Not because I believe it is or is not, but because I&amp;rsquo;ve heard many companies pitch themselves as the cheapest cloud over the years.
I asked the CTO if they were foreseeing consistent and planned cuts in the pricing every year or so.
The CTO&amp;rsquo;s answer was very sensible but negative on the specific point.
Later the same day, I was thinking more about my interaction with that CTO, and it became clear to me why pitching to be the cheapest cloud is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduzione all'automation con Red Hat Ansible</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_09_25_techxchange_power_ansible</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_09_25_techxchange_power_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Leverage Event Driven Ansible to reduce your automation reaction time</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_09_10_civo_ansible_eda</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_09_10_civo_ansible_eda</guid><description/></item><item><title>On Out of Office emails</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2024/08/26/on-out-of-office-emails</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2024_08_26_on_out_of_office_emails.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2024/08/26/on-out-of-office-emails</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This summer, I found myself multiple times reading out-of-office emails.

Since the exam is still available, I decided to take it again to renew my Red Hat Certified Specialist in Services Management and Automation certification and, therefore, extend my Red Hat Certified Architect certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, I had the impression that the exam had changed quite a bit from the last time I took it.
While the previous time the exam reminded me mostly of an Ansible certification, this time it reminded me way more of the old RHCE exam (the EX300).
The bulk of the exam was about configuring the various services, while in the previous version, there was a lot more focus on the Ansible part, which is more like the EX294.
It is also true that EX300 was phasing out at the time, but it was still an exam many people had, while EX294 was fairly new.
However, as I suggested the previous time, it is still crucial to be able to perform all configurations manually and with Ansible because you can not know what you will be tasked to perform manually and what you will be tasked to perform using Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Derisk the choice of vendors and projects by understanding IT companies' business models</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_06_13_devconf_business_models</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_06_13_devconf_business_models</guid><description/></item><item><title>IBM AIX and Linux on IBM Power - AMA!

Personally, I think one of the most critical yet overlooked ones - both in personal and corporate settings - is backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had to back up a folder containing the state of a service running on a Fedora machine.
As often happens, an interesting aspect of this service is that the backups are consistent and, therefore, restorable only if the service is stopped while the configuration folder is backed up.
Due to the design of this host, I wanted to use Systemd as the backup driver and keep it as simple and obvious as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Forward all your traffic with RedSocks</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2024/04/30/forward-all-your-traffic-with-redsocks</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2024_04_30_forward_all_your_traffic_with_redsocks.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2024/04/30/forward-all-your-traffic-with-redsocks</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;VPNs can be used in different ways based on the desired objective.

Another common use for VPNs is to ensure the confidentiality of data transferred between a remote system and a safe site.
In this case, we might want to ensure that all traffic from the remote system reaches the safe site via the VPN.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Modernize mainframes operations with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_25_gse_ansible</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_25_gse_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Where does your Ansible code come from?</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_24_gse_ansible_supply_chain</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_24_gse_ansible_supply_chain</guid><description/></item><item><title>Modernize mainframes workloads with Red Hat OpenShift Platform</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_23_gse_openshift</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_23_gse_openshift</guid><description/></item><item><title>Leverage Event Driven Ansible to reduce your automation reaction time</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_15_fossnorth_ansible_eda</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_15_fossnorth_ansible_eda</guid><description/></item><item><title>How does Ansible Automation help in automating mainframe operations?</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_10_techxchange_z_ansible</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2024_04_10_techxchange_z_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Use Dante to proxy web traffic</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2024/03/31/use-dante-to-proxy-web-traffic</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2024_03_31_use_dante_to_proxy_web_traffic.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2024/03/31/use-dante-to-proxy-web-traffic</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2022/11/28/use-ssh-to-proxy-web-traffic/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about using SSH to proxy traffic within a Nebula network context.

The problem, though, is that I need to set up the connection every time and use my SSH credentials, so it becomes difficult to have it always on.
A different SOCKS proxy software needs to be used to achieve the same result without SSH.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Please stop using VPN services for privacy!</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2024/03/29/please-stop-using-vpn-services-for-privacy</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2024_03_29_please_stop_using_vpn_services_for_privacy.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2024/03/29/please-stop-using-vpn-services-for-privacy</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, VPN companies have advertised their VPNs as a necessary tool for all people who want to preserve their privacy.
For the same amount of time, I tried to explain to the people that this view made no sense if not for those company&amp;rsquo;s sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onavo"&gt;Onavo&lt;/a&gt;, a Meta subsidiary, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190201133510/https://www.onavo.com/"&gt;used to advertise&lt;/a&gt; its services, highlighting that, among other advantages, using their product &amp;ldquo;protects your personal info&amp;rdquo;.

There are many reasons for this, one of which is that, in this way, the automation becomes the documentation for the system itself.
Another reason that drives me to automate everything is my preference for clean systems.
Another consequence of this preference I have is that in the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved many systems to a Fedora &lt;code&gt;rpm-ostree&lt;/code&gt; flavor (eg: Fedora CoreOS, Fedora IoT, Fedora Atomic) with the various services running in containers managed directly by &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;podman&lt;/code&gt;.
I prefer to create container images via CI/CD processes for the same reasons.
Since I use Quay.io a lot, I usually leverage its capability to hook into git repos and rebuild images based on git tags or git commits.
Recently, I needed a multi-arch image, and I discovered that the usual process does not support multi-arch images.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ansible vs Puppet.

Before the migration, everything worked properly since all the processes were running natively on the machine with the same user.

I started to look for possible exam dates at the beginning of June since it is possible to renew Google Cloud exams only from the 60th day before the expiration to the 30th day after the expiration date.
Since the system informed me that I was outside the 60-day window, I assumed I had to wait until 60 days before the expiration to book the exam.
So I waited.
The day arrived and passed, and still, I was not able to book my exams.
After a few tickets opened to both Google and Kryterion, they informed me that they unblocked my Google Professional Cloud Architect exam, while for the Google Associate Cloud Engineer, more time to unblock it was needed.
I, therefore, took the Google Professional Cloud Architect exam.
Once that one was renewed, I noticed that Google silently and retroactively increased the validity of Google Associate Cloud Engineer certifications from 2 to 3 years, so I will be able to renew that one next year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Practical Ansible - Second Edition</title><link>https://fale.io/publication/practical_ansible_2_second_edition</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/publication/practical_ansible_2_second_edition.jpg"/><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/publication/practical_ansible_2_second_edition</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible empowers you to automate a myriad of tasks, including software provisioning, configuration management, infrastructure deployment, and application rollouts. It can be used as a deployment tool as well as an orchestration tool. While Ansible provides simple yet powerful features to automate multi-layer environments using agentless communication, it can also solve other critical IT challenges, such as ensuring continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) with zero downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll work with the latest release of Ansible and learn how to solve complex issues quickly with the help of task-oriented scenarios. You&amp;rsquo;ll start by installing and configuring Ansible on Linux and macOS to automate monotonous and repetitive IT tasks and learn concepts such as playbooks, inventories, and roles. As you progress, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain insight into the YAML syntax and learn how to port between Ansible versions. Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand how Ansible enables you to orchestrate multi-layer environments such as networks, containers, and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Modernize IBM Z with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_21_z_ansible</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_21_z_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>How does Ansible Automation help in automating mainframe operations?</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_19_z_ansible</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_19_z_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Use per-host SSH key pairs on AWX and Ansible Automation Controller</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2023/09/18/use-per-host-ssh-key-pairs-on-awx-and-ansible-automation-controller</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2023_09_18_use_per_host_ssh_key_pairs_on_awx_and_ansible_automation_controller.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2023/09/18/use-per-host-ssh-key-pairs-on-awx-and-ansible-automation-controller</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects that I have always loved about Ansible is that it integrates very nicely with the rest of the system where it is running.
For example, you can easily configure all the SSH configurations directly by changing the &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; file.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen multiple cases where the SSH configuration file needs to be tweaked.
A case that comes up occasionally is an environment configured in a way that requires Ansible to use a different SSH key for each machine it manages.
I&amp;rsquo;m aware that this is not an ideal setup since it is not increasing the security as much as the person who came up with such a rule was expecting.
Still, it is a requirement that some companies have for various historical reasons and, usually, it is impossible or impractical to challenge.
However, the same process applies to any other SSH connection tweaking that can be performed in the SSH configuration file, such as proxies, ciphers, host checks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On-premise data centers do not need to be legacy</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_14_sreday_datacenter</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_14_sreday_datacenter</guid><description/></item><item><title>On-premise data centers do not need to be legacy</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_06_devopsdays_datacenter</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_09_06_devopsdays_datacenter</guid><description/></item><item><title>Red Hat Certified Specialist in Managing Automation with Ansible Automation Platform</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2023/08/31/red-hat-certified-specialist-in-managing-automation-with-ansible-automation-platform</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2023_08_31_red_hat_certified_specialist_in_managing_automation_with_ansible_automation_platform.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2023/08/31/red-hat-certified-specialist-in-managing-automation-with-ansible-automation-platform</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I passed the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex467-red-hat-certified-specialist-managing-automation-ansible-automation-platform-exam"&gt;Red Hat EX467 exam&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed me to become Red Hat Certified Specialist in Managing Automation with Ansible Automation Platform.
As of today, this is the newest Red Hat exam on Ansible.
You can notice this from the version of Ansible Automated Platform that this exam uses: 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aspect that is already clear by looking at the objective is that this exam is completely complementary to the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex294-red-hat-certified-engineer-rhce-exam-red-hat-enterprise-linux-9"&gt;EX294 exam&lt;/a&gt;.

Given the characteristics I was looking for, there were not many options; in the end, I opted for the ROCKPro64 by Pine64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I received the SBC, I immediately tried to put Fedora on it.
The process proved slightly more complex than I was expecting since I assumed that U-Boot (or some other boot loader) was already present on the board.
Turns out, it is not!
So, the first step became installing U-Boot.
An aspect I really like about the ROCKPro64 is that it has 128Mb of Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Flash memory.
I appreciate this fact because it allows me to install U-Boot there and then a standard OS on another storage device.
Speaking of other storage devices, the ROCKPro64 features both an optional eMMC and the mSD Card slot.
The process turned out more complex than I initially thought since my goal was to use Fedora on the eMMC, but I forgot to get the eMMC USB adapter, so I had to leverage the mSD Card as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>EU EDPB vs. Irish DPC vs. Meta Platforms</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2023/05/24/eu-edpb-vs-irish-dpc-vs-meta-platforms</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2023_05_24_eu_edpb_vs_irish_dpc_vs_meta_platforms.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2023/05/24/eu-edpb-vs-irish-dpc-vs-meta-platforms</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has evaluated the legality of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s (now Meta Platforms) data transfer for over 10 years.

Podman was also providing &lt;code&gt;podman generate systemd&lt;/code&gt; to easily create such Systemd file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has now changed.
From version 4.4 of Podman, in addition to the mentioned method, it is possible to use &lt;a href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html"&gt;Quadlet&lt;/a&gt; to simplify the execution of containers from Systemd.&lt;/p&gt;

Although, it does not mean that everything is seamless when you are using them.
I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered this the hard way!
Below are my findings and the process I followed to make the GitHub Action pipeline work properly with containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with the addition of a new tool in the pipeline, which was not installable on Ubuntu (the GitHub Actions default operating system), due to a packaging issue.
Therefore, I decided to use a Fedora container since I was sure that our toolchain was present and well-maintained in Fedora.
After adding the container definition and changing the toolchain installation command from &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt;, the pipeline seemed to be working properly.
After a few days, it was noticed that the pipeline did not fail but was not working.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fedora Sericea and Sway Spin beta</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2023/03/24/fedora-sericea-and-sway-spin-beta</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2023_03_24_fedora_sericea_and_sway_spin_beta.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2023/03/24/fedora-sericea-and-sway-spin-beta</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Fedora Project released Fedora 38 beta images.

&lt;p&gt;This is a critical point in the release of those Fedora artifacts based on Sway since it is the first time it has been possible to test them for the wider public.
Although the Fedora Project has been creating Sway artifacts for a couple of months, those were based on Rawhide, which is &amp;ldquo;a not always stable&amp;rdquo; version of Fedora, since it tracks far in the future (4-10 months) versions of Fedora.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes supporta diverse architetture.

I was expecting those ports to be closed, and I got surprised when &lt;em&gt;netcat&lt;/em&gt; claimed to be able to connect to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Modernize mainframes operations with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_08_gse_ansible</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_08_gse_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Modernize mainframes workloads with Red Hat OpenShift Platform</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_07_gse_openshift</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_07_gse_openshift</guid><description/></item><item><title>On-premise data centers do not need to be legacy</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_04_datacenter</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_04_datacenter</guid><description/></item><item><title>Start contributing to an Open Source community now!</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_02_opensource</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2023_02_02_opensource</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fedora Sway artifacts approved by FESCo</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2023/01/04/fedora-sway-artifacts-approved-by-fesco</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2023_01_04_fedora_sway_artifacts_approved_by_fesco.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2023/01/04/fedora-sway-artifacts-approved-by-fesco</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in August, I &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2022/08/12/fedora-sway-ostree-spin-name/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; for suggestions for a name for an os-tree-based Fedora version with Sway.
Although I&amp;rsquo;ve not posted anything more on the topic, the work went forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have asked Fedora Council to approve the naming, to FESCo for the approval for the change to Fedora, and to RelEng support to merge our work in the Fedora workstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, the Fedora Council &lt;a href="https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/424"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the request to create a &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; spin called &amp;ldquo;Fedora Sway spin&amp;rdquo; as well as an os-tree spin called &amp;ldquo;Fedora Sericea&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>LaTeX spreadtab cells reference</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/12/28/latex-spreadtab-cells-reference</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_12_28_latex_spreadtab_cells_reference.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/12/28/latex-spreadtab-cells-reference</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I create LaTeX files containing complex tables with many correlated numbers, I use &lt;a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/spreadtab?lang=en"&gt;spreadtab&lt;/a&gt;.

Cells references are an example of this, but it is a critical topic for this package, so those are the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered to sum a column of values.
To do so, I&amp;rsquo;ll take the example of page 19 of the package documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Gopass 1.15 in Fedora 37</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/12/21/gopass-1_15-in-fedora-37</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_12_21_gopass_115_in_fedora_37.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/12/21/gopass-1_15-in-fedora-37</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in April, I &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2022/04/25/gopass-in-fedora"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the availability of gopass in the Fedora repositories.
In the last few months, though, gopass had multiple releases, many of which arrived in Fedora 38 but not Fedora 37.
Since Fedora 38 will be released in a few months, most users are not using it, and therefore those releases are not directly benefitting those users.
The reason for the delayed update for Fedora 37 is that the dependencies of gopass changed in the course of those updates, and the Fedora process makes updating packages with many dependencies changes more painful than it could be.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Use SSH to proxy web traffic</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/11/29/use-ssh-to-proxy-web-traffic</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_11_29_use_ssh_to_proxy_web_traffic.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/11/29/use-ssh-to-proxy-web-traffic</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As discusse in a &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2022/06/30/nebula-on-fedora"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I use nebula to create a VPN connection between the various machines I use.
Usually what I really care about this setup is the ability of consuming services those machine expose on my nebula network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I travel, I prefer to proxy my data through my nebula network.
This allows me to not have to care about the limitations imposed in those networks, as long as I&amp;rsquo;m able to open my tunnel.
The second advantage I have, is that I can choose the location where my traffic leaves my VPN, since I have multiple machines in multiple nations.
Another advantage is that I can be sure that no data is visibile by the network manager, even if this is becoming less and less relevant, since the majority of the traffic is encrypted nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Red Hat EX374 exam</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/11/16/red-hat-ex374-exam</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_11_16_red_hat_ex374_exam.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/11/16/red-hat-ex374-exam</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I did the &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/red-hat-certified-specialist-developing-automation-ansible-automation-platform-exam"&gt;Red Hat EX374 exam&lt;/a&gt;, which allows becoming Red Hat Certified Specialist in Developing Automation with Ansible Automation Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exam is my sixth Ansible exam/certification, so the question is always, how is this similar or different from the others?
This exam is one of the furthest ones from the others since it focuses on Ansible Automation Platform 2 instead of Ansible Core or Ansible Tower.

This phenomenon frequently happens to me because I consider a product and a technology two completely different things.
At the same time, many people use them interchangeably when discussing IT products and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this distinction&amp;rsquo;s value is clearly distinguishing the solutions that are resilient to a single entity failure and those that are not.
Suppose the producer of a product goes out of business or, for any reason, will not do additional business with you.
In that case, you lose the ability to buy that product and, sometimes, even use it completely.
This limitation does not apply to a technology since you should be able to access it, regardless of the specific vendor.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>From Infrastructure as Code to Policy as Code</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/09/30/from-infrastructure-as-code-to-policy-as-code</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_09_30_from_infrastructure_as_code_to_policy_as_code.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/09/30/from-infrastructure-as-code-to-policy-as-code</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I still remember when 15 years ago, the topic of Infrastructure as Code was beginning to be discussed.
At the time, the majority of tools we know and use for Infrastructure as Code did not exist.
Some people and companies realized the need for such a paradigm, while many others were skeptical or against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, I had a kind of a Deja Vu when I started to have conversations with some stakeholders around Policy as Code, or as someone prefers to call it, Compliance as Code.
The idea behind Policy as Code is that if it was possible to write policies in a language that is both easily readable by a human and a computer, we could better govern IT.
Policy as Code is not a new concept by itself.
In fact, in Infrastructure as Code software such as Ansible, it is possible to create a Playbook to assess if a system is in the expected state.
The problem, though, is that a Playbook written with Ansible with this scope is not always evident if read by people that are not highly trained on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Analytics and EU rules</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/09/26/google-analytics-and-eu-rules</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_09_26_google_analytics_and_eu_rules.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/09/26/google-analytics-and-eu-rules</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, we have witnessed multiple European Data Protection offices weigh on the legitimacy of Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to pick this up instead of a different board because of its sheer connectivity.

I was most interested in the two 10GbE due to some projects I have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was interested in installing Fedora, which proved very easy.
The first time I created a bootable micro-SD card with Fedora, it worked perfectly out of the box.
After a few tests, I decided to install Fedora on a SATA drive.
The SATA installation proved a bit more complex because I assumed it could boot from USB, but I did not manage to do so.
I then moved the Fedora ISO to a micro-SD card and installed it from there, which proved to work flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nebula on Fedora</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/06/30/nebula-on-fedora</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_06_30_nebula_on_fedora.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/06/30/nebula-on-fedora</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I moved more and more data and services to hardware that I can directly control.

The DB connection injection is needed because creating a new SQL connection every time there is a new gRPC request (and tearing it down at the end) is a massive waste of resources.
Also, this approach could limit the scalability of the API since the database probably has a limited number of connections it will accept.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>gRPC-Gateway 2 in Fedora</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/02/22/grpc-gateway-2-in-fedora</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_02_22_grpc_gateway_2_in_fedora.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/02/22/grpc-gateway-2-in-fedora</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;gRPC is a very nice technology that allows the implementation of efficient APIs in a very efficient way.
Thanks to gRPC and protobuf, you do not have to write much boilerplate code since the boilerplate code is generated automatically from the &lt;code&gt;proto&lt;/code&gt; file.
This works perfectly until both your client and server can perform gRPC calls.
Luckily most of the languages have no issue with this.
Still, the big exception is JavaScript (and other languages that will compile to JS, such as TypeScript) running in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>pdfcpu in Fedora</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/02/19/pdfcpu-in-fedora</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_02_19_pdfcpu_in_fedora.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/02/19/pdfcpu-in-fedora</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;pdfcpu is a command-line tool to perform actions on PDF files.

I think most of the comments around it have missed the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-little-bit-of-history"&gt;A little bit of history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brief history begins at the end of the &amp;rsquo;90s when the EU and the US agreed on the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. On the 26th July 2000, the European Commission (EC) formalized it with the Commission Decision 2000/520/EC, where it was defined that data could be freely moved from the EU to the US.
The assumption was that the data on US soil would have comparable (or better) protection than the same data on EU soil, and therefore the privacy of European citizens was not at risk.
On 6th October 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidated this decision on the basis that in the US laws were authorizing public authorities to have access on a generalized basis to the content of electronic communications, and this was deemed to be &amp;ldquo;compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life&amp;rdquo; (the quote is from the ECJ decision).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google and Facebook fined for cookies practices</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2022/01/10/google-and-facebook-fined-for-cookies-practices</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2022_01_10_google_and_facebook_fined_for_cookies_practices.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2022/01/10/google-and-facebook-fined-for-cookies-practices</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The CNIL, France&amp;rsquo;s data regulator, fined Meta (Facebook) and Google for violating the GDPR for a total of 210M€.
More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google LLC (USA) got fined 90M€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Ireland Limited got fined 60M€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook Ireland Limited got fined 60M€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if the companies will not fix the issue within three months, an additional penalty of 100'000€/day will be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two facts that I think are very interesting about these fines:

The three most important are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the creation of CentOS Stream and the consequent rename of CentOS (the classic Linux distribution the project is known for) in CentOS Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the anticipation to today (31/12/2021) of the End Of Life for CentOS Linux 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fact that CentOS Linux 8 is going to be the last and that from now on, only CentOS Stream will have new releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That announcement created a lot of different sentiments in the community and even more among the CentOS Linux users.

In a way, it is excellent that people that are not tech-savvy start to learn about the Web, how it works, and where it might go, since they are using it consciously or not to perform the majority of tasks in their lives.
The issue I have with this, though, is that no one of them could explain how it would work or why they are so confident that the future is going in that direction.
The only thing they could associate with Web3 was that cryptocurrencies would be the future, and their value would go to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The risk of a Cloud shutdown</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2021/10/31/the-risk-of-a-cloud-shutdown</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2021_10_31_the_risk_of_a_cloud_shutdown.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2021/10/31/the-risk-of-a-cloud-shutdown</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I often see people and companies moving their workloads to the cloud.
Speaking with them, they explain that the cloud is cheaper, more flexible, and more reliable than their current infrastructure.
To further increase investment return, they often target a specific (single) cloud to reduce management costs and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By itself, this trend seems a very reasonable one.
The risk is that, sometimes, people do not consider the less immediate risks around this move.
There are many of those risks, and if there is an appetite for it, I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking further about the other dangers, but now I would like to focus on a specific one: the risk of a shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Professional Cloud Architect</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2021/09/20/google-professional-cloud-architect</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2021_09_20_google_professional_cloud_architect.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2021/09/20/google-professional-cloud-architect</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After having renewed the &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2021/08/25/google-associate-cloud-engineer"&gt;Google Associate Cloud Engineer certification&lt;/a&gt;, it was the moment to renew the &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/30/google-professional-cloud-architect"&gt;Google Professional Cloud Architect certification&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wanted to keep Windows on my laptop for the smallest amount of time possible, I decided to book the Professional Cloud Architect exam the day after the Associate Cloud Engineer one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the exam day (18th of August), having had experience the previous day, I ensured to set up everything correctly.
As I did the previous day, I decided to use my Lenovo Bluetooth Laser Mouse.
The exam started without any hiccups at 15:00.
At around 15:30, I moved the mouse wheel to the left, triggering a &amp;ldquo;back&amp;rdquo; signal, equivalent to press the &amp;ldquo;back&amp;rdquo; button in a browser.
Kryterion Sentinel decided that the proper way to handle such a signal was to interrupt the exam.
I tried to call the Kriterion call centers, but a recorded voice informed me that the fastest way to access their customer care was via chat.
I opened a chat with their support and got put in a queue of about 20 people.
After 40 minutes, I managed to chat with a support representative, and they managed to schedule a new exam session for me a couple of minutes later (16:15).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Associate Cloud Engineer</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2021/08/25/google-associate-cloud-engineer</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2021_08_25_google_associate_cloud_engineer.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2021/08/25/google-associate-cloud-engineer</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/24/google-associate-cloud-engineer"&gt;obtained the Google Associate Cloud Engineer certification&lt;/a&gt;, so it was re-certification time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it is August and probably also due to the whole ongoing health situation, I&amp;rsquo;ve not found any test center at a reasonable distance.
Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use the Online Proctored option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google relies on Kryterion for their exams, as many other companies do, since Kryterion has more than 1100 associated test centers and, at least in the ICT certification space, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most commonly used networks.
Having had experience with Red Hat remote certifications, I was expecting at least the same level of user experience with Kryterion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CORS headers with gRPC-Gateway</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2021/07/28/cors-headers-with-grpc-gateway</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2021_07_28_cors_headers_with_grpc_gateway.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2021/07/28/cors-headers-with-grpc-gateway</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I wrote a &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2018/11/18/cors-with-go-and-negroni"&gt;blog post on managing CORS headers with Negroni&lt;/a&gt;.
Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new API server that needed to be accessible from the browser, but this time I used a different technology, more precisely gRPC-Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few months after I wrote that blog post, I stopped writing new REST services by hand.
I did not rewrite all the services that used the old paradigm just because they needed a fix or a new feature, but for all new services, I moved to gRPC with gRPC-Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sensible datetime scale for Gonum Plot</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2021/06/28/sensible-datetime-scale-for-gonum-plot</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2021_06_28_sensible_datetime_scale_for_gonum.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2021/06/28/sensible-datetime-scale-for-gonum-plot</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Few months ago I &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2021/01/20/sensible-integer-scale-for-gonum-plot"&gt;posted a library for sensible int scale for Gonum Plot&lt;/a&gt;.
There is a similar package I&amp;rsquo;ve developed to handle timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integer one, being based on a recursive function, works with any number scale.
Differently, this one will only work well with a timescale between 2 days and a couple of years.
Extending it is not hard since it&amp;rsquo;s enough to add additional &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statements in the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not found use-cases for different timeframes so far.

&lt;p&gt;Cookies are always a hot theme when we talk about GDPR.
I still see websites handing out cookies (first and third parties ones) without a cookie banner or to users who have not pressed the &amp;ldquo;accept&amp;rdquo; button on the cookie banner.
Also, speaking about cookie banners, the majority are not compliant since they often make it hard to refuse cookies or pre-select cookie acceptance.
This situation is unfortunate, but we see some movement on this (like the &lt;a href="https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-aims-end-cookie-banner-terror-and-issues-more-500-gdpr-complaints"&gt;noyb initiative&lt;/a&gt;).

I remember that I started to play with immutable Fedora back in 2015 when Fedora Atomic was new.
I liked the idea since the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve read about it, but in the beginning, I did not spend too much time making it work on my setup because it seemed a little bit too complex.
At DevConf.cz 2016, I met Patrick Uiterwijk, who was running his spin of Fedora Atomic.
We had a long chat on it, and he explained to me his workflow.
Soon after, I started to use an immutable version of Fedora on my personal laptop, but I was not daring to use it on my work laptop.
When I left Red Hat at the end of 2017, my personal laptop became my only laptop for a little while, and the immutable Fedora became my only OS.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using only immutable Fedora on my computers.
In June 2020, I took the time to clean up my build process and files, and I moved all the needed bits to a new git repo that is now openly available and can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/Fale/fale-desktop"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Certified Specialist in Services Management and Automation</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2021/03/31/red-hat-certified-specialist-in-services-management-and-automation</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2021_03_31_red_hat_certified_specialist_in_service_management_and_automation.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2021/03/31/red-hat-certified-specialist-in-services-management-and-automation</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Late last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve read that a new Ansible-related exam was available: the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Services Management and Automation exam (EX358).

It was the first time I did a Red Hat exam that was brand new and without having the possibility of finding online some opinions around it.&lt;/p&gt;

If you know before-hand the values that can be expected to be created by the application, it is very straightforward, but the majority of times, this is not the case.

It was the first time I attempted the RHCE exam, but I prepared myself in the past for the EX300 exam, the exam that allowed you to obtain the RHCE certification in the RHEL7 time, but never got around to do the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to what I had to study for the EX300, I found the EX294 program way more sensible.
An aspect I&amp;rsquo;ve never liked about the EX300 was that you needed to learn many implementation details, such as the in-scope applications&amp;rsquo; configuration format.
EX294 changed this aspect since it is based on Ansible, and Ansible abstracts the majority of implementation details of the various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Obtain previous Job ID in Ansible Tower Workflow</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/11/15/obtain-previous-job-id-in-ansible-tower-workflow</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_11_15_obtain_previous_job_id_in_ansible_tower_workflow.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/11/15/obtain-previous-job-id-in-ansible-tower-workflow</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible Tower allows you to create Workflows, which enable you to create complex workflows by putting together multiple Ansible Playbooks.
Ansible Tower Workflows can have some simple logics, such as run different Ansible Playbooks based on the outcome (success or failure) of a previous Ansible Playbook run.
Sometimes, though, you need to have more information about a previous Ansible Playbook run than just the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found myself in a situation where I had an Ansible Tower Workflow with two Ansible Playbooks into it, where the first one was performing specific tasks.
The second one needed to get and process the output of the first Ansible Playbook.
Since Ansible Tower provides an API to fetch an Ansible Playbook run output, this part is trivial if you know the Job ID that Ansible Tower assigned to that specific run.
Looking around, I&amp;rsquo;ve not found much information on how to retrieve the Job ID of a different Job, so I looked at the various APIs and found this solution, which I&amp;rsquo;m going to share with you today.
I&amp;rsquo;ve not found much information about getting another Job ID because it is usually a bad practice to do such a thing and that very often you can achieve the same goal in a much cleaner way.
This better option, though, was not present in my case.
Due to many constraints I had in this project, this was the best way I&amp;rsquo;ve found, even if I&amp;rsquo;ve tried - at least mentally - many other ways before accepting that this was the only one in my case.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Red Hat Certified System Administrator</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/10/01/red-hat-certified-system-administrator</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_10_01_red_hat_certified_system_administrator.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/10/01/red-hat-certified-system-administrator</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I did pass this exam, but since then, the certification expired, so I had to re-take the exam.
While the first time I did the exam in a testing center, this time I had to do it at home since all test centers are closed.
The experience of doing the exam at home has been a very positive one since you can arrange the environment as it better fits you.
You can have as much light as you like (within sensible limits), you can use the chair you prefer and the desk orientation you prefer.
You will not be allowed to bring cheating sheets or similar things since the proctor will ask you to show the whole room using the webcam, as you might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On public TLS certificates lifetime</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/09/13/on-public-tls-certificates-lifetime</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_09_13_on_public_tls_certificates_lifetime.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/09/13/on-public-tls-certificates-lifetime</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On September 1st, 2020, the maximum lifetime of TLS certificates signed by Public Certificate Authority got reduced to 13 months.
How did we arrive here, and what&amp;rsquo;s to come?
Let&amp;rsquo;s start from understanding who decides the maximum lifetime of certificates and many other limitations around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="who-decides-the-tls-certificate-guidelines"&gt;Who decides the TLS certificate guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the client (often a browser or an operating system) identifies the certificate as trustable or not (based on the CA that signed it as well as many other parameters), so the client can decide which parameters to look for and which values are acceptable and which are not.
This clients&amp;rsquo; freedom makes the whole situation very messy since every client can decide their own set, and a subset of the options accepted by every client can be very small if not empty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2020</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/08/20/kubecon--cloudnativecon-europe-2020</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_08_20_kubecon_eu_2020.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/08/20/kubecon--cloudnativecon-europe-2020</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year I managed to partecipate to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2020.
As you can imagine, the conference did not happen in real life, but it was converted to an online conference.
More virtual conferences I attend to, more I understand the limits and the advantages of them compared to real conferences.
In this particular conference, I realized that one of the biggest problems I have with virtual conferences is that, during the conference, the conference events and talks add to your usual events and meetings, making it impossible to follow all events you wanted to follow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fedora Nest 2020</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/08/10/fedora-nest-2020</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_08_10_fedora_nest_2020.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/08/10/fedora-nest-2020</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year Flock did not happen due to COVID-19, and in its place, Fedora Nest happened.
After many events I&amp;rsquo;ve seen going virtual in the last few months, I was skeptical.
I was yet to see an acceptable online platform to run events.
I was wrong on the platform.
Fedora Nest used &lt;a href="https://hopin.to/"&gt;Hopin&lt;/a&gt;, which is by far the best platform for events I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get your expectations too high, though, because when I say the best one I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far, only means that it is usable, and it does not mean in any way that is on par of real conferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A website with no cookies</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/07/19/a-website-with-no-cookies</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_07_19_a_website_with_no_cookies.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/07/19/a-website-with-no-cookies</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I did a big update to this website.

More specifically, the most relevant ones, in my opinion, are (sorted by date):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 11, AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-m6g-ec2-instances-powered-by-arm-based-aws-graviton2/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the availability of new instance types (M6g, C6g, R6g) based on &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/"&gt;Graviton2&lt;/a&gt;, a new version of their in-house developed ARM processor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On June 17, Ampere &lt;a href="https://amperecomputing.com/our-cores-are-expanding-to-128-a-family-of-compatible-products/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a 128 core ARM processor that will be added to their current line (that includes 32, 48, 64, 72, 80 cores ARM CPUs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On June 22, was &lt;a href="https://www.top500.org/news/japan-captures-top500-crown-arm-powered-supercomputer/"&gt;made public&lt;/a&gt; that Fugaku, an ARM-based supercomputer, is the most potent publicly disclosed supercomputer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On June 22, Apple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_ARM"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Macs will move to ARM
Those pieces of news demonstrate how much the processors&amp;rsquo; landscape is changing, and how fast the rate of change is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic I would like to focus on is why, today, the x86 platform is not that appealing as it was in the &amp;rsquo;90s when it became the de-facto standard.
I think that there are two primary causes for this change of direction:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Practical Ansible 2</title><link>https://fale.io/publication/practical_ansible_2</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/publication/practical_ansible_2.jpg"/><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/publication/practical_ansible_2</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible enables you to automate software provisioning, configuration management, and application roll-outs, and can be used as a deployment and orchestration tool. While Ansible provides simple yet powerful features to automate multi-layer environments using agentless communication, it can also solve other critical IT challenges, such as ensuring continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) with zero downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll work with Ansible 2.9 and learn to solve complex issues quickly with the help of task-oriented scenarios. You&amp;rsquo;ll start by installing and configuring Ansible on Linux and macOS to automate monotonous and repetitive IT tasks and get to grips with concepts such as playbooks, inventories, and network modules. As you progress, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain insight into the YAML syntax and learn how to port between Ansible versions. In addition to this, you&amp;rsquo;ll also understand how Ansible enables you to orchestrate multi-layer environments such as networks, containers, and the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GDPR - 2 years later</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/05/25/gdpr-2-years-later</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_05_25_gdpr_2_years_later.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/05/25/gdpr-2-years-later</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As it is becoming a sort of tradition, here we are, after two years from the enactment of GDPR to see how it performs in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2019/05/25/gdpr-1-year-later"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; yearly check, we analyzed the situation from two points of view: the banners and the fines.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how those two topics have evolved in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-cookie-banners"&gt;The Cookie Banners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of October 2019, with the &lt;a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/documents.jsf?num=C-673/17#"&gt;judgment in case C-673/17&lt;/a&gt;, the European Union Court of Justice clarified that pre-ticketed consent checkboxes are not sufficient since the consent has to be expressed actively by the user.
This requirement was clear to me since my initial approaches to the GDPR, since it was clear that this was the only way to respect the Regulation&amp;rsquo;s spirit.
Still, it is very nice to see it stated explicitly by the European Union Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why I switched to systemd-resolved</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/04/15/why-i-switched-to-systemd-resolved</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_04_15_why_i_switched_to_systemd-resolved.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/04/15/why-i-switched-to-systemd-resolved</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a &lt;a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/VPACQVWRG5HCWRPBIOTBAENRT6V6PRA4/"&gt;controversial proposal&lt;/a&gt; got posted in the Fedora Devel mailing list: enable systemd-resolved by default.
I see this change favorably since I already enabled it a few weeks ago, and I find it a very sensible option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I have to admit that I see systemd and its mission of standardizing the core of the Linux user-space very favorably.
At the current level of evolution of Linux, over time, this standardization and consistency will pay off much more than other alternatives.
Therefore, I see the introduction of systemd-resolved positively and as an excellent way to abstract many DNS-related problems the rest of the applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VPN with NAT in Google Cloud</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/03/01/vpn-with-nat-in-google-cloud</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_03_01_vpn_with_nat_in_google_cloud.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/03/01/vpn-with-nat-in-google-cloud</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud provides the capability of terminating a VPN connection with a VPN Gateway.
The problem is that the VPN Gateway - at the moment - is relatively limited in capabilities.
One of the missing capabilities I would have liked to see implemented is the NAT capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPNs can be used to connect the machines of two different parties.
Although this is usually not the best architectural pattern, since a connection on the public internet encrypted at the Transport Layer is often a better option, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively common in more legacy environments.
When a VPN is used in this way, it is very common to incur in an IP space collision, and therefore it becomes required to use some form of NAT.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to implement this scenario in Google Cloud without terminating the VPN directly on an instance (which is possible but has its problems, and maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing it some point in the future).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Old posts</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/02/28/old-posts</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_02_28_old_posts.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/02/28/old-posts</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to clean up many old backups I have lying around.

I found multiple backups of my old web blogs in the process, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to get the posts (and maybe also the comments in a second phase) out of those backups and re-publish them here on this website.
So, if some old posts will appear in this blog in the next few months, don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>FOSDEM 2020</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/02/02/fosdem-2020</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_02_02_fosdem_2020.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/02/02/fosdem-2020</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year, as it has happened for the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been at FOSDEM.
As always, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed it a lot, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I continue to go there, and every time I have to suggest other people which events to attend in Europe, I always mention FOSDEM as the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see how room sizes and crowdedness of the rooms changes over time.
Years ago, the container-related rooms (containers, container security, Go) were relatively small, but already crowded, and over the years, the rooms got bigger and bigger.
Every year they have been very crowded to the point that for the majority of sessions, some people were turned away.
This year this pattern continued for those rooms, except for the Go one, which had a massive improvement in size, and, as far as I know, it never turned away people due to the over-crowdedness.
I think this speaks clearly on the importance that containers are getting in those years and the fact that they are quickly moving.
If there were no innovations in the container space for the whole year between two FOSDEMs, I think many people would prefer to go to other rooms.
I think this is what is happening to the Go room.
Even though I really appreciate the Go room and the Go language, I think it will shrink over the next years because - as it&amp;rsquo;s sane for a programming language - Go is not getting tons of new features every year.
Due to this lack of news, people that already know the language might opt for different rooms since, at FOSDEM, there are always many exciting talks at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DevConf 2020</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2020/01/27/devconf-2020</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2020_01_27_devconf.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2020/01/27/devconf-2020</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As it happened at other times in my life, I managed to be present at DevConf.
DevConf is one of the best conferences that I attend.
The reasons are many and varied, starting from the location that I find relatively stress-free.
Another reason is the fact that there are many different kinds of sessions, and many sessions are not overcrowded, so it is relatively simple to participate in any session you would like to.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Resource scarcity in Public Clouds</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/12/10/resource-scarcity-in-public-clouds</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_12_10_resource_scarcity_in_public_clouds.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/12/10/resource-scarcity-in-public-clouds</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen problems allocating resources in the Google Cloud Platform in the Frankfurt region.

The exam was fairly different this time from the previous time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed is that the certification itself is no longer expiring after 2 years since the validity got extended to 3 years.

I was sure to pass the exam, but since in the company I work for other people will be required to become AWS certified, I wanted to check out the exam beforehand, to be able to suggest to the people the right certification for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam is fairly straight forward and is mainly focused on the advantages of AWS and cloud in general.
There is a high amount of questions around the advantages of cloud in scaling, reliability and costs profile.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Cloud Snapshot Cleaner v0.2.0</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/09/22/google-cloud-snapshot-cleaner-v0_2_0</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_09_22_gcsc_v0_2_0.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/09/22/google-cloud-snapshot-cleaner-v0_2_0</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, in a &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2019/09/16/google-cloud-snapshot-cleaner-v0.1.0"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve introduced you to &lt;a href="https://github.com/Fale/gcsc"&gt;gcsc&lt;/a&gt; (Google Cloud Snapshot Cleaner).
I&amp;rsquo;ve just released the version 0.2.0 of it, and it has a lot of clean-ups done, both in the code and the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some new features, but the one I&amp;rsquo;m more satisfied with, is the introduction of the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; subcommand, to expose an HTTP server.

The idea behind this small software is to create a more flexible way to keep the Google Cloud Disks Snapshots tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud does provide a very nice way to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots"&gt;automatically snapshot your disks&lt;/a&gt;, leveraging the &lt;strong&gt;resource policies&lt;/strong&gt;.
This is very nice, since it allows you to be sure that the Google Cloud always and reliably snapshots your disks.
The tool also allows you to auto-delete the snapshots after a certain period, but I found this feature a little bit too limited.
The main reason is that it does not allow you to have complex retention policies.
In fact, the tool only allows to set a single expiration date for all snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Professional Cloud Architect</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/30/google-professional-cloud-architect</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_08_30_google_professional_cloud_architect.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/30/google-professional-cloud-architect</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After less than a week from achieving the &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/24/google-associate-cloud-engineer"&gt;Google Associate Cloud Engineer&lt;/a&gt; certification, I took the Google Professional Cloud Architect exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing this exam, I found odd the fact that Google provides three case studies to bring to the exam.
I was even more impressed by the number of questions around those cases.
It felt odd since it felt like you could prepare very well those three case studies and be advantaged in the exam.
Overall, I think that this is not the case, since having prepared the cases, will only help you not having to re-read the whole case before answering the questions.
Also, I found myself to read the case name, read the question, read the answers, choose the answer, and then read the case text again, just to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Associate Cloud Engineer</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/24/google-associate-cloud-engineer</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_08_24_google_associate_cloud_engineer.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/24/google-associate-cloud-engineer</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As for a company certification goal, I decided to certify as a Google Associate Cloud Engineer as well as &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2019/08/30/google-professional-cloud-architect"&gt;Google Professional Cloud Architect&lt;/a&gt; this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Associate Cloud Engineer certification is mainly focused around GCP standard operations, such as managing IAM, osLogin, as well as many other core services such as compute instances, Cloud SQL and many more.
I found the certification to be fairly well balanced, with maybe a little bit a skew toward IAM and security, which I do appreciate due to the importance of these topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Huge privacy fines are good, now we need more of them</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/07/14/huge-privacy-fines-are-good-now-we-need-more-of-them</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_07_14_huge_privacy_fines_are_good_now_we_need_more_of_them.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/07/14/huge-privacy-fines-are-good-now-we-need-more-of-them</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few days, multiple fines related to privacy have been announced.

&lt;p&gt;After the inception of Bitcoin around ten years ago, we got more and more used to new cryptocurrencies being presented every other day.
Often those projects are created by small teams of people, often anonymously.
Facebook&amp;rsquo;s announcement is very different since Facebook is a huge company and has partnered with many other huge companies for this launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very skeptical of Libra, and I think it will not succeed in the long run.
In fact, it already starts with big challenges, including the fact that most people do not trust Facebook.
Differently from many companies, Facebook is used by many people, but it is not generally trusted, and the base requirement for the success of any kind of currency is the trust in the entity behind it.
Libra will be managed by the Libra Alliance and not Facebook directly.
Still, so far, we have seen a much more significant presence of Facebook than any other Libra Alliance member, so easily Libra will still be referred to as &amp;ldquo;the Facebook cryptocurrency&amp;rdquo; many years from now.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GDPR - 1 year later</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/05/25/gdpr-1-year-later</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_05_25_gdpr_1_year_later.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/05/25/gdpr-1-year-later</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One year has passed by the 25/05/2018, the day that the GDPR started to be enforced.
Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to see how this first year of GDPR went and what we could be expecting for the future given what we have seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first consideration that I think is obvious but interesting is that the Internet did not close down on the 25/05/2018 as many were worried.
In fact, not much changed on that day.
A thing that did change a lot is the number of banners asking the authorization to give some cookies to your browser.
This increase of cookie banners is an interesting phenomenon since the differences between the EU cookie law and the GDPR on cookies are minor.
I think this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that now companies are more worried about violating those regulations than before, thanks to the massive fines that they can incur into with the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bootstrap2hugo upgraded to Bootstrap 4</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/04/30/bootstrap2hugo-upgraded-to-bootstrap-4</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_04_30_bootstrap2hugo_upgraded_to_bootstrap_4.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/04/30/bootstrap2hugo-upgraded-to-bootstrap-4</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Hugo for my website as well as other websites as well.
My first Hugo website was my own since I wanted to learn more about the technology before suggesting it to anyone else.
Back then I was not able to find any minimalistic theme I liked, and for that reason, I started &lt;a href="https://github.com/Fale/bootstrap2hugo"&gt;my own&lt;/a&gt;.
As you can imagine from the name, I based it on Bootstrap, version 3 since that was the current version when I started to work on it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made some minor updates over the last few years, but it was still based on Bootstrap 3.
In the last couple of months I did some commits in a branch to bring it to Bootstrap 4, and today I merged them in &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, so the template now is based on Bootstrap 4.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Learning Ansible 2.7 - Third Edition</title><link>https://fale.io/publication/learning_ansible_2_7</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/publication/learning_ansible_27.jpg"/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/publication/learning_ansible_2_7</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible is an open source automation platform that assists organizations with tasks such as application deployment, orchestration, and task automation.
With the release of Ansible 2.7, even complex tasks can be handled much more easily than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning Ansible 2.7 will help you take your first steps toward understanding the fundamentals and practical aspects of Ansible by introducing you to topics such as playbooks, modules, and installation of Linux, Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), and Windows Support.
In addition to this, you will focus on various testing strategies, deployment, and orchestration to build on your knowledge.
The book will then help you get accustomed to features including cleaner architecture, task blocks, and playbook parsing, which can help you to streamline automation processes.
Next, you will learn how to integrate Ansible with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) before gaining insights into the enterprise versions of Ansible, Ansible Tower and Ansible Galaxy.
This will help you to use Ansible to interact with different operating systems and improve your working efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GoLang vanity urls on AWS Lambda</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2019/03/21/golang-vanity-urls-on-aws-lambda</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2019_03_21_golang_vanity_urls_on_aws_lambda.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2019/03/21/golang-vanity-urls-on-aws-lambda</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2019/01/18/reasons-to-prefer-vanity-urls-for-golang-packages/"&gt;article on the reasons to use vanity URLs in Go&lt;/a&gt; and the one about &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2018/09/23/a-lightweight-approach-to-go-vanity-import-paths/"&gt;how to implement a lightweight vanity URLs provider&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you how you can leverage AWS Lambda to implement a vanity URLs provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we want to import the “test” package that is hosted at &lt;code&gt;github.com/fale/test&lt;/code&gt;, we will need to use &lt;code&gt;github.com/fale/test&lt;/code&gt;.
On the one hand, this is very nice since it allows anyone reading the code to immediately understand where the code is hosted and therefore find it very quickly.
Also, this URL-based import path guarantees that no two different packages can have the same import path, preventing this kind of confusion for both programmers and the compiler itself.
On the other hand, this is a limitation since it makes the code very reliant on the repository location.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Calling a SOAP service in Go</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2018/12/03/calling-a-soap-service-in-go</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2018_12_03_calling_a_soap_service_in_go.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2018/12/03/calling-a-soap-service-in-go</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today the IT world is very focused on high performance, high throughput interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;The SSPL is a new license, just created by MongoDB.
In the post, Eliot points out that they created the SSPL starting from the AGPL, and he affirms that the new license guarantees all the freedoms the AGPL does.
I firmly believe that the SSPL is not a FLOSS license since it limits the possibility of the cloud providers to provide an &amp;ldquo;as a service&amp;rdquo; version of it.
This case might seem trivial and an edge case, but the complete freedom of usage is one of the FLOSS movement and licenses pillars.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A lightweight approach to Go vanity import paths</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2018/09/23/a-lightweight-approach-to-go-vanity-import-paths</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2018_09_23_a_lightweight_approach_to_go_vanity_import_paths.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2018/09/23/a-lightweight-approach-to-go-vanity-import-paths</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Golang uses URLs for the dependencies packages resolution.
To unbundle the code repository hosting the package and the import path, Golang supports the idea of Vanity Import Paths.
The way this has been implemented is that, as long as the import path points to a page where Go can find the real package URL, it will follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we will need to create a web server that can serve pages in a way that the Go toolchains can understand.
To do so, I use the following code:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A small HTTP debug server in Go</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2018/08/31/a-small-http-debug-server-in-go</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2018_08_31_a_small_http_debug_server_in_go.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2018/08/31/a-small-http-debug-server-in-go</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I found myself to work on an application that was communicating via SOAP with a server.
My goal was to understand how this application worked with the SOAP server to emulate its behavior.
Even if I had access to the source code of the application, I thought it would have been easier, faster and more fun to do the work without actually reading the code.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that actually, the application is fairly small and self-contained.

&lt;p&gt;This message is remembering you that you forgot to provide &lt;strong&gt;Root Certificate Authorities&lt;/strong&gt; to your application.

Being in the same room for the whole Saturday allowed me to follow more talks (no time wasted moving from a room to another and less sitting problems :D) which was convenient since I wanted to follow all talks in that room anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why DevOps is just a buzzword</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2018/01/05/why-devops-is-just-a-buzzword</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2018_01_05_why_devops_is_just_a_buzzword.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2018/01/05/why-devops-is-just-a-buzzword</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I found myself multiple times in situations where people were trying to explain to me how much they are (or would like to be) DevOps and how awesome DevOps is and how productive their teams had become since when they merged the Dev team and the Ops team, and they don&amp;rsquo;t have any team which is not DevOps and application-centric.
I usually stare at them thinking that they have no idea what they are talking about, or they have just outsourced all the non-application-centric side of their IT and have not realized it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Walkthrough a PEM file in Go</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/12/21/walkthrough-a-pem-file-in-go</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_12_21_walkthrough_a_pem_file_in_go.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/12/21/walkthrough-a-pem-file-in-go</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I posted how to create a PKI in Go.
Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to add share a useful function (at least from my point of view) that I found myself to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem arose when I had a function that required as input a &lt;code&gt;*pem.Block&lt;/code&gt; of the public key, but all I had was the &lt;strong&gt;PEM file&lt;/strong&gt; containing, as you can imagine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Private Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Public Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the CA Public Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a typical situation, and for this, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a function I wrote to extract it.
I know that it&amp;rsquo;s probably not perfect, but it could be a good starting point for many of you, and if you have suggestions, please leave a comment down below or send me an email, and I&amp;rsquo;ll update the post!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SSH with Yubikey</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/11/03/ssh-with-yubikey</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_11_03_ssh_tih_yubikey.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/11/03/ssh-with-yubikey</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="authentication-factors"&gt;Authentication factors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the common way to create more secure authentication in systems is adding more &amp;ldquo;factors&amp;rdquo;, creating in this way a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
The idea behind MFA is that there are many different ways to authenticate a user, and those can be split in different &amp;ldquo;categories&amp;rdquo; based on the kind of challenge we require.
Generally speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s common to divide the authentication methods in mainly three categories:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ansible Tower LDAP with self signed CA</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/10/06/ansible-tower-ldap-with-self-signed-ca</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_10_06_ansible_tower_ldap_with_selfsigned_ca.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/10/06/ansible-tower-ldap-with-self-signed-ca</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the big advantages that Ansible Tower and AWX (the open source and upstream version of Ansible Tower) bring to the table is the Role Base Access Control (RBAC).
This will allow you to select which users (or teams) will be able to see which objects in Ansible Tower as well as which jobs they will be able to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously to leverage the RBAC, you will have to have personal accounts for every user of your platform.
Now, this can be very complex to do when you have hundreds of users, if you consider than you should then manage those users.
Also, you probably already have those information in your company LDAP or Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ansible - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2017_09_25_ansible</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2017_09_25_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ansible Tower Open Source</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/09/07/ansible-tower-open-source</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_09_07_ansible_tower_open_source.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/09/07/ansible-tower-open-source</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In October 2015, Red Hat bought Ansible Inc.
As far as I know, in the acquisition, two close source components got acquired by Red Hat: Ansible Tower and Ansible Galaxy.
Since the day of the acquisition, Red Hat has been very clear on the fact that those two components would have become open source at a certain point, even if there was not a public date or timeline yet.
Making a codebase open source is not always easy and quick process.
A lot of times many aspects need attention, from a legal review of the commits to a security audit of the code.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ansible Tower 3.1 High Availability maintenance</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/08/18/ansible-tower-3_1-high-availability-maintenance</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_08_18_ansible_tower_ha_maintenance.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/08/18/ansible-tower-3_1-high-availability-maintenance</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Around one year ago, I did a post around &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2016/09/28/ansible-tower-high-availability-maintenance"&gt;Ansible Tower High Availability maintenance&lt;/a&gt;, but in the mean time many things changed and that post is not up to date anymore, so I decided to create a new one that covers the same topic but for Ansible Tower 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Ansible Tower 3.1 we lost the distinction of Primary Ansible Tower and Secondary Ansible Tower.
That concept was related to the fact that the Secondary Ansible Towers were in a hot-standby mode.
Since Ansible Tower 3.1, we have active-active clustering and therefore all Ansible Towers in your cluster are always active and there is no distinction between them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ansible Tower in Vagrant</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/07/26/ansible-tower-in-vagrant</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_07_26_ansible_tower_in_vagrant.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/07/26/ansible-tower-in-vagrant</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of times during my job I found myself with the need of Ansible Tower testing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

The reason I created a 2Gb of RAM machine and I&amp;rsquo;ve not tried to shrink it further is because the Ansible Tower installation checks for 2Gb of RAM, and I wanted to create something easy.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure I could patch the installer to accept a 1Gb machine, but it&amp;rsquo;s not worth the effort to me. Also, in my usual usage of the computer I rarely go below 11Gb free memory, so I&amp;rsquo;m not too concerned in giving 2Gb to my VM.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AnsibleFest London 2017</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/06/23/ansiblefest-london-2017</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_06_23_ansiblefest_london_2017.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/06/23/ansiblefest-london-2017</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year, I decided to go to AnsibleFest.

In fact, up to version 3.0, Ansible Tower multi-node installation, only allowed a single machine to be &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; and the switch was not possible in an automated fashion, so if the primary Ansible Tower would have collapsed, an operator should have promoted one of the &lt;em&gt;secondary&lt;/em&gt; Ansible Tower to be &lt;em&gt;primary&lt;/em&gt; to be able to carry on the work.
With Ansible Tower 3.1 this is no longer the case, since all Ansible Tower machines are active all the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>libVirt on Hetzner</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/04/26/libvirt-on-hetzner</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_04_26_libvirt_on_hetzner.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/04/26/libvirt-on-hetzner</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After many years of using Hetzner as a server provider, and having rented from them multiple servers for many reasons, I decided to rent a server with 128Gb of RAM to do some tests with many (virtualized) machines on top of CentOS.&lt;/p&gt;

My guess is that Inventories are effectively among the most complex things in Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible Inventories are complex in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you have decided an Inventory model is hard to change it, in fact you would probably be required to touch all your Playbooks to make everything working again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is not a single way of doing Inventories&lt;/li&gt;

I think that the reasons to go to FOSDEM are different from the reasons of many other conferences, but equally valid.
The comparison with DevConf is obvious, due to the temporal closeness of the two events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that DevConf is more about enterprise grade software (or close to be), while FOSDEM is more about experimentations and community.
The causes for this are probably obvious if you consider that DevConf is mainly sponsored by Red Hat, while FOSDEM is completely community driven.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DevConf 2017</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2017/01/29/devconf-2017</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2017_01_29_devconf.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2017/01/29/devconf-2017</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is a special moment of the year, where in less than two weeks is possible to meet a huge amount of Open Source contributors in person.

&lt;p&gt;This leaves me very sceptical, since I think the default mode in Ansible should be DIY.
Since I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in this situation far to many times, I decided to write down all the reasons why you should avoid Ansible Galaxy in the majority of situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Ansible Galaxy often violates the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ansible way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
My interpretation of the &lt;em&gt;Ansible Way&lt;/em&gt;, is do not do adopt overkill solution (also known as the classic &amp;ldquo;Keep It Simple Stupid&amp;rdquo; principle).
Many times the Ansible Roles you can find in Ansible Galaxy are completely overkill because are created by people coming from the Puppet world (that has a completely different approach).
Modules that install for you and configure NTP or Java for any possible distribution (and sometimes even different OS) means that you substitute a couple of Tasks with hundreds of lines of code.
Often the majority of the code can be stripped because is not applicable to the specific environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speedup Ansible</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2016/12/01/speedup-ansible</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2016_12_01_speedup_ansible.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2016/12/01/speedup-ansible</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The single most frequent complain I hear about Ansible is about it&amp;rsquo;s slowness.
This is very common, but even more common among people that used to use Puppet.
There are many reasons why Ansible is slower than Puppet.
The three main reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linear execution&lt;/strong&gt;: Ansible will execute each operation in order and will not run many steps at the same time as Puppet does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSH Connection&lt;/strong&gt;: all Ansible commands will be issued from the control system to the controlled system via SSH. On the other hand, in Puppet, all commands will be issued locally on the controlled host by the Puppet agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host limitation&lt;/strong&gt;: since the Ansible Controller is involved with the process of applying changes to the controlled system, a limited number of systems can be changes at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those limits come out from design decisions that preferred a simpler Playbook writing and a safer execution rather than speed.
There are some things that can be done to increase the performances of Ansible:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Automating your infrastructure with Ansible</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2016_11_29_ansible</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2016_11_29_ansible</guid><description/></item><item><title>Learning Ansible 2 - Second Edition</title><link>https://fale.io/publication/learning_ansible_2</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/publication/learning_ansible.jpg"/><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/publication/learning_ansible_2</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible is an open source automation platform that assists organizations with tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and task automation.

&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about this exam is that the participant decides which flavor and version of Linux he wants to use for the test.
The reality is that the Linux flavor changes very little on the tasks, but it puts the test-taker in a more comfortable situation due to the OS familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the talk of &lt;strong&gt;Richard M Stallman&lt;/strong&gt; on licensing and patents.
I&amp;rsquo;ve really liked how the talk has been conducted by the speakers and I think the contents were great (you can probably find it available online and if I&amp;rsquo;ll find a link, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Stallman&amp;rsquo;s talk, I went to listen &lt;strong&gt;Langdon White&lt;/strong&gt; talk &lt;strong&gt;Re-thinking Linux Distributions&lt;/strong&gt;.

It really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I had the occasion of following multiple very interesting talks.
The only problem I&amp;rsquo;ve found with the FOSDEM organization is that too often there are multiple very interesting talks at the same time and you have to pick only one (unless you have ubiquity capabilities, but I don&amp;rsquo;t).
I think one of the most interesting talk of the day - at least for me - was the &lt;strong&gt;Lennart Pottering&lt;/strong&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>FOSDEM - day 0</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2016/01/29/fosdem-day-0</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2016_01_29_fosdem_day0.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2016/01/29/fosdem-day-0</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For years I wanted to attend some major FLOSS conferences, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the occasion since I&amp;rsquo;ve always had other things to do in the conferences dates.
This year, due to multiple causes and good planning, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to go to FOSDEM :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I like to do at all kind of events, but even more in big events, is to volunteer.
Volunteering, in my opinion, gives you big advantages, since you often can find very interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The AWS tools are approaching EPEL7</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2016/01/27/the-aws-tools-are-approaching-epel7</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2016_01_27_aws_tools_in_epel7.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2016/01/27/the-aws-tools-are-approaching-epel7</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve announced the &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2016/01/16/the-aws-tools-are-approaching-fedora"&gt;availability of AWS tools for Fedora&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to announce that today they are available in the EPEL7 repository as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux&lt;/strong&gt; (EPEL) repository is an RPM repository managed by the Fedora community that creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, including, but not limited to, &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&lt;/strong&gt; (RHEL), &lt;strong&gt;CentOS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Scientific Linux&lt;/strong&gt; (SL), and &lt;strong&gt;Oracle Linux&lt;/strong&gt; (OL).
As you can imagine, the &lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; stays for the version, so only the version 7.x of the named distributions will allow you to install those packages.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The AWS tools are approaching Fedora</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2016/01/16/the-aws-tools-are-approaching-fedora</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2016_01_16_aws_tools_in_fedora.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2016/01/16/the-aws-tools-are-approaching-fedora</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve worked toward bringing the Amazon Web Services tools in Fedora.
The three AWS tools that are coming in the next few days in Fedora are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;botocore&lt;/strong&gt;: a low level Python library to interact with Amazon Web Services APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;boto3&lt;/strong&gt;: a high level Python library to interact with Amazon Web Services APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;awscli&lt;/strong&gt;: a Command Line Interface to interact with Amazon Web Services APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botocore just landed in Fedora &lt;em&gt;updates&lt;/em&gt; repositories while boto3 and awscli will be pushed to the &lt;em&gt;updates&lt;/em&gt; repository tomorrow or Monday morning.
If you want to see them in the repo even sooner test them and give feedbacks, in this way Bodhi will allow those packages to be pushed to the stable repository if feedbacks are positive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Innotop 1.10.0-0.3</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2015/12/22/innotop-1_10_0-0_3</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2015_12_22_innotop_1.10.0-0.3.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2015/12/22/innotop-1_10_0-0_3</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Innotop is a tool that allows you to control the status of a MySQL/MariaDB database.
It is widely used since it shows the data with an interface very similar to the &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately it&amp;rsquo;s development has slowed down, but small changes do come regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest change this time (compared to the 1.10.0-0.2 version) is the addition of a patch that allows innotop to work properly with MariaDB 10.1 and 10.2 that has recently hit the Fedora 24 repositories.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fedora 23 release party</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2015/12/13/fedora-23-release-party</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2015_12_13_fedora23_release_party.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2015/12/13/fedora-23-release-party</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Few days ago, on November 23, we have had a Fedora 23 release party in Milan, as &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Release_Party_F23_Milan"&gt;we announced in the wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we did something different from the previous one (the Fedora 21 release party) because we tried to do it in Milan, while the previous time we did it in Cernusco sul Naviglio that is a city very close to Milan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people that participated at the event was below expectation, but probably this is not only caused by the more central location, but also the limited planning time we had due to the location that has been provided to us by StartMiUp, a coworking space.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>qBittorrent 3.3.1</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2015/12/08/qbittorrent-3_3_1</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2015_12_08_qbittorrent_3_3_1.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2015/12/08/qbittorrent-3_3_1</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve worked toward bringing qBittorrent 3.3.1 to Fedora and EL7.
Today I&amp;rsquo;ve requested the stable branch for Fedora 23 and in the next few days I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same for Fedora and EL7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I writing about it instead of just leaving the updates come to you with the classical &amp;ldquo;dnf update&amp;rdquo;? Simply because this is a huge and very interesting update.
The biggest change in this update has been the switch from Qt4 to Qt5.
It should be pretty stable since qBittorent has been able to compile against Qt5 for more than one year and Fedora already has a lot of Qt5 packages.
So why waiting for such a long period before switching Qt version in Fedora packages?
We decided to respect the upstream decision to wait, so we switched to the Qt5 dependency when they did it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fedora 23</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2015_11_23_fedora23</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2015_11_23_fedora23</guid><description/></item><item><title>FLOSS for companies, the public sector, and schools</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2015_10_24_floss</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2015_10_24_floss</guid><description/></item><item><title>Open Street Map</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2015_10_24_osm</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2015_10_24_osm</guid><description/></item><item><title>OpenStack Cloud Security</title><link>https://fale.io/publication/openstack_cloud_security</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/publication/openstack_cloud_security.jpg"/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/publication/openstack_cloud_security</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is a system that controls large pools of computing and networking resources, along with cloud storage, allowing its users to provision resources through a user-friendly interface.

This has huge benefits, and this is why so many companies are doing this.
Along with the advantages, this new way of doing IT has it&amp;rsquo;s criticality that the administrators have to know to prevent possible problems to happen.
A lot of books that speaks about cloud technology forget to start from the basics of cloud and very often skip these concepts.
This book does not, and I greatly appreciated it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Logjam attack</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-attack</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2015_05_20_logjam_attack.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-attack</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today it was published a new kind of downgrade attack against TLS: logjam.
The attack relies on the fact that for Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, a prime is necessary.
Many applications use a pre-generated prime to speed up the Diffie-Hellman process.
Using a pre-generated prime is not a security issue by itself, but it can become one if coupled with a server that accepts very short Diffie-Hellman keys such as the 512 bits ones (the maximum allowed for DHE_EXPORT).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Elettronica Libera</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2015/03/21/elettronica-libera</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2015_03_21_elettronica_libera.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2015/03/21/elettronica-libera</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today ViGLug organized the &amp;ldquo;Elettronica Libera&amp;rdquo; (free, as-speech, electronics) event in Settala.&lt;/p&gt;

This caused some problems mainly due to the fact that many MySQL clients are not MariaDB 10 ready.
An example of a MySQL client not yet ready for MariaDB 10 is Innotop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innotop is a widely used client for MySQL/MariaDB that shows you an interface similar to the “top” Unix command.
To solve this, I found a patch online and, after some testing, I’ve added it to the Fedora package.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Wireshark Field Guide by Robert J.

Against Ian&amp;rsquo;s preference, the result of the vote is that Debian will use systemd as the default PID1.
The result is a very narrow one since it was 4:4 with Upstart.

Together, those two exams allowed me to earn the CompTIA Linux+ certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not found the two exams too hard, and in fact, I passed both with a considerable margin.
Those two exams are multiple-choice kind of questions.
I would find a scenario-based exam more valuable since it would test actual capabilities.
Still, I understand that for basic knowledge, the multiple-choice option can be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>RESTful Web APIs by Leonard Richardson, Mike Amundsen, Sam Ruby (O'Reilly Media)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/05/28/restful-web-apis-by-leonard-richardson-mike-amundsen-sam-ruby-oreilly-media</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_05_28_book_restful_web_api.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/05/28/restful-web-apis-by-leonard-richardson-mike-amundsen-sam-ruby-oreilly-media</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The API are now becoming more used every day.

&lt;p&gt;This is a good thing, if you like to read because allows the author to put way more contents than if he had to put more images and it keeps the file size small (~23Mb).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Principles of Big Data: Preparing, Sharing, and Analyzing Complex Information by Jules J Berman (Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/05/14/principles-of-big-data-preparing-sharing-and-analyzing-complex-information-by-jules-j-berman-elsevier/morgan-kaufmann</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_05_14_book_principles_of_bigdata.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/05/14/principles-of-big-data-preparing-sharing-and-analyzing-complex-information-by-jules-j-berman-elsevier/morgan-kaufmann</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I usually do not comment the books layout, being more focused on the contents of a book instead of it&amp;rsquo;s layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I will start this review speaking about the layout of this book since it&amp;rsquo;s REALLY peculiar. The Introduction is written in a two-columns layout, very similar to the Science magazine layout. The book itself is written in a single column layout, still with a &amp;ldquo;Science like&amp;rdquo; look. What shocked me a little bit about this is the sense of &lt;em&gt;old scientific document&lt;/em&gt; that this book has. This is true until you read the first few pages. As soon as you do it, the sense of &lt;em&gt;old scientific document&lt;/em&gt; disappears quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Practical Anonymity, by Peter Loshin (Elsevier/Syngress)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/05/07/practical-anonymity-by-peter-loshin-elsevier/syngress</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_05_07_book_practical_anonimity.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/05/07/practical-anonymity-by-peter-loshin-elsevier/syngress</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The anonymity on the web is probably one of the most debated topics on the web.
Is possible to be completely anonymous? The short answer is no.
This book tries to help the read to improve its anonymity, staying is the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;, as the &amp;ldquo;Practical&amp;rdquo; world in the title suggests.
In this book you will not find anything that is too complex for an average user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this is good or bad, depends on you expectations. I&amp;rsquo;ve took this book the first time with really high expectations and I was really disappointed. When I took it for the second time, with different expectations, I did found the book pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CompTIA Security+ Training Kit (Exam SY0-301) by David Seidl, Mike Chapple, James Michael Stewart (Microsoft Press)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/30/comptia-security-training-kit-exam-sy0-301-by-david-seidl-mike-chapple-james-michael-stewart-microsoft-press</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_04_30_book_comptia_security_plus_training_kit.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/30/comptia-security-training-kit-exam-sy0-301-by-david-seidl-mike-chapple-james-michael-stewart-microsoft-press</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After few months after the review of &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/08/comptia-security-rapid-review-exam-sy0-301-by-michael-gregg-microsoft-press"&gt;CompTIA Security+ Rapid Review&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m now here to speak about it&amp;rsquo;s bigger brother: the Training kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its 569 pages, this book is more than twice the length of the Rapid Review one. Even if someone can think that they did a better summary in the Rapid Review one, I have to say that this is not the case for these two books. While the Rapid Review allows you to pass the exam if you already know the certification contents and you only need to evaluate your level and to refresh some contents, the Training Kit will teach you the certification contents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide by Tom White (O'Reilly Media)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/23/hadoop-the-definitive-guide-by-tom-white-oreilly-media</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_04_23_book_hadoop_definitive_guide.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/23/hadoop-the-definitive-guide-by-tom-white-oreilly-media</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hadoop is today a industry-standard software for the Big Data and this book it&amp;rsquo;s the industry-standard book for Hadoop.
his book is able to bring you from no knowledge about Hadoop and the Big Data to a full knowledge of Hadoop and it&amp;rsquo;s usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is split in 16 chapters and 3 appendix for a total of 628 pages of contents. This make ~33 pages for chapter so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to read and to find what you need. This is very important since - even if it&amp;rsquo;s possible - it&amp;rsquo;s rare that this kind of book is read cover-to-cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hacking Web Apps by Mike Shema (Elsevier/Syngress)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/16/hacking-web-apps-by-mike-shema-elsevier/syngress</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_04_16_book_hacking_web_apps.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/16/hacking-web-apps-by-mike-shema-elsevier/syngress</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Mike Shema speaks about a lot of different kind of attacks in his book in a real deep way, at the point that sometimes I wondered if he was planning to instruct people how to hack websites or only how to secure own websites. The book has often some code samples that allow a faster understanding of what the author is saying. Even if a coding knowledge is not required, the ability to understand HTML, JS, SQL, PHP, Python and C++ speeds up the reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Logging and Log Management by Anton Chuvakin, Kevin Schmidt, Chris Phillips (Elsevier/Syngress)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/09/logging-and-log-management-by-anton-chuvakin-kevin-schmidt-chris-phillips-elsevier/syngress</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_04_09_book_logging_and_log_management.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/09/logging-and-log-management-by-anton-chuvakin-kevin-schmidt-chris-phillips-elsevier/syngress</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Logs are one of the most powerful tools in the sysadmin hands, and probably of all kind of IT roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book does deep into the logs and their management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects that I really liked about this book is the division of the text in chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; 420 pages long, but is well split in 22 chapter, so they are (on average) 21 pages long. This is a huge advantage, since it allows the reader to stop frequently without dividing a concept in two different reading sessions. Also, this policy, allows the reader to quickly find what is more important for her in that specific moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>HTML5 Canvas for Developers by David Geary (O'Reilly Media)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/02/html5-canvas-for-developers-by-david-geary-oreilly-media</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_04_02_video_html5_canvas_for_developers.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/04/02/html5-canvas-for-developers-by-david-geary-oreilly-media</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, this set of videos is for developers.
HTML 4 and Javascript are often used without much explaination about the JS code it self but only about the HTML5 Canvas part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt to point this out immediately since I&amp;rsquo;ve not found it on the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly page, but I believe that is really important to specify.
Another thing that I&amp;rsquo;d like to point out is that (as it is easy to imagine, but not obvious) these videos only speak about 2D graphics in HTML (therefore there will no WebGL topics).
After these two notes (that will not influence in any way my judgement about the videos), let&amp;rsquo;s start talking about the videos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Monitoring with Ganglia by Matt Massie, Bernard Li, Brad Nicholes, Vladimir Vuksan, Robert Alexander, Jeff Buchbinder, Frederiko Costa, Alex Dean, Dave Josephsen, Peter Phaal, Daniel Pocock (O'Reilly Media)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/26/monitoring-with-ganglia-by-matt-massie-bernard-li-brad-nicholes-vladimir-vuksan-robert-alexander-jeff-buchbinder-frederiko-costa-alex-dean-dave-josephsen-peter-phaal-daniel-pocock-oreilly-media</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_03_26_book_monitor_with_ganglia.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/26/monitoring-with-ganglia-by-matt-massie-bernard-li-brad-nicholes-vladimir-vuksan-robert-alexander-jeff-buchbinder-frederiko-costa-alex-dean-dave-josephsen-peter-phaal-daniel-pocock-oreilly-media</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ganglia is the most robust and scalable tool for performance monitor I&amp;rsquo;ve tried or heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, written by some of the top contributor of the project, is an awesome guide to Ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its organization and the authors writing style, the book is easy to understand and can be read as a &amp;ldquo;full-guide&amp;rdquo; reading it from the first page to the last one, or a reference book reading only the parts that are relevant to you in that specific moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Wireless Reconnaissance in Penetration Testing by Matthew Neely, Alex Hamerstone, Chris Sanyk (Elsevier/Syngress)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/19/wireless-reconnaissance-in-penetration-testing-by-matthew-neely-alex-hamerstone-chris-sanyk-elsevier/syngress</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_03_19_book_wireless_reconnaissance_in_penetration_testing.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/19/wireless-reconnaissance-in-penetration-testing-by-matthew-neely-alex-hamerstone-chris-sanyk-elsevier/syngress</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When someone says the word &amp;ldquo;wireless&amp;rdquo;, 99.9% of the audience thinks at the Wireless Networking Technologies (802.11 family).
Very few think to the Bluetooth.
Even fewer people think to all the other technologies that use wireless technology to work, such as cordless phone, guard radios, headsets, wireless camera etc.
This book embrace the last point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter provides basic information and motivation for Wireless Profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter 2 provides the reader with all the information she needs to be able to understand the wireless technology and it&amp;rsquo;s usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Metasploit by Mati Aharoni, Devon Kearns, Jim O'Gorman, David Kennedy (No Starch Press)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/12/metasploit-by-mati-aharoni-devon-kearns-jim-ogorman-david-kennedy-no-starch-press</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_03_12_book_metasploit.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/12/metasploit-by-mati-aharoni-devon-kearns-jim-ogorman-david-kennedy-no-starch-press</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Metasploit is the most common and complete framework for testing security.
Metasploit is an entire suite of tools and methodologies designed for testing the security of computers and networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is written for both experienced penetration tester and people new to the security field. For the first group, one of the most interesting thing is the explanation of the rules and ideas that formed the Penetration Test Execution Standard, while for users new to the field, is really interesting what can be done and how.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CompTIA A+ Rapid Review (Exam 220-801 and Exam 220-802) by Darril Gibson (Microsoft Press)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/05/comptia-a-rapid-review-exam-220-801-and-exam-220-802-by-darril-gibson-microsoft-press</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_03_05_book_comptia_a_plus_rapid_review.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/03/05/comptia-a-rapid-review-exam-220-801-and-exam-220-802-by-darril-gibson-microsoft-press</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/15/comptia-a-training-kit-exam-220-801-and-exam-220-802-by-darril-gibson-microsoft-press"&gt;CompTIA A+ Training Kit&lt;/a&gt;, here I am reviewing the Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s A+ Rapid Review.
This book is really similar to the book &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/08/comptia-security-rapid-review-exam-sy0-301-by-michael-gregg-microsoft-press"&gt;CompTIA Security+ Rapid Review&lt;/a&gt; (this too by Microsoft Press).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darril Gibson, the book&amp;rsquo;s author, have compressed a huge amount of contents in a (relatively) small amount of pages (411). This is the first big difference in respect of the Security+ Rapid Review, since this book has more contents per page (and about the double of pages).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>An idea to fight spam</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/28/an-idea-to-fight-spam</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_02_28_an_idea_to_fight_spam.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/28/an-idea-to-fight-spam</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to give you an idea on how to implement a spam system that can reduce some kind of spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a company or a politician, that does not respect the usual privacy policy, continues to send e-mails even if the user already tried to unsubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-postulates"&gt;My postulates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The people who usually send this kind of e-mail are not very familiar with how e-mail work or how the privacy policy works. Obviously there is the case in which they are malicious, but I prefer to think that the biggest part of these people are in the first two cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These people probably will have issues removing a person from a mailing list, therefore they will tend not doing it, unless they have an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is really annoying sending an e-mail to 10 contacts and receive 8 mail-delivery-subsystem errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="my-approach"&gt;My approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach is dividable in two directions that have to be implemented as features from the e-mail provider:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Digital Capture After Dark by Philipp Scholz Rittermann, Amanda Quintenz-Fiedler (Rocky Nook)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/26/digital-capture-after-dark-by-philipp-scholz-rittermann-amanda-quintenz-fiedler-rocky-nook</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_02_26_book_digital_capture_after_dark.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/26/digital-capture-after-dark-by-philipp-scholz-rittermann-amanda-quintenz-fiedler-rocky-nook</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This book does cover one of the hardest topic that are present in digital photography.
In fact, the photographies in the dark are the are the ones which are more frequently bad looking.
The book provides with a big amount of techniques and tips covering equipment, the actual taking of the image, and post-production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these techniques and tips are easily found on photography specific magazines and articles, but a book grouping all these techniques is really good since it&amp;rsquo;s an organic and easy to found and read collection.
Also, unlike many articles, the book contains a lot of reasoning on the techniques so it&amp;rsquo;s not a mere how-to book.
Despite usually the author does provide this kind of enhancements over the how-to techniques, this is not always true, and - I think - this should be corrected/improved in the next version of the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Make: Technology on Your Time Volume 33</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/19/make-technology-on-your-time-volume-33</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_02_19_book_make_33.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/19/make-technology-on-your-time-volume-33</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Make!

I think that this is a really cool number of Make.
As it usually happens to me, the part I like the most i the &amp;ldquo;Projects part&amp;rdquo;, in which I always find awesome ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article I liked the most is &amp;ldquo;Growing the Ghost&amp;rdquo; by Gabriel Nagmay.
This article speaks about the growing of the Bhut Jolokia, one of the world most powerful chili flavour.

When I downloaded it, it was a 140 Mb so I thought it was full of drawings and comics. As soon as I opened the file I saw it was nothing I thought it would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is mainly written (it can seem tautological  but I think that&amp;rsquo;s right to point it out) with a lot of photos. I think the reason of the &amp;ldquo;hugeness&amp;rdquo; of the file is given by the photos. Speaking of them, I think that some of them are really useful to understand the concepts that are being explained in the text, while others can be removed without removing any value from the book.
Speaking of the authors, it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting to spend a few words on their biography. James H. Carrott is really interested in history, while Brian David Johnson is a futurist at Intel. Two people with such a different background have been able to create a very high-level book.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Designing Games - A Guide to Engineering Experiences by Tynan Sylvester (O'Reilly Media)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/05/designing-games-a-guide-to-engineering-experiences-by-tynan-sylvester-oreilly-media</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_02_05_book_designing_games.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/02/05/designing-games-a-guide-to-engineering-experiences-by-tynan-sylvester-oreilly-media</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I read the first lines of the description &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ready to give your design skills a real boost?

As the title may suggest, this book is tailored to the preparation of the Microsoft 70-413 exam.
Speaking of the exam, I have to advice that the book does cover any exam objective, but does not cover every exam question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is split into an introduction, 5 chapters and the index.
The first chapter helps to understand how to plan and deploy a server infrastructure. The other four are focused on the designing and implementation of the various components: network infrastructure services (chapter 2), network access services (chapter 3), Active Directory logical infrastructure (chapter 4) and Active Directory physical infrastructure (chapter 5).
A thing I liked about this book is the presence of questions (with detailed answers).
What is improvable for these question is the number.
I think they should put way more questions.
So, the questions, are a good idea not well implemented.
The only thing I hoped to see on this book but is missing is the emphasis on the security.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Starting a Business Learn What You Need in Two Hours By Scott L. Girard Jr., Michael F. O'Keefe, Marc A. Price (Nova Vista Publishing)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/22/starting-a-business-learn-what-you-need-in-two-hours-by-scott-l-girard-jr-michael-f-okeefe-marc-a-price-nova-vista-publishing</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_01_22_book_starting_a_business.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/22/starting-a-business-learn-what-you-need-in-two-hours-by-scott-l-girard-jr-michael-f-okeefe-marc-a-price-nova-vista-publishing</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this book I had no idea about what I was going to find inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, the book is pretty short (the PDF version count 161 pages) and so it&amp;rsquo;s really a few reading hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided in 5 chapters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning&lt;/strong&gt;: this chapter covers the Business Plan and all the accessories planning. From my experience (and the author too) a good plan is mandatory if you don&amp;rsquo;t want see your great idea failing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Financed&lt;/strong&gt;: this short chapter (only 12 pages long) gives you some information and advice about the financial part of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started&lt;/strong&gt;: here you can find a lot of good advice and general information about marketing, patenting, copyright and other important things you should know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying alive&lt;/strong&gt;: here you&amp;rsquo;ll find information and advice on taxes, press releases and other things that will keep your company going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When tomorrow becomes today&lt;/strong&gt;: in this short chapter (only 5 pages long) are highlighted some differences between ordinary business and web business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is written with no specific sector in mind. This book can be read and found useful to a person that wants to open a pub or a person that wants to open an IT start-up. If this is good because anyone will find something for him, is bad because no one will find all information she needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CompTIA A+ Training Kit (Exam 220-801 and Exam 220-802) By Darril Gibson (Microsoft Press)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/15/comptia-a-training-kit-exam-220-801-and-exam-220-802-by-darril-gibson-microsoft-press</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_01_15_book_comptia_a_plus_training_kit.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/15/comptia-a-training-kit-exam-220-801-and-exam-220-802-by-darril-gibson-microsoft-press</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Reading this book has helped me a lot understanding better how the A+ exam works. This book is tailored for the CompTIA A+ certification (and this led me to this book instead of another one, since I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to take this certification).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the fact that every chapter does cover conclusively an argument. In this way, you can choose which arguments read based on your interests and your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CompTIA Security+ Rapid Review (Exam SY0-301) by Michael Gregg (Microsoft Press)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/08/comptia-security-rapid-review-exam-sy0-301-by-michael-gregg-microsoft-press</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_01_08_book_comptia_security_plus_rapid_review.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/08/comptia-security-rapid-review-exam-sy0-301-by-michael-gregg-microsoft-press</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This book is pretty short (258 pages long) but is very dense. It is divided into 6 chapters + one appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each atomic argument, the author does propose 1 to 3 True-or-False questions, their answer and the explanation. I did like the question-answer approach, since you understand immediately which is your level, therefore you can understand which parts you have to cover more and which less. What I did not liked at all about this structure is the layout. Every question is answered right below the question itself. I think this is a very bad approach, since is really hard to answer to a True-or-False question without looking at the answer that you know is there. I think they should have putted all the chapter questions and after all the chapter answers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to send an e-mail with attachment from the command line</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/03/how-to-send-an-e-mail-with-attachment-from-the-command-line</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_01_03_how_to_send_an_email_with_attachment_from_cli.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/03/how-to-send-an-e-mail-with-attachment-from-the-command-line</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to develop a script in UNIX that has to send an email?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have, probably you have used the &amp;ldquo;mail&amp;rdquo; function since this program is the standard program to send e-mails in UNIX environments if you are using the CLI (Command Line Interface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual for mail reports this as mail usage prototype:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;mail -r &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;sender&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; -s &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;subject&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; receiver-1&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;,receiver-2,...,receiver-n&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;File with the body&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think all the parameters are pretty straightforward except the &amp;ldquo;File with the body&amp;rdquo; one. This has to be an ASCII file (ie: .txt) with the e-mail body content in the text-only mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CompTIA Network+ Training Kit (Exam N10-005) by Craig Zacker (Microsoft Press)</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/01/comptia-network-training-kit-exam-n10-005-by-craig-zacker-microsoft-press</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2013_01_01_book_comptia_network_plus_training_kit.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2013/01/01/comptia-network-training-kit-exam-n10-005-by-craig-zacker-microsoft-press</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Reading this book has helped me a lot understanding better how the networking works.
This book is tailored for the CompTIA Network+ certification (and this led me to this book instead of another one, since I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to take this certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the &amp;ldquo;structureness&amp;rdquo; of this book.
After a brief introduction (Chapter 1) the book author analyzes the whole networking stack starting from ground up. The first chapters, in fact, are about Physical layer (Chapter 2), Data-Link Layer (Chapter 4) and Network Layer (Chapter 6). Then we find the Transportation Layer (Chapter 8) and the Application Layer (Chapter 9). We also find some really interested chapters like Network Devices (Chapter 3), Wireless Networking (Chapter 5), Network Security (Chapter 11) and Network Management (Chapter 12).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Strata Conference New York + Hadoop World 2012: Complete Video Compilation by O'Reilly Media, Inc.</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/12/28/strata-conference-new-york--hadoop-world-2012-complete-video-compilation-by-oreilly-media-inc</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_12_28_video_strata_conference.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/12/28/strata-conference-new-york--hadoop-world-2012-complete-video-compilation-by-oreilly-media-inc</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;ve been selected to review, I was shocked by the amount of material that is hidden in this product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more than 100 hours of videos of the Strata and Hadoop World conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material is divided in three sections: Keynotes (14 videos), Tutorials (64 videos) and Sessions (81 videos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Keynotes are really short video (7~15 minutes each) that tend to be some sort of advertise of the companies that are sponsors (I guess) of the event.
This is nice, but I would not waste time on these, if a person has really small amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exam Ref 70-410: Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012 by Craig Zacker, Microsoft Press</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/12/21/exam-ref-70-410-installing-and-configuring-windows-server-2012-by-craig-zacker-microsoft-press</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_12_21_book_windows_server_2012.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/12/21/exam-ref-70-410-installing-and-configuring-windows-server-2012-by-craig-zacker-microsoft-press</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This in not an O&amp;rsquo;Reilly book, even if you have found it on the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly website.
In fact this book has been published by the Microsoft Press.
Maybe this is a good thing, since we are talking about Windows Server, one of the main Microsoft products.
Who can speak about Windows better than its creator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title may suggest, this book is tailored to the preparation of the Microsoft 70-410 exam.
On the exam topic, I have to advice that the book does cover any exam objective, but does not cover every exam question.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Open Street Map</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2012_10_27_osm</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2012_10_27_osm</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wikimedia Foundation</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2012_10_27_wikimedia</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2012_10_27_wikimedia</guid><description/></item><item><title>SCO filed for liquidation</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/08/10/sco-filed-for-liquidation</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_08_10_sco_filed_for_liquidation.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/08/10/sco-filed-for-liquidation</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned in a &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2010/06/18/sco-v.-novell/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, the SCO economic situation is not one of the best ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After close to 10 years from SCO litigious policy against all UNIX companies and having already declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they have filled for Chapter 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 is that Chapter 11 is a situation where the management is still confident that the company can survive after restructuring and reorganization.
Chapter 11, on the other hand, is filled when the management believes there is no way the company can survive and will therefore initiate the liquidation process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>20 Recipes for Programming PhoneGap by Jamie Munro, O'Reilly</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/05/19/20-recipes-for-programming-phonegap-by-jamie-munro-oreilly</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_05_19_book_recipes_for_programming_phonegap.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 19 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/05/19/20-recipes-for-programming-phonegap-by-jamie-munro-oreilly</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This book starts with a little introduction and with the instructions to setup the environment.
After this, the book starts at full speed with &amp;ldquo;the Recipes&amp;rdquo;.
The structure based on Recipes is what I liked the of this book.
Every Recipe has the structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a very powerful structure because in this way we can learn from the obstacles that each one of us can encounter in his way while coding.
Also, this structure, gives to the reader the choice of what read when.
In fact, is possible to read this book from the first page to the last or to pick the single arguments that are useful to him in that precise moment.
Another thing that I really liked about this book is the fact that Jamie Munro uses in the same time PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile so you can learn two libraries in the same time and you can learn immediately to write an application that is nice to see and use.
I really liked this book and I would suggest this book to everyone is interested in using the PhoneGap framework to develop Mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Code Simplicity by Max Kanat-Alexander, O'Reilly</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/24/code-simplicity-by-max-kanat-alexander-oreilly</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_04_24_book_code_simplicity.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/24/code-simplicity-by-max-kanat-alexander-oreilly</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is not the typical O&amp;rsquo;Reilly programming book and you can find it out very easily when you have the book in your hands, since it does not have any code inside
The author, in fact, tries to create a &lt;em&gt;software development science&lt;/em&gt;.
This left me very puzzled since:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this kind of stuff has to be said by people after you, not buy the author himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author mainly collect ideas and principles that are already explained in a lot of other books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author suggests the DRY and the &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t fix if it isn&amp;rsquo;t broken&lt;/em&gt; principles and I think these will not always bring you to good code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book only says what to do, it does not cover how to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-factoring and single responsibility principle are not covered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart of these five points, I think that the book has reasons to live.
It is a really fast and superficial presentation of the subject.
I think it would be appropriate for students who are approaching for the first time the subject or for people that for working reasons have to deal with the subject but not in first person (like a project manager).
I would not suggest this book to people with real world programming experience or necessity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Linux Pocket Guide by Daniel J.

Probably is the most favorite one.
In the last years I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a book that was like a printed &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with some more explanation and a rigid order.
This book does all this plus something more (that I&amp;rsquo;d rather not having).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the professional to professional user, since otherwise it would be much bigger and boring for pro users.
I&amp;rsquo;ve to say that thanks to this the book is really small.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>jQuery UI by Eric Sarrion, O'Reilly</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/17/jquery-ui-by-eric-sarrion-oreilly</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_04_17_book_jquery_ui.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/17/jquery-ui-by-eric-sarrion-oreilly</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;jQuery has very interested me in the last period.
I think that it is the best JavaScript library for me.
jQuery UI is a set of functions that allow you to improve the graphics and the functionality of your websites with very few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My jQuery level was pretty close before I took the time to read this book.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found this book amazing and really interesting even for fast-learner as I am (knowing a dozen of languages and libraries I tend to go really fast when I&amp;rsquo;m studying a new language or library).
I think this book is mainly for beginner or intermediate users since it focuses the reader on the main parts of jQuery UI leaving aside some real-world and advanced coding details that may be crucial in the real world development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mobile Design Pattern Gallery by Theresa Neil, O'Reilly</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/09/mobile-design-pattern-gallery-by-theresa-neil-oreilly</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_04_09_book_mobile_design_pattern_gallery.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/09/mobile-design-pattern-gallery-by-theresa-neil-oreilly</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This book is weird, I&amp;rsquo;ve to tell you.
I was expecting a book with some examples and some text.
Well, I ended up with a book that, at the first sight, seems more a book for kids rather than a professional book since is 90% images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is clearly organized, each chapter covering one specific aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search, sorting and filters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invitations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback &amp;amp; Affordance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anti-patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little while, I learned how to learn (a lot of) good patterns and bad patterns (anti-patterns) from this book.
The downside of the approach the author kept is that all the arguments are not deeply analysed, while the main information are given.
For each topic, Neil shows some patterns pointing out for each one a good use of it and the possible risks using it.
The last chapter (the one about the anti-patterns) is, in my opinion, the most useful.
Here some anti-patterns are analysed pointing out why they are anti-patterns and how to improve them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Art of SEO by Eric Enge, Stephan Spencer, Jessie Stricchiolla and Rank Fishkin, O'Reilly</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/04/the-art-of-seo-by-eric-enge-stephan-spencer-jessie-stricchiolla-and-rank-fishkin-oreilly</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_04_04_book_the_art_of_seo.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/04/the-art-of-seo-by-eric-enge-stephan-spencer-jessie-stricchiolla-and-rank-fishkin-oreilly</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since the four authors are very popular in the SEO field, I was expecting the best book on SEO ever. All my expectation have been met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the book authors have done a great job describing these difficult concept in an easy and ordered way.
The book, also, is very complete.
The touched topics include: user-focussed data, key analytical tools, effective website creation, result tracking, search engine theory and behaviour, the impact of social media, SEO best practices and much more.
Sometimes the authors deviate from the topics usually covered in SEO books, in fact you can find topics like In-house vs outsourced SEO.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>jQuery Mobile: Up and Running by Maximiliano Firtman, O'Reilly</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/01/jquery-mobile-up-and-running-by-maximiliano-firtman-oreilly</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_04_01_book_jquery_mobile_up_and_running.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/04/01/jquery-mobile-up-and-running-by-maximiliano-firtman-oreilly</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;jQuery Mobile is a library that allows you to develop mobile apps using jQuery.
Is even possible to use a jQuery Mobile program as a native app, thanks to programs like PhoneGap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book assumes that you already know jQuery and I think that this is good since the author can focus only on the main topic in this way.
I think you should know or study jQuery before even starting this book.
I do know that&amp;rsquo;s possible to understand jQuery code even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything of JavaScript if you have rock solid programming knowledge, but I discourage it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mining the Social Web by Matthew Russell, O'Reilly</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2012/02/28/mining-the-social-web-by-matthew-russell-oreilly</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2012_02_28_book_mining_the_social_web.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2012/02/28/mining-the-social-web-by-matthew-russell-oreilly</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Mining the Social Web is a good start for anyone is going to create scripts to analyze patterns in Social Networks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve to say that this book consider that the reader already masters &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;.
I think that should be written directly on the title (ie: &amp;ldquo;Mining the Social Web with Python&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the really fast approach to the Social Networks, even if a lot of times I wanted more; for this reason I consider it only a start, not a complete book.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Download.com bundles malware in downloads</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2011/12/06/download_com-bundles-malware-in-downloads</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2011_12_06_downloadcom_bundles_malware_in_downloads.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2011/12/06/download_com-bundles-malware-in-downloads</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Gordon Lyon (also known as Fyodor), the creator of Nmap, sent an email yesterday to the Nmap mailing list pointing out that the C|Net Download.com website is altering Nmap downloadable files injecting malware into them.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation GT218 [ION] (rev ff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is a nice Intel integrated card that allows you to have good performance in the 99.9% of the typical netbook user-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other hand, the Nvidia ION is way more powerful than the integrated Intel card.
ION is capable of running HD videos, full-screen Youtube HD videos, games, and much more.
The downside of the nVidia card is the power drain.
This version of ION does drain &lt;del&gt;600mA more than the Intel integrated card.
These 600mA, as you can imagine, need also to be dissipated, forcing the vent to spin at its maximum speed.
Even with the vent at the maximum speed, the temperature increases from the 40&lt;/del&gt;55°C (idle with ION deactivated) to 65~80° (idle with ION active).
Therefore I&amp;rsquo;ve created a script that keeps ION deactivated by default and allows the user to active it when is needed and stop it when is no more needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Brain Jumble</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2011/05/22/brain-jumble</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2011_05_22_brain_jumble.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2011/05/22/brain-jumble</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, the ViGLug organized an event in Settala called Brain Jumble.

With this assignment, there are no more IPV4 classes /8 available from IANA.
This does not mean that there are no IPv4 available, but that from now on, only smaller classes will be assignable.
Also, the RIR still has some /8 classes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people see this as a clear sign that the move to IPv6 is imminent.
I do not share this optimism.
For many years companies will continue freeing IPv4 classes by implementing NATs and will sell those classes to newer companies that will require IPv4s.
Over time the average price per address will increase, squeezing out of the market the small players.
We will see a move to IPv6 at a certain point, but I doubt it will happen before 10 or 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Open Source Licenses</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2010_10_23_licenses</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2010_10_23_licenses</guid><description/></item><item><title>Open Street Map</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2010_10_23_osm</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2010_10_23_osm</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wikimedia Foundation</title><link>https://fale.io/talk/2010_10_23_wikimedia</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/talk/2010_10_23_wikimedia</guid><description/></item><item><title>Python 2.7 released</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2010/07/05/python-2_7-released</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2010_07_05_python_27_released.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2010/07/05/python-2_7-released</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, with an email to the Python Announce mailing list, Benjamin Peterson announced the release of Python 2.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moment is of historical importance for the Python project since 2.7 will be the latest major 2.x release.
From now on, only the Python 3.x branch will have additional development.
To ease this change, Python 2.7 will get full support for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes between 2.7 and 3 are easy to apply for the majority of codebases, but I suspect that many projects will not make the deadline.
The main reason for my skepticism is that open-source projects have a horrible track record for those changes.
The main reason this happens is that many libraries, used usually by many other projects, are unmaintained or so lightly maintained that such an effort will be hardly doable.
Also, until the libraries get ported, there is no way the applications or other libraries that depend on them will be ported.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SCO v.

The history of SCO is a complex one, with many acquisitions, merges, and renames.
But, long story short, they affirmed to be the rightful owner of many aspects of UNIX.
SCO leveraged this supposed ownership and sued many companies such as AutoZone, DaimlerChrysler, IBM, and Novell to obtain royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of those litigations is given by the fact that if it is true that SCO is the owner of UNIX, this will imply that they are also the owner of Linux or at least some parts of it.
The fact that such a litigious company like SCO would be the owner of Linux would be a nightmare with a substantial impact on open source companies and communities to the point that Linux&amp;rsquo;s future would be in danger.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Microsoft just sent a huge patch to the Linux Kernel</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2009/07/26/microsoft-just-sent-a-huge-patch-to-the-linux-kernel</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2009_07_26_microsoft_has_sent_a_huge_patch_to_the_linux_kernel.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2009/07/26/microsoft-just-sent-a-huge-patch-to-the-linux-kernel</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a historical twist, now Microsoft contributes to Linux Kernel.
This fact can seem absurd, but Microsoft sent a 22k lines patch to better support Linux on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Hyper-V last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we have to remember that Steve Balmer, Microsoft CEO, back in 2001 affirmed compared Linux and Open Source to cancer.
On the other hand, it does make sense for Microsoft to ensure that Linux properly runs on Hyper-V, and there is no better way to do so than to commit the code themselves.
Also, Microsoft has entered into a deal with Novell for many millions of dollars around Linux and Windows interoperability in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Qt embraces LGPL</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2009/01/20/qt-embraces-lgpl</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2009_01_20_qt_embraces_lgpl.webp"/><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2009/01/20/qt-embraces-lgpl</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Sebastian Nyström (Vice President of Qt Software) announced that Qt would have one additional license from the next release: the LGPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge change from the previous Qt licensing policy and a good step in the path that Qt started many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall not forget that until 2000, Qt was released in a double Commercial/QPL license, and while the QPL name is Qt Public License, it was not considered Free Software by the Free Software Foundation.
In 2000, they added the GPL license to the mix, which solved all issues for the open-source community but still forced the non-open-source customer to buy from Qt Software.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google's Android 1</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2008/09/28/googles-android-1</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2008_09_28_googles_android_1.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2008/09/28/googles-android-1</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Google unveiled Android 1.0.

Or, at least, this is my read on the matter and the meaning I&amp;rsquo;m giving it in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference between Android and iOS is that Android will allow multiple companies to create competing Android devices.
On the one hand, this will create more options for the consumers; on the other hand, it will create a less coherent experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduction to KDE4</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2008/05/14/introduction-to-kde4</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2008_05_14_introduction_to_kde4.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2008/05/14/introduction-to-kde4</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about the &lt;a href="https://nblug.org"&gt;NBLUG&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://fale.io/blog/2007/09/12/nblug"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.

Actually, this is the first time I have gone to a Linux User Group event at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening started with a presentation by Kyle Rankin on how DNS works.
The presentation was very interesting because we use DNS so frequently in our lives, but it &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; for most people, and they have no idea how and why it works.
I think tech people must understand how those base technologies work since, a lot of time, an issue can be pinned to something at an underlying level.
In my experience, all abstractions in information technology are leaky abstractions.
Therefore it&amp;rsquo;s critical to understand the whole stack to understand behaviors at a certain stack level.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unfakable Linux</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2007/01/15/unfakable-linux</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2007_01_15_unfakable_linux.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2007/01/15/unfakable-linux</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in October, Oracle announced Unbreakable Linux, a re-packaged version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Red Hat quickly replied with a stunt playing on the similar sound between Unbreakable Linux and Unfakable Linux to point out that Unbreakable Linux is just a copy of RHEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons Oracle created their own distro are undoubtedly multiple, but I think the leading one is to provide their customers with a single vendor solution.
I think that the fact that Oracle decided to base their version on RHEL is the most sensible decision.
In fact, most of their customers are already using their products on RHEL.
RHEL is, therefore, already a very well-supported platform for Oracle products.
And, finally, RHEL is the leading Linux in the enterprise space.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Microsoft/Novell deal</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2006/11/04/microsoft/novell-deal</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2006_11_04_microsoft_novell_deal.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2006/11/04/microsoft/novell-deal</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd of November, Microsoft and Novell announced an agreement to share some patents, cross-marketing, and collaborative development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is very recent, and it is difficult to say what exactly it includes and what consequences (if any) it will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the information currently available, it seems there are multiple parts to the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both companies will work on the compatibility between their OSes and the other company&amp;rsquo;s virtualization solution (Windows on Xen and SLE on Viridian).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be a collaboration between the companies to improve the compatibility between OpenOffice.orf and the Open Office XML Format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Novell and Microsoft will provide each other&amp;rsquo;s customers with patent coverage for their respective products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft will officially recommend SuSE Linux Enterprise to their customers that will enquire about Linux options.&lt;/li&gt;

This is a major release of the office suite, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s also a major accomplishment for the project.
There are two main aspects I think make this release very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first aspect is the default use of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) to save files.
I believe that the future of office documents should be the ODF format, even if most probably it will not.
Currently, the de-facto standards are the Microsoft Office ones (doc, xls, ppt), but those are not official standards, and therefore interoperability is very hard if not impossible.
I hope that we will have official international standards for these kinds of files over time and that everyone will use them.
To achieve this goal, I see as an excellent first step this default setting in OpenOffice.org 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Debian Sarge</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2005/06/15/debian-sarge</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2005_06_15_debian_sarge.webp"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2005/06/15/debian-sarge</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, Debian Sarge become stable.

&lt;p&gt;Even if the version can make it feel like something already battle-tested, this is the first release of Ubuntu.
The 4.10 version indicates the year and month of release using the YY.MM schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Shuttleworth has sent the Ubuntu release announcement.
He became a millionaire by selling Thawte Consulting, a Certificate Authority that he founded in 1995, to Symantec in 1999.
His most famous achievement has probably been being the second paying space tourist and the first South African in space.
In the Linux space, Shuttleworth contributed to the Debian project in the 90s and created the Shuttleworth Foundation in 2001 to support social projects that are free and open source.

Novell is a public company from Provo, Utah, and the creator of NetWare.
Interestingly, IBM got involved in the deal paying $50 million of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m personally not sure if this is good or bad for the Linux space, but there are a few considerations that I&amp;rsquo;d like to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, the fact that IBM contributed to the deal means that there will probably be more collaboration between IBM and SUSE, and therefore SUSE might be able to gain traction.
Also, Novell has recently bought Ximian, another Linux company focusing on GNOME.
Those facts set Novell on a path to become a Microsoft competitor.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>C Course</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2003/12/21/c-course</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2003_12_21_c_course.webp"/><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2003/12/21/c-course</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of last school year, my Computer Science teacher asked the class if anyone would have been interested in a C Course.

So, at the beginning of October, we started the C lessons and this past week we had the last lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I only knew QBasic, so that is my term of comparison.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found C to be way more elegant, probably due to the usage of curvy parenthesis instead of &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NEXT&lt;/code&gt;, and similar keywords to delimit code blocks within cycles and control structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Code Book</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2003/06/14/the-code-book</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2003_06_14_the_code_book.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2003/06/14/the-code-book</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I got gifted &lt;em&gt;The Code Book&lt;/em&gt; by Simon Singh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is excellent.
It starts from very ancient forms of encryption and moves to current and even future encryption systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve personally read it in Italian, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it very easy to read and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book analyzes how the various encryption systems work, their security level and how they got defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating how many of the more recent systems got violated due to the humans involved in it.
It seems like modern encryption systems are more secure than humans, so it&amp;rsquo;s easier to compromise the humans involved in the process than the system itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Debian Woody</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2002/09/05/debian-woody</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2002_09_05_debian_woody.webp"/><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2002/09/05/debian-woody</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I found at the news shop a Linux magazine with the new Debian Woody CD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tried to install it the first time, it did not work correctly, like Debian 2.2.
Having looked more in-depth into this, I understood that the problem lay in the XFree86 configuration that did not work correctly on my setup.
With many attempts and few changes, it does now work enough to make the system usable.
3D acceleration is still not available, but at least the 2D part works!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mandrake</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2002/01/07/mandrake</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2002_01_07_mandrake.webp"/><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2002 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2002/01/07/mandrake</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Christmas holidays are coming to an end, but I&amp;rsquo;m very happy because - after many attempts - I was able to install Mandrake Linux 8.1 on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to install Debian 2.2 as well, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not been able to make XFree86 work properly with my video card, so all the graphical applications are not able to start.
I would really like to successfully install Debian &amp;ldquo;minimal&amp;rdquo;, since I have the feeling that Mandrake is bloated.
Rightly after the installation was completed, I already had tens of applications installed.
I appreciate that this is helpful in same cases, but I would prefer to have a minimalistic Operating System installed and then add the stuff I want to use on top.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Linux</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2001/10/19/linux</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2001_10_19_linux.webp"/><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2001/10/19/linux</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, an ex-student was back at my school during a non-mandatory laboratory that occurs every Friday. He was speaking about what he does in high school he is attending.
The topic was about the IT subjects and how they are handled in that specific high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lecture, the ex-student stuck around to speak with the professor since the ex-student was trying to convince the teacher to ditch Windows and its licenses to move to a different OS, which was better and free.
The teacher was not very convinced on the idea since, even if there was an obvious economic advantage in the choice, the teacher believed that it was not easy to use and that it would not have taught the students to use Windows, which is what is required by today and tomorrow people.
After the conversation with the teacher, I approached the ex-student to learn more about this unusual operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First post</title><link>https://fale.io/blog/2000/11/04/first-post</link><media:content type="image/webp" medium="image" width="728" height="350" url="https://fale.io/img/posts/2000_11_04_first_post.webp"/><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2000 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/blog/2000/11/04/first-post</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought multiple times to create a blog in the last few months but never did it.
Now that moment arrived, and here it is!
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to commit to a posting schedule, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to update it frequently.
I have a strong interest in Information Technology, so that will probably be the main topic of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://fale.io/about</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fale.io/about</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about building open, innovative solutions that empower businesses and communities.
