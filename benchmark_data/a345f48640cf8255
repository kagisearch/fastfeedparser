					<description><![CDATA[<p>Guys of a certain vintage have a favorite bragging rights contest. It begins with, “We had it really bad when I was young,” followed by gritty, liberally embellished details of some near apocalypse in early life. The finishing touch is a smug, dismissive comment about the weak-pulse and sedentary lives of “young people these days.” [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Next year, the United States will celebrate its Semiquincentennial, or 250th anniversary. Per Wikipedia, other names under which this occasion is being heralded include “Bisesquicentennial,” “Sestercentennial,” “Quarter Millennium,” and—inspired, no doubt, by the advertising and marketing fads of late capitalism—the banal “America250,” which sounds more like a software suite than a memorial.

In the first nine stories in The Innocence of Father Brown, the priest discussed reason, redemption, pride, humility, and the presence of evil.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s a sad state of society that in the last 25 years our TVs have gotten thinner while most of us viewers have gotten fatter. Even worse, the empty calories dished up in the programming streaming into homes these days do nothing to nourish the mind. With hundreds of reality shows and Hallmark Christmas movies [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Why is G.K. Chesterton so prophetic? I would meekly suggest that it is because in his own age he never submitted to the Spirit of the Age. He is never swept away by fads and fashions. Rather, he recognizes and ridicules them. He always keeps his eternal perspective. By focusing on the timeless truths, he [&#8230;]</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>J.R.R. Tolkien and G.K. Chesterton, two giants of the 20th century literary scene, might even be considered as a pair of patron saints for Catholic writers. It is all the more fitting, then, to discover that Tolkien knew Chesterton’s work well—in fact, his daughter Priscilla said he was “steeped in it”—and delighted in it. Chesterton [&#8230;]</p>
