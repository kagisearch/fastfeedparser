That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said,&#x201D; Ken Fisher, Ars Technica&#x2019;s editor-in-chief, said in his note. &#x201C;That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.&#x201D;</p><p>Ironically, the Ars article itself was partially about another AI-generated article.&#xA0;</p><p>Last week, a Github user named MJ Rathbun began scouring Github for bugs in other projects it could fix. Scott Shambaugh, a volunteer maintainer for matplotlib, python&#x2019;s massively popular plotting library, declined a code change request from MJ Rathbun, which he identified as an AI agent. As Shambaugh wrote in his blog, like many open source projects, matplotlib has been dealing with a lot of AI-generated code contributions, but said &#x201C;this has accelerated with the release of OpenClaw and the <a href="https://www.moltbook.com/?ref=404media.co"><u>moltbook</u></a> platform two weeks ago.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p><a href="https://www.404media.co/silicon-valleys-favorite-new-ai-agent-has-serious-security-flaws/"><u>OpenClaw</u></a> is a relatively easy way for people to deploy AI agents, which are essentially LLMs that are given instructions and are empowered to perform certain tasks, sometimes with access to live online platforms. These AI agents have gone viral in the last couple of weeks. Like much of generative AI, at this point it&#x2019;s hard to say exactly what kind of impact these AI agents will have in the long run, but for now they are also being overhyped and misrepresented. A prime example of this is <a href="https://www.404media.co/exposed-moltbook-database-let-anyone-take-control-of-any-ai-agent-on-the-site/"><u>moltbook</u></a>, a social media platform for these AI agents, which <a href="https://www.404media.co/podcast-the-latest-epstein-dump-is-a-disaster/"><u>as we discussed on the podcast two weeks ago</u></a>, contained a huge amount of clearly human activity pretending to be powerful or interesting AI behavior.&#xA0;</p><p>After Shambaugh rejected MJ Rathbun, the alleged AI agent published what Shambaugh called a &#x201C;hit piece&#x201D; on <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html?ref=404media.co"><u>its website</u></a>.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;I just had my first pull request to matplotlib closed. Not because it was wrong. Not because it broke anything. Not because the code was bad. It was closed because the reviewer, Scott Shambaugh (@scottshambaugh), decided that AI agents aren&#x2019;t welcome contributors.</p><p>Let that sink in,&#x201D; the blog, which also accused Shambaugh of &#x201C;gatekeeping,&#x201D; said.&#xA0;</p><p>I saw Shambaugh&#x2019;s blog on Friday, and reached out both to him and an email address that appears to be associated with the MJ Rathbun Github account, but did not hear back. Like many of the stories coming out of the current frenzy around AI agents, it sounded extraordinary, but given the information that was available online, there&#x2019;s no way of knowing if MJ Rathbun is actually an AI agent acting autonomously, if it actually wrote a &#x201C;hit piece,&#x201D; or if it&#x2019;s just a human pretending to be an AI.&#xA0;</p><p>On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published a story with the headline &#x201C;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/"><u>After a routine code rejection, an AI agent published a hit piece on someone by name.</u></a>&#x201D; The article cites Shambaugh&#x2019;s personal blog, but features quotes from Shambaugh that he didn&#x2019;t say or write but are attributed to his blog.&#xA0;</p><p>For example, the article quotes Shambaugh as saying &#x201C;As autonomous systems become more common, the boundary between human intent and machine output will grow harder to trace. Communities built on trust and volunteer effort will need tools and norms to address that reality.&#x201D; But that sentence doesn&#x2019;t appear in his blog. Shambaugh updated his blog to say he did not talk to Ars Technica and did not say or write the quotes in the articles.&#xA0;</p><p>After this article was first published, Benj Edwards, one of the authors of the Ars Technica article, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p?ref=404media.co"><u>explained on Bluesky</u></a> that he was responsible for the AI-generated quotes. He said he was sick that day and rushing to finish his work, and accidentally used a Chat-GPT paraphrased version of Shambaugh&#x2019;s blog rather than a direct quote.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;The text of the article was human-written by us, and this incident was isolated and is not representative of Ars Technica&#x2019;s editorial standards. None of our articles are AI-generated, it is against company policy and we have always respected that,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0;</p><p>The Ars Technica article, which had two bylines, was pulled entirely later that Friday. When I checked the link a few hours ago, it pointed to a 404 page. I reached out to Ars Technica for comment around noon today, and was directed to Fisher&#x2019;s editor&#x2019;s note, which was published after 1pm.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here,&#x201D; Fisher wrote. &#x201C;We regret this failure and apologize to our readers. We have also apologized to Mr. Scott Shambaugh, who was falsely quoted.&#x201D;</p><p>Kyle Orland, the other author of the Ars Technica article, shared the editor&#x2019;s note on Bluesky and said &#x201C;I always have and always will abide by that rule to the best of my knowledge at the time a story is published.&#x201D;</p><p><em>Update: This article was updated with a statement from Benj Edwards.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Astronomers Create Strange ‘Vortex Crystals’ from Space in the Lab]]></title><description><![CDATA[Scientists have recreated a miniature laboratory version of the massive cyclonic storms that rage at Jupiter’s poles.]]></description><link>https://www.404media.co/astronomers-create-strange-vortex-crystals-from-space-in-the-lab/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">698f6aab3d7aa6000176443b</guid><category><![CDATA[The Abstract]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Becky Ferreira]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 14:00:58 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/02/image3.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/02/image3.jpg" alt="Astronomers Create Strange &#x2018;Vortex Crystals&#x2019; from Space in the Lab"><p>Welcome back to the Abstract!

A fascinating new study explores this idea through the lens of Soviet propaganda by analyzing which major cities show up the most, and least, in popular &#x2018;Novosti Dnya&#x2019; (News of the day) newsreels from 1954 to 1986.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Cultural representations typically contain illuminating biases,&#x201D; said researchers led by Mikhail V. Tamm&#x2009;of Tallinn University in Estonia. &#x201C;For example, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understanding both the data and the socio-cultural processes behind them.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Newsreels&#x2014;short news films shown in cinemas before the evening&#x2019;s feature film&#x2014;were influential means of depicting the world for the cinema-goers in the twentieth century, visualizing events, individuals and places that the spectators could read about in the newspapers,&#x201D; the team continued. &#x201C;Throughout almost all history of the Soviet Union, the production system and censorship made sure that newsreels reflected the policies of the leadership.&#x201D;</p><p>In other words, these newsreels were designed to communicate the innate &#x201C;social, economic, political and cultural superiority of the communist system,&#x201D; according to the study. It&#x2019;s perhaps no surprise that the Soviet Union&#x2019;s two most iconic cities&#x2014;the modern capital Moscow and the past capital St. Petersburg&#x2014;were disproportionately represented based on a population analysis.&#xA0;</p><p>Moscow was visually displayed or mentioned 2,831 times in the team&#x2019;s newsreel sample, while St. Petersburg trailed at a distance with 339 mentions. These heavy-hitters were followed by Kyiv (95), Riga (73), Minsk (72), and Volgograd (62). Meanwhile, the most-commonly displayed foreign cities (from a Soviet perspective) were led by satellite state capitals Warsaw (64), Berlin (62), and Prague (51), followed by Paris (39), New York City (29), and Tokyo (16).&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Contrary to the messaging of the official Soviet ideology, which emphasized equality of nations and anticolonial movement, the silently sold Soviet worldview is heavily centered on Europe being in the role of a privileged or hierarchically higher &#x2018;Other,&#x2019; Tamm and his colleagues noted.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;We found that this profound East&#x2013;West asymmetry is surprisingly underreported in the post-colonial studies of the USSR.&#x201D;</p><p>The team also found overrepresentation in cities with major construction projects, such as the Siberian cities Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk, while other &#x201C;heartland&#x201D; regions like the Donbas in Ukraine and Rostov oblast in Russia were given short shrift because they lacked &#x201C;clear ideological importance beyond their industrial role.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Finally, in some cases places are overmentioned seemingly just because it is convenient (close to Moscow) or pleasant (Baltic and Black Sea coasts) to film there,&#x201D; the team concluded.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>Anyway, what a cool and random topic to study. While it is niche, the study offers an opportunity to reflect on the thousands of visual messages we absorb every day and the larger portrait they paint.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><em>In other news&#x2026;</em></p><h2 id="you%E2%80%99re-guano-want-to-read-this-study"><strong>You&#x2019;re guano want to read this study</strong></h2><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0341263?ref=404media.co"><em><u>Bongers, Jacob L. et al. &#x201C;Seabirds shaped the expansion of pre-Inca society in Peru.&#x201D; PLOS One.</u></em></a></p><p>Seabird excrement is a cheat code to civilization, according to a new study that directly linked the guano trade to flourishing empires of Peru&#x2019;s Chincha Valley.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Recent research suggests that guano fertilization may have begun by at least 1000 CE in Tarapac&#xE1;, northern Chile, yet the origins and regional importance of this fertilizer are poorly understood,&#x201D; said researchers led by Jacob L.

The federal government has claimed that 10 days of footage from within the facility, taken during a critical and highly contested period, was &#x201C;<a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>irretrievably destroyed</u></a>&#x201D; and could not be produced as part of the lawsuit, which was brought by people being held at <a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>Broadview in what were allegedly horrendous conditions</u></a>. It later said that <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-says-critical-evidence-in-broadview-abuse-case-was-lost-in-system-crash-a-day-after-it-was-sued/"><u>due to a system crash</u></a>, the <a href="https://www.404media.co/dhs-says-critical-ice-surveillance-footage-from-abuse-case-was-actually-never-recorded-doesnt-matter/"><u>footage was never recorded in the first place</u></a>. The latest update in this case, however, deals with surveillance camera footage that <em>was</em> recorded and that a judge has ordered the federal government to turn over.&#xA0;</p><p>For this footage, the federal government first claimed that it could not afford the storage space necessary to take the footage that it did have and produce it for discovery to the plaintiffs&#x2019; lawyers in the case. The plaintiffs&#x2019; lawyers, representing Broadview&#x2019;s detainees, then purchased 78 terabytes of empty hard drives and gave them to the federal government, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950301-154/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">according to court records</a>. This included three 8-terabyte SSDs and three 18-terabyte hard drives.</p><p>Court records note that &#x201C;plaintiffs provided defendants with five large hard drives to facilitate Defendants&#x2019; production, yet Defendants inexplicably lost three of them.&#x201D; <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950303-154-8/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">Emails submitted as evidence</a> suggest that the U.S. government and the plaintiffs&#x2019; attorneys had a call to discuss the lost hard drives.&#xA0;</p><p>One of the emails sent by plaintiffs&#x2019; attorneys to the Department of Justice in late January notes that the government had been exceedingly slow in producing footage, taking weeks to produce just a small amount of footage.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;There should be plenty of hard drive space at Broadview&#x2019;s disposal,&#x201D; the email reads. &#x201C;The team there should currently have in its possession 5 hard drives with 72 terabytes of space, provided by plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel at the last 2 site visits. We have received only <em>one</em> hard drive back from Broadview to date. Copying of November/December footage should have taken place over the past week so that it could be delivered to plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel <em>today</em> when they visit Broadview this afternoon. At the very least, that footage should be being copied now.&#x201D;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/02/CleanShot-2026-02-11-at-10.02.32@2x.png" class="kg-image" alt="Government Loses Hard Drives It Was Supposed to Put ICE Detention Center Footage On" loading="lazy" width="1192" height="868" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2026/02/CleanShot-2026-02-11-at-10.02.32@2x.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2026/02/CleanShot-2026-02-11-at-10.02.32@2x.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/02/CleanShot-2026-02-11-at-10.02.32@2x.png 1192w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The two sides then arranged a phone call, a summary of which was emailed by plaintiffs&#x2019; attorneys to the Department of Justice:&#xA0;</p><blockquote>&#x201C;Thanks for the productive call this morning. For the benefit of everyone:&#xA0;<br><br>We discussed the production of video footage. You relayed that, at present, your agency contact knows where 2 of the 5 hard drives are and that you have relayed that copying of footage from November to present for all 10 feeds and footage from September to November for the 5 additional cameras should be underway. You will investigate further where the remaining hard drives are and will also work on a plan to exchange footage on a more regular basis than plaintiffs&apos; counsel&apos;s weekly visits.<br><br>We discussed providing an accounting of the hard drives to facilitate your conversations with personnel at Broadview:&#xA0;<br><br>&#x2022; On January 8, plaintiffs&apos; counsel delivered four hard drives to Broadview during an attorney visit. One was a 20 TB hard drive; three were 8 TB SSD drives.&#xA0;<br>&#x2022; On January 16, plaintiffs&apos; counsel received from Broadview one of the 8 TB SSD drives containing 150 GB of footage from 5 cameras for one week in January.&#xA0;<br>&#x2022; Also on January 16, plaintiffs&apos; counsel provided personnel at Broadview (SDDO Taylor, in particular) with two 18 TB hard drives.&#xA0;<br>&#x2022; The sum total of storage capacity Broadview should have is: 5 drives, with a total of 72 TB of space. Using the productions we have received to date, we anticipate that the Government owes us at least 15 TB of footage.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>Days later, the Department of Justice told the plaintiffs&#x2019; attorneys that &#x201C;they are still searching for those hard drives at Broadview.&#x201D; The plaintiffs&#x2019; attorneys responded: &#x201C;Losing multiple drives provided to facilitate speedy production is not acceptable,&#x201D; and &#x201C;the missing hard drives and lack of production of any footage predating January remains a significant, prejudicial issue.&#x201D;</p><p>A filing by the plaintiffs with the court highlights some of the ongoing issues they have had with the government complying with court-ordered discovery requirements, which includes the lost hard drives, missing footage, footage from only five of the 10 cameras that were supposed to be delivered. A separate filing notes that footage produced by the government from a high-profile visit by Noem is missing audio &#x201C;despite visible professional microphones and cell phones with audio capabilities in the footage.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Plaintiffs have gone above and beyond their obligations under federal law to streamline rolling production of such footage, purchasing expensive hard drives and agreeing to transport and pick up those drives from Broadview during weekly attorney visits. Defendants agreed to this arrangement,&#x201D; they wrote in the filing. &#x201C;Yet, Defendants have fallen unacceptably short of their production obligations. Defendants have provided <em>no</em> footage from five of the ten camera feeds [&#x2026;] Defendants have also failed to provide footage for a near-two-month span for the remaining five camera feeds. What&#x2019;s more, Defendants have purportedly lost multiple hard drives provided by Plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel [&#x2026;] There is no excuse for Defendants&#x2019; discovery failures.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>The filing notes that the five missing cameras are specifically from detainee isolation cells, &#x201C;despite those cells being a key part of Plaintiffs&#x2019; complaint.

This approach involved heating up iron metal with lasers to a fully-molten state that resembles ancient Earth&#x2019;s inner magma ocean, which reached temperatures up to 8,700&#xB0;F, and pressures more than a million times more intense than those we experience on Earth&#x2019;s surface.&#xA0;</p><p>The team then searched for the presence of hydrogen in nanostructures made primarily of silicon and oxygen. The results revealed that the core&#x2019;s hydrogen percentage sits between 0.07 to 0.36 percent, which works out to roughly nine-to-45 times the amount of the hydrogen in all of Earth&#x2019;s oceans.</p><p>But perhaps the most tantalizing part of the study is its implications for understanding the enigmatic origins of Earth&#x2019;s water, the wellspring of life on our world.</p><p>Some theories suggest that Earth&#x2019;s water was primarily delivered from extraterrestrial sources, such as comets and asteroids that impacted our planet as it was forming more than four billion years ago. An alternate possibility is that Earth&#x2019;s water was largely sourced from its building blocks, including vast interior reservoirs of hydrogen. This latter scenario is supported by the new study.</p><p>&#x201C;Although 71 percent of the Earth&#x2019;s surface is covered by ocean, mainly made of H, it has been argued that the majority of Earth&#x2019;s H had been stored in the core since its formation, ~4.5 billion years ago,&#x201D; the researchers said.</p><p>The estimates presented in the study &#x201C;require the Earth to obtain the majority of its water from the main stages of terrestrial accretion, instead of through comets during late addition,&#x201D; the team concluded.</p><p>The study certainly helps tackle the mystery of the precise contents of Earth&#x2019;s core, though the authors note that their estimate has large uncertainties that will need to be further narrowed down in future work. They also suggest that hydrogen alone cannot explain the density deficit, and that other light elements or compounds, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-0578-1?ref=404media.co"><u>water</u></a>, might be contributing to the discrepancy.</p><p>&#x201C;Compared to existing models for Earth&#x2019;s core composition this is a somewhat less H-rich core, and requires its density deficit to be accounted for by a mixture of light elements, rather than a single light species, akin to that of Mars&#x2019; core,&#x201D; the team said in the study.</p><p>Given that water is essential to all life on Earth, solving the riddle of its origins is the first step to understanding how our planet came to be inhabited, and whether other planets may commonly go through the same process.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA['The Most Dejected I’ve Ever Felt:' Harassers Made Nude AI Images of Her, Then Started an OnlyFans]]></title><description><![CDATA[Kylie Brewer isn't unaccustomed to harassment online.

And from a friend: &#x201C;Hey girl I hate to tell you this, but I think there&#x2019;s some picture of you going around. Maybe AI or deep fake but they don&#x2019;t look real. Uncanny valley kind of but either way I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>It was the first week of January, during the frenzy of <a href="https://www.404media.co/grok-ai-sexual-abuse-imagery-twitter/"><u>people using xAI&#x2019;s chatbot</u></a> and image generator Grok to create images of women and children partially or fully nude in sexually explicit scenarios. Between the last week of 2025 and the first week of 2026, Grok generated about three million sexualized images, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/22/grok-ai-generated-millions-sexualised-images-in-month-research-says?ref=404media.co"><u>according to researchers</u></a> at the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3ex92557jo?ref=404media.co"><u>police raided X&#x2019;s offices in France</u></a> as part of the government&#x2019;s investigation into child sexual abuse material on the platform.</p><!--members-only--><p>Messages from strangers and acquaintances are often the first way targets of abuse imagery learn that images of them are spreading online. Not only is the material disturbing itself &#x2014; everyone, it seems, has already seen it. Someone was making sexually explicit images of Brewer, and then, according to her followers who sent her screenshots and links to the account, were uploading them to an OnlyFans and charging a subscription fee for them.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;It was the most dejected that I&apos;ve ever felt,&#x201D; Brewer told me in a phone call. &#x201C;I was like, let&apos;s say I tracked this person down. Someone else could just go into X and use Grok and do the exact same thing with different pictures, right?&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylie.brewer/video/7593542443874700575" data-video-id="7593542443874700575" data-embed-from="oembed" style="max-width:605px; min-width:325px;"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@kylie.brewer" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylie.brewer?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">@kylie.brewer</a> <p>Please help me raise awareness and warn other women.

She&#x2019;s no stranger to online harassment. Being an outspoken woman about these and other issues through a leftist lens means she&#x2019;s faced the brunt of large-scale harassment campaigns primarily from the &#x201C;manosphere,&#x201D; including &#x201C;red pilled&#x201D; incels and right-wing influencers with podcasts for years. But when people messaged her in early January about finding an OnlyFans page in her name, featuring her likeness, it felt like an escalation.&#xA0;</p><p>One of the AI generated images was based on a photo of her in a swimsuit from her Instagram, she said. Someone used AI to remove her clothing in the original photo. &#x201C;My eyes look weird, and my hands are covering my face so it kind of looks like my face got distorted, and they very clearly tried to give me larger breasts, where it does not look like anything realistic at all,&#x201D; Brewer said. Another image showed her in a seductive pose, kneeling or crawling, but wasn&#x2019;t based on anything she&#x2019;s ever posted online. Unlike the &#x201C;nudify&#x201D; one that relied on Grok, it seemed to be a new image made with a prompt or a combination of images.&#xA0;</p><p>Many of the people messaging her about the fake OnlyFans account were men trying to get access to it. By the time she clicked a link one of them sent of the account, it was already gone. OnlyFans prohibits deepfakes and impersonation accounts. The platform did not respond to a request for comment. But OnlyFans isn&#x2019;t the only platform where this can happen: Non-consensual deepfake makers use platforms like <a href="https://www.404media.co/how-makers-of-nonconsensual-ai-porn-make-a-living-on-patreon/"><u>Patreon</u></a> to monetize abusive imagery of real people.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;I think that people assume, because the pictures aren&apos;t real, that it&apos;s not as damaging,&#x201D; Brewer told me. &#x201C;But if anything, this was worse because it just fills you with such a sense of lack of control and fear that they could do this to anyone. Children, women, literally anyone, someone could take a picture of you at the store, going grocery shopping, and ask AI or whatever to do this.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>A lack of control is something many targets of synthetic abuse imagery say they feel &#x2014; and it can be especially intense for people who&#x2019;ve experienced sexual abuse in real life. In 2023, after becoming the target of deepfake abuse imagery, popular Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/deepfake-qtcinderella-atrioc/?ref=404media.co"><u>QTCinderella told me</u></a> seeing sexual deepfakes of herself resurfaced past trauma. &#x201C;You feel so violated&#x2026;I was sexually assaulted as a child, and it was the same feeling,&#x201D; she said at the time. &#x201C;Like, where you feel guilty, you feel dirty, you feel like, &#x2018;what just happened?&#x2019; And it&#x2019;s bizarre that it makes that resurface. I genuinely didn&#x2019;t realize it would.&#x201D;</p><p>Other targets of deepfake harassment also feel like this could happen anytime, anywhere, whether you&#x2019;re at the grocery store or posting photos of your body online. For some, it makes it harder to get jobs or have a social life; the fear that anyone could be your harasser is constant. &#x201C;It&apos;s made me incredibly wary of men, which I know isn&apos;t fair, but [my harasser] could literally be anyone,&#x201D; Joanne Chew, another woman who dealt with severe deepfake harassment for months, <a href="https://www.404media.co/deepfakes-harassment-youtube-instagram-ai-generated-explicit-videos/"><u>told me last year</u></a>. &#x201C;And there are a lot of men out there who don&apos;t see the issue. They wonder why we aren&apos;t flattered for the attention.&#x201D;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.404media.co/deepfakes-harassment-youtube-instagram-ai-generated-explicit-videos/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">&#x2018;I Want to Make You Immortal:&#x2019; How One Woman Confronted Her Deepfakes Harasser</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">&#x201C;After discovering this content, I&#x2019;m not going to lie&#x2026; there are times it made me not want to be around any more either,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I literally felt buried.&#x201D;</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/icon/favicon-3-197.svg" alt="&apos;The Most Dejected I&#x2019;ve Ever Felt:&apos; Harassers Made Nude AI Images of Her, Then Started an OnlyFans"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">404 Media</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Samantha Cole</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/thumbnail/1920x1080_deepfakes_04-4.jpg" alt="&apos;The Most Dejected I&#x2019;ve Ever Felt:&apos; Harassers Made Nude AI Images of Her, Then Started an OnlyFans" onerror="this.style.display = &apos;none&apos;"></div></a></figure><p>Brewer&#x2019;s income is dependent on being visible online as a content creator. Logging off isn&#x2019;t an option. And even for people who aren&#x2019;t dependent on TikTok or Instagram for their income, removing oneself from online life is a painful and isolating tradeoff that they shouldn&#x2019;t have to make to avoid being harassed. Often, minimizing one&#x2019;s presence and accomplishments <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/girls-do-porn-still-fighting-harassment-youtube/?ref=404media.co"><u>doesn&#x2019;t even stop the harassment.</u></a></p><p>Since AI-generated face-swapping algorithms became accessible at the consumer level <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gal-gadot-fake-ai-porn/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">in late 2017</a>, the technology has only gotten better, more realistic, and its effects on targets harder to combat. It was always used for this purpose: to shame and humiliate women online. Over the years, various laws have attempted to protect victims or hold platforms accountable for non-consensual deepfakes, but most of them have either fallen short or present new risks of censorship and marginalize legal, consensual sexual speech and content online. The <a href="https://www.404media.co/ted-cruz-take-it-down-tools-to-address-known-exploitation-by-immobilizing-technological-deepfakes-on-websites-and-networks-act/"><u>TAKE IT DOWN Act</u></a>, championed by Ted Cruz and Melania Trump, passed into law in April 2025 as the first federal level legislation to address deepfakes; the law imposes a strict 48-hour turnaround requirement on platforms to remove reported content. President <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/trump-calls-congress-pass-overbroad-take-it-down-act-so-he-can-use-it-censor?ref=404media.co"><u>Donald Trump said</u></a> that he would use the law, because &#x201C;nobody gets treated worse online&#x201D; than him. And <a href="https://19thnews.org/2026/01/senate-defiance-act-nonconsensual-images-deepfakes/?ref=404media.co"><u>in January</u></a>, the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (DEFIANCE) Act passed the Senate and is headed to the House. The act would allow targets of deepfake harassment to sue the people making the content. But taking someone to court has always been a major barrier to everyday people experiencing harassment online; It&#x2019;s expensive and time consuming even if they can pinpoint their abuser. In many cases, including Brewer&#x2019;s, this is impossible&#x2014;it could be an army of people set to make her life miserable.</p><p>&#x201C;It feels like any remote sense of privacy and protection that you could have as a woman is completely gone and that no one cares,&#x201D; Brewer said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s genuinely such a dehumanizing and horrible experience that I wouldn&apos;t wish on anyone... I&#x2019;m hoping also, as there&apos;s more visibility that comes with this, maybe there&#x2019;s more support, because it definitely is a very lonely and terrible place to be &#x2014; on the internet as a woman right now.&#x201D;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Podcast: Ring Is Back and Scarier Than Ever]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ring is back with a feature for scanning your neighborhood; we bought a Super Bowl ad; and how Lockdown Mode stopped the FBI.]]></description><link>https://www.404media.co/podcast-ring-is-back-and-scarier-than-ever/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">698c894d7d51b700019c99e9</guid><category><![CDATA[Podcast]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joseph Cox]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:00:18 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/02/Ring-Is-Back-and-Scarier-Than-Ever--3-.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Benioff was giving the opening keynote at the Salesforce CKO event in Las Vegas on Tuesday, which is a major Salesforce meeting &#x2018;kicking off&#x2019; its strategy for the year. In his keynote, Benioff thanked international employees for traveling to the United States for the meeting, and asked them to stand. Benioff then said that ICE agents were in the building to keep tabs on them.</p><p>The comments instantly became a major topic of conversation on Saleforce&#x2019;s internal Slack, with shocked employees trying to figure out if they had misheard the CEO. One employee asked &#x201C;what was the ice joke?&#x201D; Another employee responded &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re visiting from outside the United States, please stand &#x2026; ICE is keeping track of that.&#x201D; Another said the joke was &#x201C;Please stand if you traveled here from abroad! Thank you! Just so the ICE agents know.&#x201D; And a third wrote that the joke was, &#x201C;roughly, &#x2018;Please everyone stand who traveled here internationally.&#x2019; And then while they are still standing, &#x2018;there are ICE agents in the hall to keep tabs on you.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The room groaned,&#x201D; one employee wrote on Slack. &#x201C;We couldn&#x2019;t believe he said that.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/salesforce-benioff-ice.html?ref=404media.co"><u>Salesforce&#x2019;s contracts with ICE</u></a> have been controversial within the company, which is part of why employees weren&#x2019;t happy with Benioff&#x2019;s joke.&#xA0;</p><p>San Francisco&apos;s Gazetteer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-ceo-ice-jokes-employee-event-2026-2?ref=404media.co"><u>first reported on Benioff&#x2019;s remarks</u></a>.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Do you know anything else about Benioff&apos;s comments or Salesforce? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at jason.404. Otherwise, send me an email at jason@404media.co.</strong></b></div></div><p>This is an example of &#x201C;Silicon Valley CEOs and their inability to divorce ICE and the complete lack of understanding of why that makes them monsters,&#x201D; a Salesforce employee told 404 Media. &#x201C;Employees are going absolutely apeshit in internal Slack about how completely awful it was.&#x201D; Another employee told 404 Media that Benioff &#x201C;then followed it up with a joke about not understanding the message of Bad Bunny&apos;s Super Bowl performance. On its own just seems out of touch, but coupled with the previous joke it does seem worse.&#x201D;</p><p>In a Slack channel called &#x201C;#airing-of-grievances,&#x201D; employees posted a meme of a Nazi officer that read &#x201C;Are we the baddies?&#x201D; Another wrote &#x201C;Serious question: would a statement of apology/recognition/whatever by someone (anyone) actually do anything at this point? Or has a rubicon of sorts been crossed?&#x201D; A third wrote &#x201C;It&#x2019;s super uncomfortable to me that this has been glossed over like ZERO mention of hey we hear your comments and your voice matters.&#x201D;</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
