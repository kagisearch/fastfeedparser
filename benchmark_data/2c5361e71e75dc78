<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side Expedition 2U</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>06 Feb 2026</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Adventurers</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Elixabete (Dwarf 4)</li>



<li>Firstleaf (Elf 2)</li>



<li>Groucho (Fighter 2)</li>



<li>Hartely (Bard 2)</li>



<li>Maistlyn (Magic User 2)</li>



<li>Mike (Cleric 4)</li>



<li>Assorted NPCs: Artizar (F1), Atze (T1), Ecclesdale (F1), Mendoria (MU1), Mitxel (F1), Negu (H2)</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On their return to the sunken hut, the party found some fresh footprints wandering about and then leading inland. Wary of another party of humans potentially at their backs, they splashed into the dungeon. With the main entrance chamber unoccupied, the group opted against further exploration through the secret door they’d discovered last time and instead headed for a door they’d seen down one corridor.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Raising their cloaks to their noses in a mild attempt to ward away the stench, they opened the door into a makeshift latrine. There was another door across the room, crudely-barricaded with a warning painted across it in a warped form of halflingo. Nobody was willing to wade over to investigate, so they sent Firstleaf over to have a look through it with his leather armour of ethereability.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On the other side of the door was a small room populated only by a swankily-dressed body pinned to the wall by a softly glowing sword. To the elf’s surprise, the figure raised his head and greeted the incorporeal interloper with a sharp-toothed grin. The unabashed vampire was all obsequious politeness, and requested aid in escaping in return for a solemn promise to not do them any harm and information on the Cardinal, the fellow in charge of this underground complex. Firstleaf promised to think about it, returned to fill in the rest of the party and, following precedent, they decided to leave for their future selves to deal with. The glowing sword might come in useful, after all.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Further exploration brought them to the sounds of multiple Angry Wee Fellows and, preferring not to leave so boisterous an enemy along any potential escape route, they charged in and attacked. Unfortunately, their attempt to burst through was once again hampered by an obstinate door, so the Awfs had enough warning to scramble behind some spiky barricades made of swords and wood.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The close-quarter-focused adventurers assaulted these defences while their ranged companions tried flinging spells and missiles from the doorway. Alas, Mendoria’s magical lullaby only affected one of them, and the little balls of hyperactive rage proved stiff resistance. For all his armour, Groucho was nearly cut down by an oversized sword and was forced to stagger back and receive a hasty prayer from Brother Mike.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The awfs fought violently to the last, but eventually party’s Magic Missiles, regular missiles, flaming oil and accumulated arsenal of enchanted weapons overcame their dozen foes. Just one remained, blinded by a Light spell and wrestled to the ground by four adventurers.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As soon as the party mentioned that they were here to deal fight the Kozengi, or whatever these “watery gits” were calling themselves, the captive was all to happy to cooperate, spewing forth his contempt for the three-eyed foe and proudly boasting of his duty to protect the “massive egg”. With his aggression seemingly diverted elsewhere, the party released him to convey their own feelings to the rest of his kind while they, bloodied after the fight, returned to Fourtowers Bridge to lick their wounds and make plans.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GM Notes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It has been wryly noted that we’ve come across a number of latrines and imprisoned immortals in these ‘side’ expeditions. While this is just the coincidence of two modules happening to have examples of each, it’s worth making a note that I may need to modify some of these features should they crop up in other modules. I don’t think they’re especially prevalent tropes in old school modules, but no harm in being mindful of avoidable patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Very simple to paint: Runic Grey speedpaint over an off-white basecoat, then a slightly watered-down Black Templar contrast paint along the top. My one working red paint with Skeleton Horde contrast paint over the top for the tongues, and the off-white to bring out the teeth.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Dahn Sarf Convention &#8211; One-Off Expedition i</h1>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bit of a change this session. I ran a game for five players in London as part of the Dahn Sarf Convention: three former and current Yeoldelands participants, and two newcomers. I&#8217;d wanted to run Waking of Willowby Hall for some time but it was tricky to slot into the campaign: having the giant and thieves waiting to be triggered into action merely by the PC&#8217;s presence feels rather arbitrary, and it would be a real push to fit into our 2.5-hour sessions (and its timer-based escape room-like doesn&#8217;t split up well across expeditions), Perfect for a longer-session one-shot, though.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s quite a bit longer than normal; hopefully it might give any would-GMs of this module an idea of the structure (or at least how we went about it) which is the sort of thing I find helpful in after-action reports of published adventures. Rather than tag the GM notes on the end as usual, I think they warrant a blog post of their own. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Warning: clear spoilers for Waking of Willowby Hall ahead.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>31 Jan 2026</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Adventurers</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bruce the Robber (Thief 1)</li>



<li>Eryck the Widely-Read (Magic User 1)</li>



<li>Ethel the Unread (Halfling 1)</li>



<li>Infirmity Jainne (Cleric 1)</li>



<li>Violent Elizabeth (Fighter 1)</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A shared debt of 3000gp had brought the adventurers to this old abandoned manor. The front door was unlocked, leading to a marbled hallway. As they were investigating the twelve pillars with curious sigils decorating each one, a distant bellowing became audible. It grew louder, and larger than any human voice had a right to be. Three more adventurers dashed in through the double doors, an angrily-honking goose under one of their arms, and they fled further into the building in an evident panic.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Poking his head outside, Eryck was greeted by a 30ft-tall figure, decked out with flowing robe and beard and swinging a large bell at the end of a chain. The magic user tentatively tried to engage him in conversation but the giant merely bellowed: “Thief! Give me back my Mildred!” and swung the bell against the hastily-shut door, making the whole building shudder. One of the marble pillars cracked and its sigil winked out of existence. Peering through one of the windows, the massive bellringer saw the party lingering as they discussed their options, and smashed the glass with his makeshift flail. The group exchanged glances and quickly determined to find that trio.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Two of them, including the goose-carrier, had fled up the hall’s grand staircase so the party decided to go that way. Finding a corridor with a whole lot of doors, they happened upon the pair behind their first pick. A woman held the goose under one arm, and she let go of its bill with the other to grab a staff by her side and pointed it threateningly towards the doorway.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The other woman raised a hand and a hook to try and deescalate the situation. Ignoring her sullen companion, the adventurers found out that this negotiator was Lisbet, and that she just wanted to get out of here. The giant outside was after this goose, but the concerningly-named Apocalypse Ann outright refused to part with it, and waved her arcane-looking staff menacingly. Deciding that this could only end in tears, the party backed out and decided to at least try and find something of value in case they ever did make it out.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There were a few gold coins in the other rooms, evidently servants’ quarters, and a brown cloak. Eryck tried it on, just in case, but alas, it seemed to just be an old travelling cloak. Of more immediate interest and use were the beds which got relocated to blockade the two goose thieves in their own little room. A few muffled curses from within were punctuated by the sound of the bell once again striking the building somewhere.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One door led to a fancier bedroom. While Ethel found some sheet music &#8211; Lavinia’s Sonnet &#8211; Elizabeth pulled out a chest from underneath the dusty old bed, and Bruce set to work with his thieves’ tools. Inside lay some fine travelling clothes (far better than Eryck’s grotty old cloak) which Elizabeth claimed and a cluster of handheld bombs. These were eagerly divided out as another bell clang shook the manor, at which point a dull crash of a heavy stone hitting the ground echoed throughout the corridors, and the fireplace in the bedroom burst into flame.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The party followed a set of stairs up to the roof, hoping to scout out a possible escape root. No such luck &#8211; the giant, while he hadn’t noticed them &#8211; would have a clear line of sight anywhere around the building, but they did find an old ballista up in the tower. Nothing to load it with, but surely they could find some makeshift missiles.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After a quick scurry across the rooftop to examine and then disregard the beacon in the other tower, they descended back down inside and explored the library. Hearing murmurs and whispers coming from the books, Eryck unfurled one of his scrolls and cast Detect Magic. No immediately obvious magical item revealed itself, but there seemed to be a haze throughout the rooms and corridors he could see. The group left the books to their squabbles over alchemy and botany, heading to the building’s other wing.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Finding a room full of mouldy smoking jackets and a big mirror, they spied a stout fellow in a fez in the reflection with no clear source, but their musings about him were interrupted by a cry of alarm through another door, and the clash of blades. Racing through, they found the third thief desperately fighting off a large, dark-armoured figure, and they sprang to his aid.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Violent Elizabeth drew the knight’s attention, parrying its blows while the new, temporary ally was dragged to the safety of the dressing room. Realising it was an empty suit of armour they were facing, Bruce snuck up behind it, flipped up its visor and chucked his bomb inside. The ensuing bang turned the figure into a shape closer resembling a barrel, and the party were eventually able to overcome their foe. The armour crumbled into dust, and then vanished. Before they could investigate further, a bellow came from outside as the gaint, drawn by the explosion, swung his bell at the windows. They fled.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Back among the smoking jackets, the quivering rescuee was being fortified with a few sips of cheap wine, and he presented himself as Helmut, ally to Apocalypse Ann and Lisbet but, y’know, not that close to them. Stealing the goose had all been Ann’s idea anyway since she probably wanted all the golden eggs it laid.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Eyes shining like gold pieces, the party encouraged him to tag along with them, assuring him they could get him out safely. They asked about a supply of weapons anywhere, and he mentioned seeing a room downstairs teeming with weaponry. The quickest way there was through the western stairwell, but he refused to go back that way &#8211; that was where the dread knight had come from &#8211; so the party doubled back to the marble hall, noting nearly half the pillars were now cracked, and followed Helmut’s directions through the downstairs.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Spying a harpsichord on the way, Ethel insisted on trying out the sheet music she’d found. A disgruntled aristocratic voice interrupted her recital, and a haughty spectral lady flounced through the wall. Spotting Eryck in a servant’s cloak, she started barking out orders to move the harpiscord up the guest room like she’d asked many times already.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Affronted by the initial attitude of the party, she seemed mollified after a bit of kowtowing, limiting her threats to merely informing Lord Fenwick of their behaviour. Her responses to their queries about the manor were still snooty since she didn’t appreciate cleaning the place taking priority over moving her harpsichord, but she muttered in exasperation something about Fenwick’s wand probably still being in the dining room where he left it, before storming off in a huff.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unfortunately for the party, as they entered the next room they realised the giant was still loitering at that end of the building, and he spied them through the window. He smashed the window and snatched up Jainne. Deciding there was little they could physically do to help her, everyone else scurried through the sitting room, calling out that, look, they’d spotted the goose over here! The huge figure flung his quarry down and gave chase. They pointed up the stairs and kept him looking up their for a moment, enough time to drag the crumpled form of their cleric into what was most definitely a weapons room. As she read off a prayer of healing from her scroll, the rest of party loaded up on as many spears as they could carry.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Then it occurred to them that there was a significant chunk of map with unaccounted for with no obvious entrances, and they zeroed in on a glass display case. Shifting it carefully aside, they found a hidden door which opened into an unlit room. What light they did have from the windows behind them showed a vast array of mushrooms. They picked some, reasoning there might be a book or two in the library that might give enough info to sell these on back in civilisation.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A cry of terror from the next room on brought them back to their more immediate concerns. Opening the door they saw Lisbet locked in a struggle with an owlbear which seemed to have stepped down from a display and was attempting to savage the one-handed thief. The party urged Helmut forward to help his erstwhile companion but the fighter was very skeptical about the need for valour. They handed him a random mushroom, assuring him it would empower him with the resolve necessary.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Helmut munched nervously as Lisbet fought on, and suddenly a mass of rats emerged from the creaky floorboards to present themselves in formation before him. Somewhat bemused, he tentatively directed them towards the owlbear and they started swarming the monster. It, however, was unhampered by their gnawing attacks and nonchalantly cut down the thief down.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Helmut quietly closed the door on the melee between rodent and mutant hybrid, “Oh well, I tried.”</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Understandably reluctant to try that route to the eastern stairwell and ballista, the party checked to make sure the giant had moved on from the western side of the manor and crept on up to the roof. Ethel was slipping and sliding about, and seemed to be sweating a considerable amount of unpleasant slime. Apparently she’d had a nibble on another mushroom out of curiosity. She was especially careful crossing the rooftop with the others to offload their spears by the siege weapon.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">They weren’t sure it would be enough to finish off the giant, so Bruce proposed an idea for softening the great brute up.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A little while later, the giant found himself being quietly called for. Squinting down, he saw a halfling and a human carrying the still, silent form of his goose. In stage whispers, they indicated they’d fought off the thieves and rescued her, and after her travails she’d fallen asleep. They were willing to hand her over for safe passage out. The giant, in his own booming hushed tones, indicated he wanted the thieves’ heads, but would be taking Mildred for now. Just to be safe.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As Ethel handed over the still form in the giant’s outstretched hand, Elizabeth surreptitiously lit the fuse to one of the bombs concealed in the mass of rotten wood and manky feathers taken from the various beds around the building, held together by the mushroom-induced sweaty slime. The pair raced back into the building while the enormous besieger poked suspiciously at the thing in his hand.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Upon hearing the explosion, Jainne hastily started loading the ballista with an old spear. Eryck lit the oil flask attached to it, and then resident archer Bruce launched it as the giant staggered back from the blast. His aim was true and the makeshift bolt struck his target’s shoulder, the oil smashing and splashing around the point of impact.<br>With a murderous look in his eyes and fire in beard, the giant charged the tower. Jainne flung herself to the side to avoid his grasp, but Helmut was not so quick. He was lifted high in the air, ready to be brought down with a brutal and unsurvivable splat, but the raised arm gave Bruce the perfect opening to fire another quickly-loaded spear into the giant’s heart.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With a great crash, he toppled over backward, dropping Helmut some forty feet to the ground. Remarkably, some moans from the fighter indicated the fall hadn’t been deadly, but there was no time to worry about that now: the party dashed down to the marble hall, sure that Apocalypse Ann would have heard the commotion and try to make a break for it.<br>Sure enough, she appeared at the top of the great staircase, goose still under one arm. The party insisted she hand the goose over, believing their giant-killing efforts efforts merited a strong claim to the jackpot. Ann shrugged in response and raised her staff.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A fireball shot towards the party who dived for cover. All were to some degree singed, but poor Jainne, still feeling the impact of the giant’s grip, was incinerated. The rogue caster tried to make a break for the door but one of Bruce’s arrows in the leg halted her escape, and Elizabeth’s greatsword separated her head from her body. Momentarily freed, the goose made to dash back further into the building but Eryck flopped down on top of it, determined not to spend a moment longer in the wretched manor.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">With the gold egg-laying goose now in their possession, the party reckoned it was just a matter of waiting until they had enough to pay off their debts. No need to risk the magically-charged Willowby Hall any further, especially with that owlbear still on the loose. They headed around outside the eastern side of the hall, ostensibly to rescue Helmut but with an eye on the giant’s quality silk robe. Unfortunately it was badly burnt but at least some of it could salvaged to pass on to a keen merchant. As they were cutting the unsinged parts away, they happened to notice a shiny gem lodged amongst the beard bristles. Packing away that and hoisting the bell between them &#8211; surely the town would pay handsomely to have that back &#8211; they made their way back through the woods towards civilisation, dragging the moaning Helmut behind them.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side Expedition 2T</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>29 Jan 2026</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Adventurers</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Edward (Cleric 3)</li>



<li>Elixabete (Dwarf 4)</li>



<li>Fezziwig (Thief 1)</li>



<li>Firstleaf (Elf 2)</li>



<li>Groucho (Fighter 2)</li>



<li>Hartley (Bard 2)</li>



<li>Maistlyn (Magic User 2)</li>



<li>Mike (Cleric 4)</li>



<li>Assorted NPCs: Artizar (F1), Atze (T1), Ecclesdale (F1), Mendoria (MU1), Mitxel (F1), Negu (H2)</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Pondering whether this newly discovered underground network might be the Angry Wee Folk’s route through to the Gatehouse’s mining operation, the adventurers packed their bags and set off once more for the submerged ruins.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After Fezziwig had discovered the trapped alarm to have been reset, they proceeded cautiously into the statue room. The bodies had gone, dragged off to the west, and all the many swords compiled into a single pile before the towering form. The party spread out, some watching the exits while the others examined the pile and the chamber’s walls, spotting the faint indication of a doorway hidden in the wall behind the statue.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As Elixabete and Fezziwig checked the door for danger, a ghostly, crowned, three-eyed Kozengi form &#8211; the first non-skeletal sample they&#8217;d seen &#8211; emerged through the rock, wailing and sobbing in a distant voice. It flung itself to the ground, begging for forgiveness before disappearing. Immediately the air was filled with clangs as all the swords the party had been carrying suddenly became to heavy to bear and plunged to the ground. Unable to lift them, the party redistributed their remaining weapons to ensure most remained armed in some form, and then pushed open the hidden door.</p>

</figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">They were greeted by the sight of an enormous sandpit populated with sandy humanoid figures engaged in an endless melee, dissolving and reforming as they lost their individual bouts. Spotting another glowing sword working its way through different sedimentary opponents, the party sought a way through to grab it. Firstleaf tried striding over to it with the confidence of an official with a lanyard and a piece of paper, but he was forced to retreat in the face of a sparring partner rising from the ground to face him.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mike and his retainers started filling helmets with water and dousing the figures, and that seemed to work, turning them to immobile mud forms, but such was the size of the pit that they had no hope of reaching any of the duellists near the centre.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Trusting in his collection of magical protections, Groucho was next to brave the pit, but he found his progress halted by more opponents rising up. He edged back to safety, drawing all the sandy figures towards the doorway, and the rest of the party sprang to his aid, cutting through the duellists and grabbing the blade.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After emptying their boots of sand, the adventurers found that their own swords were once again usable but decided to return to town anyway to investigate this trio of sigil-marked blades they’d discovered.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GM Notes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Not my strongest GM performance: a lot of head space was taken up with mentally preparing for running a game at the Dahn Sarf convention in two days’ time, so didn’t feel quite as at ease with last-minute changes of plans. The players had discussed heading further afield to find some elves who might be able to grant them access to some higher-level magic firepower to deal with the Snake-Armed Goddess’ statue, and I had to plead for a bit more warning; my head wasn’t in the game for a fully improvised session. The players seemed happy to go back to Plan A.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side Expedition 2S</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>22 Jan 2026</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Adventurers</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Elixabete (Dwarf 4)</li>



<li>Groucho (Fighter 1)</li>



<li>Hartley (Bard 1)</li>



<li>Mike (Cleric 4)</li>



<li>Assorted NPCs: Artizar (F1), Atze (T1), Ecclesdale (F1), Mitxel (F1), Negu (H2),</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After some overhead scouting astride the nearly fully grown griffons failed to reveal an immediately obvious hideout for the ambushing brigands in the woods, the party decided to explore a little way downriver, particularly interested in an old, partially submerged hut built into the cliffs.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Sploshing around the doorway revealed some swords underwater, all made out of different, bizarre materials such as leather and deteriorating rat corpses, reminding the adventurers of the peculiar blades they’d found on the Angry Wee Fellows in the copper mine. Warily, they advanced along a tunnel into the cliff, finding and triggering a trap which set off some form of alarm.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After waiting to see if anyone would come, they continued on to find half a dozen of the diminutive humanoids having a competitive punch up while they waited for the intruders. Negu tried translating the party’s various attempts to look threatening while promising peace. Confused, the least small awf asked for clarity. When the adventurers assured peace, the wild-haired green scrappers rolled their eyes, exclaimed, “Boring!” and charged.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The adventurers ran forward to meet them and bring their numbers and size to bear, and the awfs were cut down without loss, fighting aggressively to the last.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The party went about healing their wounded and sent Atze, their newly hired thief, to climb up a great statue depicting a three-eyed Kozengi warrior and start prying out a particularly shiny and expensive-looking central eye. As she did so, the others extracted two softly glowing swords from a pile.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mitxel gave a whispered warning: he’d spied another pile of swords approaching, seemingly hovering in the air, from one of the corridors leading out. The adventurers hid behind some pillars and doused their light sources. By the faint glow from the two weapons they’d found, they saw the other gathered swords slowly approach them.#</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As it disappeared around one pillar, Mike felt a burning pain as something moist and gloopy eased up his sleeve. Shaking life back into it, he struck his magical torch alight and saw more clearly now a gelatinous mass looming over him. He and Ecclesdale scrambled back, and the party launched their entire arsenal of oil flasks at the oozing cube.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After it had fizzled into nothing, they packed away the glowing swords and splashed out the ruined hut back to safety, eager to find a buyer for Atze’s sizeable gem.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GM Notes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having discussed bandit hunting throughout the week running up to this session, the players decided to volte face and opted to explore the little hut that had been on the map for the last year or so. This is where the easy-to-read dungeon come into their own; I’d read this module a while ago, but definitely needed to refresh my memory while the players pondered their equipment stocks. Succinct, characterful room keys are a GM’s best friend.</li>



<li>Nearly got Mike with the near-invisible gelatinous cube. Could almost hear the slaps to the forehead as the more experienced players finally realised what was in front of them.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While rummaging around in my box of old miniatures for something to give away in the <strong><a href="https://bedroombattlefields.com/podcast/">Tabletop Miniature Hobby Podcast</a></strong> secret santa last month (ended up passing on some Perry Miniatures pieces which had lain untouched for over a decade; the new owner has nearly finished them already), I came across an old Games Workshop ghoul which I had given a fairly crude sepia wash to be part of the <strong><a href="https://therecouldhavebeensnakes.wordpress.com/2018/01/12/the-cult-of-the-beetle/">Cult of the Beetle</a></strong> and then left collecting dust. Distinct in style from the <strong><a href="https://therecouldhavebeensnakes.wordpress.com/2025/11/08/a-15mm-giant-28mm-troll/">previous giant</a></strong> but still giving off the same vibes as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2Rz_NbP5o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>animated BFG</strong></a>. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A couple of layers of Pallid Bone speed paint, then highlighted with Vallejo Stone Grey with a bit off white mixed in. Then some Army Painter Strong Tone dabbed into some nooks and crannies. A fairly quick job; just took forever to get around to doing the ever laborious chore of basing it properly. A shame that I&#8217;d had to rip it from the clear base it had been on, but it&#8217;s better to fit in with the rest of the minis and allow space for magnetising.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side Expedition 2R</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>15 Jan 2026</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Adventurers</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Edward (Cleric 3)</li>



<li>Elixabete (Dwarf 4)</li>



<li>Firstleaf (Elf 2)</li>



<li>Groucho (Fighter 1)</li>



<li>Hartley (Bard 1)</li>



<li>Mike (Cleric 4)</li>



<li>Assorted NPCs: Ecclesdale (F1), Flintoffden (MU1), Mendoria (MU1), Mitxel (F1), Negu (H2),</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There was more loot to be found in the collapsed chambers, the adventurers were sure, so they loaded up on supplies and headed once more for the Gatehouse. They looked out for but saw no sign of their hairy scout, Grutz.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Making a detour for the copper mine, the party pondered what to do with the chained skeleton wreathed in blue flames. A few were willing to release him now they had the means to do so, but the majority were against the idea, either out suspicion of the prisoner’s true nature or because they were unwilling to risk losing the enchanted gems. Eventually Groucho stepped forward with his magical spear and put the skeleton out of his misery. The flames vanished, the chains shattered and the gems lost their power anyway.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Under Elixabete’s dwarven guidance, the party spent the next three days working their way around the Four-Armed Goddess’ temple, carefully avoiding the trapped statue. They spotted a hidden compartment and drew out a snake-shaped staff, but that was all the loot they discovered. Firstleaf went slightly insane after studying some dodgy serpent-like glyphs for too long, and a room of a former priestess yielded nothing but some crude stone jewellery.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Conscious of the chests of coins they’d seen in the goddess’ main room, they decided to try their luck with the statue once again. They used the snake staff to bind two of its arms and hacked away at it but the narrow space they were able to clear hampered their efforts. As the statue started wrenching itself free from the rubble, grabbing Groucho and hurling him against the rocks, the adventurers decided beat a retreat.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As they scampered back down to Fourtowers Bridge, cliff on one side and woods on the other, they were held up by a dozen armed thugs. A voice called from the trees, declaring that there were more out of sight and that the party should for everyone’s sake lay down whatever the riches they’d unearthed from the Gatehouse and leave peacefully. The adventurers charged.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Crossbow bolts flew from the treeline, injuring several of the party and killing Flintoffden, before they crashed into the line of spears. Mendoria’s arcane drowsiness again came in handy, downing most of the visible foes while Firstleaf’s armour of ethereability allowed him to dash into the wood and try and draw some of the ranged attacks. He unfurled a scroll to trap several of them while his companions ran to join him, having dealt with the first dozen.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As the unstuck brigands scarpered further into the woods, a fancily-armoured and near-invisibly-cloaked woman leapt down from a tree; she hurled an oil flask onto the web, roasting the trapped bandits, and winked out of sight. Firstleaf’s keen elven eyes just about spied her reappearing far away amongst the trees, joining her fleeing companions.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The party gathered up their fallen retainer and returned to the safety of the village, leaving the dead scoundrels for the wildlife.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GM Notes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The characters’ adventures have largely been confined to dungeons; it’s been a while since they have come across a violent encounter outdoors. (Largely this has been because I’ve just not rolled that many. Pretty sure these dice need to take the saltwater test.) I’ve been modifying the possible encounters according to party actions just like with the underground tables, modifying some entries or replacing them with other, more appropriate ones. And I’ve now finally started noting them down in the campaign scrapbook again &#8211; fewer rifling through papers going forward, hopefully.</li>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side Expedition 2Q</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>06 Jan 2026</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Adventurers</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Edward (Cleric 3)</li>



<li>Elixabete (Dwarf 4)</li>



<li>Firstleaf (Elf 2)</li>



<li>Groucho (Fighter 1)</li>



<li>Hartley (Bard 1)</li>



<li>Mike (Cleric 4)</li>



<li>Assorted NPCs: Ecclesdale (F1), Flintoffden (MU1), Mendoria (MU1), Mitxel (F1), Negu (H2),</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The villagers had heard enough tales of the gatehouse to refuse any prospect of spending too much time within it, and it seemed anyone signing up for the task would want a cut of the profits, so the adventurers decided to carry out the collapsed temple excavation project themselves.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The initial excursion took them down to the copper mine to see what serviceable tools remained, stopping by to see how the chained, flaming skeleton was doing. Still in agony, it seemed, and spotting the magical gems hanging around several party members’ necks he begged them to release him. More immersed in the ways of Holy Harold now, Mike channelled his divine vision to determine that the skeleton was of a decidedly chaotic nature. Assuring him that would definitely be back, the party withdrew to ponder the significance of this, taking a number of shovels and pickaxes with them.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It turned out that the cave affected pretty much the entirety of the Snake-Armed Goddess’ temple area. Firstleaf went in with the armour of ethereability to confirm the extent of the collapse, and found the four-armed stone guardian wedged under some rubble but still active.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>

</figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The party returned to the village for supplies of lamp oil and food, and working their way through the fallen stone under Elixabete’s dwarven guidance. They worked in shifts, half the band mining, shifting rubble or guarding at any one time while the rest did what they could to get some rest in the level above, avoiding the torture chambers and cells for the more habitable rooms.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Other than the occasional sound of something moving on the other side of the spiked door, which the guards had no desire to investigate, the adventurers were able to work this way for a full two days, crafting a path through to the room full of holy symbols they’d seen during their first descent. Holy Harold’s blessing, through Mike, ensured they could work their way through the room untroubled, and eventually they gathered up a pile of amulets of various designs and materials.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Believing there to be more treasure down here, especially beyond the trapped stone statue, the party decided to return to the village for the time being to see some daylight again and look for some passing merchants with an interest in religious iconography.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GM Notes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I don’t know the next thing about mining and excavating, so I’m sure the timings we worked out for the party to work their way through the cave in were well below a realistic estimate. Rather than bog the game down, though, I went for something gameable: two hours to work through a 5’ square, assuming two characters doing the digging and two clearing the rubble. We could work that out on the map nice and quickly, players could make decisions as to which way they wanted to go and when, and the remarkably efficient progress could be handwaved as being down to having a dwarf in charge.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Side Expedition 2P</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><em>11 Dec 2025</em></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Adventurers</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Carbel (Halfling 4)</li>



<li>Edward (Cleric 2)</li>



<li>Elixabete (Dwarf 4)</li>



<li>Mike (Cleric 4)</li>



<li>Assorted NPCs: Ecclesdale (F1), Flintoffden (MU1), Koldobike (E1), Negu (H2)</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The band of adventurers returned to the gatehouse, making their way back down to the copper mine level to pick up their metallic construct to weaponise against Contithius, the Snake-Armed Goddess’ guardian with a charming hold over the hairy ones. Unfortunately, the found Metal Mickey in pieces and surrounded by several corpses of the little humanoid bundles of rage they’d encountered on previous expeditions. The rope the construct had been guarding had also been cut from the bottom, and there was no sign of the raft it had been securing.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After fighting their way through a roaming band of live little angry humanoids, the party headed for the Snake-Armed Goddess’ temple. They quickly and silently cut down several snake and hairy guards, rescuing a pair of kidnapped caravan guards and convincing them to aid in the upcoming battle.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unfortunately their lowered shoulders were once again insufficient to bash down the door to the temple quickly enough to seize the element of surprise, and so the goddess’ disciples were ready for the party’s assault. Missiles flew and destroyed what turned out to be Contithius’ mirrored images, and both sides exchanged sleep-inducing spells, sending the majority of the combatants into an enchanted doze.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>

</figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mike, blinded by some sorcery from the hairy chief’s axe, scrabbled around on the floor to wake his companions while Elixabete, having wrenched the charm-protecting shield from his grasp, took on the human-headed snake herself.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unfortunately, Edward and Carbel were not so well protected and found themselves falling under the guardian’s charms and waking up the dormant hairy ones before wrestling the dwarf to the ground. Fortunately the newly awakened Koldobike was out of reach and able to pick off a few shots, and then slew Contithius with her spear when the serpentine guardian, seeing the hairy ones drop one by one, made a break for the grand set of double doors which led to the Snake-Armed Goddess’ sanctuary.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The charm lifted from the rest of the party and final hairy one. Ash his comrades recovered and grabbed Corinthius’ fancy-looking headpiece, Edward remembered the treasure trove that lay beyond those double doors and marched through. He firmly rejected the Snake-Armed Goddess’ proposal that he enter her service, and the enormous statue of her rumbled into life. The party fell back before its fierce blows, with both rescued prisoners walloped to death, and fled back up the stairs. The statue’s flailing fists struck the walls and ceiling, and Elixabete’s dwarven ears pricked up at the sounds of an almighty cave in.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bemoaning the fortune now buried beneath the rubble with a rather nasty sentry, the party dragged their battered, weary bodies back to the safety of Fourtowers Bridge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GM Notes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I need to get back in the habit of using the old campaign scrapbook, having reverted to scribbling session notes and prep in whichever pad of paper happens to be closest to hand. The two big fights found me referencing characters and monster stat blocks across four different sheets in three different pads, and it made the experience needlessly tricky. The campaign scrapbook had me putting in the effort up front by cutting up and pasting a load of dungeons to populate the map, and saved a lot more effort in the long run as I just had to pencil in notes in the copious amounts of white space I’d left by room keys. Ought to remember that lesson.</li>
</ul>
