  <description>&lt;p&gt;ANKARA, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Israel&#039;s recognition of the breakaway Republic of Somaliland would not benefit Somaliland or the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Erdogan had said Israel&#039;s decision to formally recognise Somaliland, a northern region that declared itself independent in 1991, was illegal and unacceptable, and he accused Israel of trying to destabilise the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;By Laila Bassam and Tala Ramadan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Armed group Hezbollah rejected on Tuesday the Lebanese government&#039;s decision to grant the army at least four months to advance the second phase of a nationwide disarmament plan, saying it would not accept what it sees as a move serving Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lebanon&#039;s cabinet tasked the army in August 2025 with drawing up and beginning to implement a plan to bring all armed groups&#039; weapons under state control, a bid aimed primarily at disarming Hezbollah after its devastating war with Israel in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
