      <title>JOHN WICK THE MOVIE: THE VIDEOGAME: THE VIDEOGAME</title>

      <description>There is no need for an Untitled John Wick Game because the John Wick films are already video games.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last night at the PlayStation State of Play advert extravaganza, a new currently untitled John Wick game was revealed. The trailer weaves between scenes of the legendary assassin undergoing a tailoring session with a number of brutal fights depicting scenarios that played out in some form across the four Wick films. It’s an impressive display of animation and visual fidelity and, hey, it’s Keanu Reeves from all of those compilations of ‘Keanu Reeves being a nice guy’ on YouTube. But what are we doing here, chums? There is no need for an &lt;strong&gt;Untitled John Wick Game&lt;/strong&gt; because the John Wick films are already video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbyUZhheUSQ" title="Untitled John Wick Game - Official Reveal Trailer | State of Play 2026" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In aesthetic theorists… wait, wait, don’t go, I promise we’ll get back John Wick soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 80s, aesthetic theories, curious around the ‘interactivity’ of art, started to dip their toes into the work of reception theorists. Reception studies is simply the field concerned with how audiences engage with texts, how they receive meaning, negotiate it and reproduce it. &lt;a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/2043612.2043617' target='_blank'&gt;Much ink was spilled&lt;/a&gt; about how the only truth to be found in film (or any artistic production) was uncovered in the act of spectating. Before interactivity in the arts became shorthand for ‘pressing buttons’, it referred largely to the subjective meaning making of audiences experiencing art. In &lt;a href='https://monoskop.org/images/6/6b/Eco_Umberto_The_Open_Work.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;The Open Work&lt;/a&gt;, Umberto Eco described texts as “fields of meaning” open for us to frolic in and make sense of. Watching a film is an interactive experience inherently but, for the purposes of this blog, I believe that watching and interpreting a film is also an exercise in active play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The John Wick films borrow so much visual language from video games. I would have said this even before the &lt;a href='https://kotaku.com/john-wick-chapter-4-keanu-reeves-hotline-miami-top-down-1850269679' target='_blank'&gt;top-down &lt;strong&gt;Hotline Miami&lt;/strong&gt; sequence in Wick: Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt;. The John Wick films are third-person cinematic shooters. They’re light on dialogue, the main character has a health bar that’s balanced for fighting hundreds of enemy combatants, it has a playful relationship with violence, and even has huge set pieces for its climactic boss fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whether you want to approach it in form (film) or function (genre), the John Wick films are as videogame as a film can be; as much as 12 Angry Men is a visual novel. The reality as I see it is that the boundary between these mediums is more fluid than is convenient to consider. Interactivity doesn’t make a visual art - like film -  a ‘game’ anymore than featuring Hollywood actors makes games films. It’s more complicated than that and is only going to get more complicated as games ask less of us (see: &lt;a href='https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/' target='_blank'&gt;Sony AI patent will see PlayStation games play themselves when players are stuck&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/screenshot-2026-02-13-160851.webp" alt="Screenshot 2026-02-13 160851" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the John Wick reveal I saw a post that said something to the effect of “All videogames are John Wick anyway”. Which walks backwards into what I’m trying to argue here. John Wick uses the visual and mechanical vocabulary of videogames because videogames transposed that language from Hong Kong Action Films. It’s a cyclical process of transcreation, each step amending the texture of the core ideas of the action genre at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Untitled John Wick&lt;/strong&gt; game is not transcreation, it’s redundant. Even if it acts as a companion piece to the films or a new story told in this medium, it doesn’t take away from this feeling that a triple-AAA action game is perhaps the least interesting way of exhibiting John Wick. Bithell Games’ &lt;strong&gt;John Wick Hex&lt;/strong&gt; took the cinematic origins of the series and performed mechanical invention by re-appropriating the timeline function of media editors and turning it into a piece of strategy game UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/john_wick_hex_chinatown_1.webp" alt="John_Wick_Hex_Chinatown_1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all tired of the discourse around remakes, remasters and studios not wanting to take risks of new worlds and stories, I get it. But Untitled John Wick is a particularly egregious example. If we’re going to live in a culture of adaptation, these safe-bet games should at least generate new meanings and avenues for exploration. I don’t want a quick-time event where I press X to puncture a guy’s ear with a pencil, he falls to the floor, I point at the screen, mouth agape, exclaiming “it’s just like the movie!!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s the problem, it’s just like the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JOHN HIGHGUARD HAS COME UNSTUCK IN TIME.</title>
      <link>https://killjoy.bearblog.dev/john-highguard-has-come-unstuck-in-time/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/gh8yuaaxtzjbndknvf8n3d-1.webp" alt="gh8YUaaxTZjBNdknvf8n3d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Highguard has come unstuck in time. John has gone to sleep a consummate gamer and awakened arthritic. He vaulted into a mech in 2017 and landed on a horse in 2026. He has fallen off that horse to find himself escaping an enclosing ring of antimatter in 2019. He has seen his rebirth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all the games in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highguard is a free-to-play, 3v3 online multiplayer shooter from some of the developers behind Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends. John Highguard, colloquially named in retaliation for Highguard's cryptic launch, represents a cycle of newer multiplayer shooters that are considered an affront to the medium of games by the Internet Gaming Community - most of which don't really play games. It is astonishing how uncontroversial its quality is. It is one of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; shooters: not particularly revolutionary, not offensively bad. Not that I’m a good judge. When it comes to shooters, I too am unstuck in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="600" height="325" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZQEns6tkNg" title="Highguard - Official Launch Trailer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind and body are dislodged between realities. My mind believes I am a decent multiplayer shooter player despite not playing one ‘seriously’ since Titanfall 2 in 2017 which was, what? Four years ago? My body, despite being stronger than it has ever been, is stiff and sluggish once the firefights begin. When the bullets rain down at seemingly convex angles, my shields pop and my health begins to tank, my body constricts, my hands tighten and I become unstuck in myself. A frustration bubbles as my mind tries to puppet my body into ducking into cover or shooting back or deploying an evasion ability. Instead, I wiggle my reticle around until I’m dead. This process occurred over and over in the five or so hours of Highguard I played. I was not improving one iota. By sitting in that frustration, by wrestling with an angst that my reactions had been dulled by the years, I found clarity: maybe these games have left me behind and maybe that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/can-anybody-tell-me-what-game-this-is-i-cropped-from-a-meme-v0-6z3het6csjt81.webp" alt="can-anybody-tell-me-what-game-this-is-i-cropped-from-a-meme-v0-6z3het6csjt81" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Navarro-Remesal has a wonderful new book out from MIT Press called &lt;a href='https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/6083/Zen-and-Slow-Games' target='_blank'&gt;Zen and Slow Games&lt;/a&gt;. It is an approachable academic rumination on the ‘reflective games’ of our past and present and the avenues they open for us as players. Bouncing off Highguard as I did, I was curious about Victor’s passages about shooter games and specifically anything that could help me cope with that geyser of frustration that comes in those tense moments, those moments that make me enter a new level of anti-zen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exploring the idea of a “Zen Shooter”, Navarro-Remesal discusses the technicolour, musical shooter Rez with developer Eddy Boxerman, whose work is very much of the same philosophical lineage as Tetsuya Mizuguchi’s. &lt;em&gt;“Zen games can use any mechanic as long as the player does not feel aggressive”&lt;/em&gt;. This is a fascinating typology for shooter games. Genres are typically beholden to mechanical properties: shooters are shooters because you shoot, platformers are platformers because you platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that this reappraisal of ‘zen games’ isolates a feeling in a non-prescriptive way; note that Boxerman didn’t say zen games relax you, they just don’t aggravate you.  And this leads me to where I am today and the shooter I’m finding a real sense of zen within, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/1920x1080.webp" alt="ss_ce498ed53cb16c8a081bb6c661564f51a744e259" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark Forces II is a classic FPS that operates within the Doom-mode. Each of the 21 stages is preceded by an incredibly chopped and earnest FMV cutscene with levels that have been designed by a team that takes their cues as much from M.C. Escher as they do I.D Software. There are a handful of enemies sprinkled across each level but they die without much fuss. The real magic is navigating these wonderfully intricate puzzle spaces. When I stop to pull up a projected map that sits on top of the FOV and hinders more than it helps, there is a palpable sense of calm that comes over me. The game world is still and so am I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing early PC shooters speaks to a type of play that modern FPS’ simply cannot provide. That ‘&lt;em&gt;ma&lt;/em&gt;’ in a &lt;a href='https://www.thetemptrack.com/2016/06/13/from-kurosawa-to-evangelion-ma-or-leaving-space-for-thought/' target='_blank'&gt;Japanese sense&lt;/a&gt; - translating to something like “space for thought”. ‘Ma’ is used in film to give action sequences meaning, a slow tracking shot of a landscape before a fight to remind the viewers what our characters are fighting over. These PC games of the 1990s, by design or restriction, provide these moments to reflect. This is what I need and what Highguard or Apex Legends cannot give me: the stillness that precedes the firefights. I'm starting to think that I’ve never wanted excitement, I’m unstuck in time seeking dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEIZURES NOT MADE BY VIRTUE OF DUE PROCESS</title>
      <link>https://killjoy.bearblog.dev/metroid-samus-is-a-cop-bounty-hunter/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_01-1.webp" alt="NintendoSwitch2_MetroidPrime4BeyondNintendoSwitchEdition_SCRN_01" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another state; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose. The seizure is not made by virtue of due process. None is needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States Supreme Court ruling on the rights of independent agents holding suspects, Taylor vs Taintor 1873.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all thinking a lot about policing lately. Good thing, too. I truly believe the best wards we have against a corrupt enforcement institution is preparing ourselves to build the next thing; to figure out how to feel safe in your community with what you have around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a blog about modern policing (mostly). You see, my annual rewatch of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; coincided with my playthrough of the disappointing but agreeable &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt;. The highly anticipated entry to the FPS iteration of Samus Aran’s adventures does away with the spookiness, isolation, and dynamic labyrinths that characterises Nintendo’s most ‘adult’ series in their stable. Instead, chatty NPCs abound! This guy does machines, this one is a strong-silent type, this one is a Samus super-fan. They just met Samus but they love Samus. Why? Don’t worry about it, she’s a hero and she’s cool, that’s all you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not enough for me, I’m afraid, &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt;. I’m going to need more. Prime 4 is largely disconnected from the goings-on of the wider galaxy, instead set in an extra-dimensional desert planet that is so gamic in its design that it resembles an escape room, not a mysterious alien planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My playthrough got me thinking about what Samus actually is. Master Chief is a soldier, Warhammer 40K’s Space Marines are soldiers, Samus - the third in this genetically-modified triptych - is not a soldier by any in-game account. She’s a ‘bounty hunter’. Now, this blog is not ‘Did You Know Gaming?’ but if you’ll indulge me some trivia, Samus was initially given a ‘Space Hunter’ honorific in the &lt;a href='https://www.gravelstudios.com/blog/mim/' target='_blank'&gt;Metroid (NES) manual&lt;/a&gt; with only later game paratext referring to her as a ‘Bounty Hunter’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/mim03.webp" alt="mim03" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Samus was part of the police force but decided to hand in her badge and arm-cannon to pursue an independent ‘hunter’. This allows for less oversight, more extrajudicial killings, and a more complicated tax return. This career change is apparently explained in Metroid Other M. A game I have not played, and I don't think I ever will. OH WELL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, while digging around the wikis, I found that Metroid lore boffs often refer to the Federation Police Force as a ‘military organisation’... it’s refreshing to call a spade a space.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/uf17pb/yoshio_sakamotos_comments_about_samus_being/' target='_blank'&gt;2004 interview with IGN&lt;/a&gt;, longtime Metroid director Yoshio Sakamoto addressed the ‘bounty hunter’ misnomer that had become a bit of a sticking point in the community. His explanation: cool vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/0_wnygifdh7bifvw8y.webp" alt="0_wNYGifDh7BifVw8Y" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncritically speaking, Bounty Hunters are cool. Rick Deckard is cool. Spike Spiegel is cool. Boba Fett is cool. Sakamoto is operating in the same mode as George Lucas did with Star Wars by pinching the archetypes of Spaghetti Westerns, except one step down the chain of derivation. Sakamoto is clear to state that the bounty hunting isn’t what defines her, and good thing too. Nintendo would be shocked to learn the torrid history of the first privateers that made their living hunting down freed slaves in the European colonies or, more recently, the Philippine military’s - with input from the US - deployment of &lt;a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-40168656#' target='_blank'&gt;$10 million bounties on the leaders of local terrorist organisation and ISIS-allied Maute Group&lt;/a&gt;. Not getting the Nintendo Seal of Quality on any of this stuff, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Samus was a cop, then became a bounty hunter - which we’ve established doesn’t mean what we think it means - so what is she? A mercenary? A paramilitary contractor?! That’s WAY worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m struggling to pull together a consistent concept of Samus’ role in the galaxy as an ally to Galactic Federation and operating without the requirement to follow due process or face accountability (hey, maybe she still is a cop). The inconsistency of verbiage points to a lack of care toward the Metroid series' worldbuilding writ large. A lack of care that leads to the ‘Prime Timeline’ where The Federation is positioned as the Goodies as opposed to an intergalactic network of bureaucrats and military arms with inscrutable agendas. Put succinctly by a &lt;a href='https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/524791-metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition/81080928?page=3' target='_blank'&gt;Gamefaqs user&lt;/a&gt;: “Mainline Metroid is about a bad Federation that Samus repeatedly butts heads with, while Prime is about a good Federation that Samus repeatedly works with”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/mfy5pxj08y261.webp" alt="mfy5pxj08y261" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is that the Metroid series is stuck between the hammer and the anvil. It wants to retain the prestige that the series carries but to do so would mean engaging with shifting cultural values around violence and the authoritarian figures wielding it. Even if your enemies are unnamed Space Pirates whose whole raison d'être is to yell, shoot, and die, Samus carries with her a politic that is inseparable from her vocation. Nintendo can’t deploy the term ‘Bounty Hunter’ without invoking all of its historical weight and how its usage today. For what it’s worth, this is not a Nintendo specific issue: videogame companies love playing toy soldiers but don’t want to engage with the history of their little plastic figurines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is Samus? Well if what she is what she does, she’s more of a bounty hunter than Nintendo would admit to, more of a cop than we should all be happy about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KILLJOY PRESENTS: THE BEST OF 2025</title>
      <link>https://killjoy.bearblog.dev/killjoy-presents-the-best-of-2025/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/setwidth800-despelote-background.webp" alt="SetWidth800-despelote-background" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August I had a conversation in the sweaty halls of Gamescom with a couple of journalists about the state of the games industry. We were bemoaning the ways in which the corporate presence is gutting our proverbial home for parts and polluting the culture in the process. We also discussed Brendan Keogh’s essential 2023 book &lt;a href='https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5572/The-Videogame-Industry-Does-Not-Exist-Why-We-Should' target='_blank'&gt;The Videogame Industry Does Not Exist&lt;/a&gt;. Early on, Keogh posits that we have reached an inflection point where we must consider the commercial ‘industry’ - both AAA and indie - as an independent sect to games culture writ large. The commercial juggernaut is one big part of it - a bloated, unavoidable part of it - but it is not all of games as a culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe a lot of the frustration with the games industry can be solved by compartmentalising it from one’s personal connection to the games form. Someone with a passion for nature journaling should not spend their energy concerned with the developments in deforestation technologies. The AAA games space shapes the culture but it is not its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a very helpful framework this year for codifying the (obviously) important issues plaguing games cultures with the wonderful games that rattled around my skull this year. Without further ado, here is the “killjoy best of 2025 list”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=despelote&gt;Despelote&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year’s true indie darling, Despelote’s greatest achievement has been stealthily asking indie game players to reflect about why football is called the Beautiful Game. Set during Ecuador's qualification for the 2002 World Cup, Despelote is a first-person adventure about experiencing that specific moment in cultural history from the perspective of an eight-year-old boy. The graphical style employs grainy photos of real-life locations to evoke the hazy fidelity of recalling childhood. My adoration for this wonderful, albeit short, game is that it is exemplary of what the future of independent games can be. It speaks to a very specific moment in time, from a very specific perspective and has the generosity to attempt to share that with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/7e50a090-26d8-11f0-bbff-ca4720dac5e2.webp" alt="7e50a090-26d8-11f0-bbff-ca4720dac5e2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=death-stranding-2&gt;Death Stranding 2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year was the year the word slop lost its power. It once was a perfect deployment of humour and judgement that could be trebucheted at any and all AI-generated tripe. But now it just means ‘type’. Anything that follows the pattern or trappings of any other thing: it’s slop. Which is great for pigs, who can’t tell the difference, but we can and we should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death Stranding 2 is as AAA as a game comes. It’s got an open world, a star-studded cast, a technically impressive visual suite and a price tag that goes with it. But it’s also a Kojima-directed design. My contention is that the games Koj puts his fingerprints on are the opposite of slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite definition of ‘slop’ comes from &lt;a href='http://maxread.substack.com/p/what-is-slop-exactly' target='_blank'&gt;Max Read&lt;/a&gt; that describes it in his newsletter: “Slop” is that which is 'fully optimized' to its domain to the point of texturelessness or characterlessness". Death Stranding 2 is so far from optimized, it’s almost funny. But in that lack of optimization: the completely uneven storytelling, the risk vs reward delivery gameplay, and the additional 30 hours that probably could have been cut - some of my favourite moments of any Kojima-directed game emerges. The smooth road feels good because you had to traverse the rough first, that’s the whole point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/19b7f8c469046-screenshoturl.webp" alt="19b7f8c469046-screenshotUrl" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=skate-story&gt;Skate Story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href='https://killjoy.bearblog.dev/i-hate-skateboarding/' target='_blank'&gt;"In Skate Story, skating is weaponised to defy arbitrary laws, written by invisible bureaucrats, enforced in places they don't even live."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/19b7f8c5ab51-screenshoturl.webp" alt="19b7f8c5ab51-screenshotUrl" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=hollow-knight-silksong&gt;Hollow Knight: Silksong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer I read a great &lt;a href='https://dl.digra.org/index.php/dl/article/download/2424/2417/2453' target='_blank'&gt;conference paper&lt;/a&gt; by Fabrizio Matarese from the University of Turin on the Dark Souls series and the ways it resonates with the philosophical tenants of stoicism. What struck me as notable was how Matarese positions the Dark Souls’ series challenging design as a deliberate process that is attempting to actively tempers the players’ psyche; to make them “insensitive to physical evil”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Cherry’s long awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong resonates with this idea to an even more extreme degree. The initial response to its unexpected difficulty perhaps speaks to a lack of mental tempering from its players - their expectations of their abilities mismatching what the game is asking of them. This is not a judgement and I’m not exempt from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as you progress through Pharloom’s swamp-mired underbelly (&lt;em&gt;fuck Bilewater, all my homies hate Bilewater&lt;/em&gt;), its corrupted cathedrals, and battle foes possessed by an increasing insensitivity to mercy, you learn to temper yourself. Each of Hornet’s moves becomes deliberate, each swipe calculated with a greater precision. A mantra I found myself repeating is the game isn’t punishing me, it wants me to succeed. And success doesn’t just mean rolling credits. Success is determined by one's ability to not let the doubts and frustration blind you to what is a masterpiece in psychological design. Through the management of my negative passions, to overcome my own fury and obscuring sensitivities is to see the game for its beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities&gt;Magic: the Gathering - Edge of Eternities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been a rough year for my favourite card game. For the past 30 years, Magic: the Gathering has been largely defined by its incomparable core gameplay and its tight adherence to a aesthetic quality - 'Magicness'. That 'Magicness' can be applied across the multiverse and genres - from the gothic horror of Innistrad to the middle ages war cultures of Central and East Asia in Tarkir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement of a space opera setting for the card game was met with raised eyebrows; especially amidst a 'Fortnite' inspired spree of BRAND INTERGRATIONS across 'Universe Beyond' sets. At the end of 2025, it's safe to say that Magic's take on science-fiction is extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seamlessly blending Magic's finicky identity with neo-fantasy aesthetics, and a dynamic suite of space-inspired mechanics - Edge of Eternities is a astronomical success. The designers took cues from the likes of Ann Leckie's 'Imperial Radch' series more than they did Star Trek and the result is a technicolour storm of novel science fiction. Nihilistic zealots are locked into centuries long wars with imperial monarchs, inter-dimensional beings weave across the galaxies for inscrutable reasons, and denizens of old empires attempt to find a new home in a galaxy that is being torn in two by entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress enough that this wildly complex world is all playing out across under 300 cards. Cards that may be forgotten as Magic's 2025 will be notarised as the year The Office's Dwight Schrute entered the Magic multiverse. From my vantage point, Edge of Eternities is the platonic ideal of 'Magicness' in a landscape where corporate interference is ripping the fantasy out of our game's reality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I HATE SKATEBOARDING.</title>
      <link>https://killjoy.bearblog.dev/i-hate-skateboarding/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/scht2x-2.webp" alt="scht2x" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earth is defiled by its people;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;they have disobeyed the laws,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;violated the statutes,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and broken the everlasting covenant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 24:4-6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skateboarding is an enterprise of ambition. The hobby begins the first time you see a person play footsie with gravity, launching themselves impossibly from earthly tether and planting themselves back on the ground with a clatter that imitates applause. Then you try skateboarding. And you’re young, maybe, so you don’t have full control of your mass and you fall. And you fall again. And you hit the ground like a bouncy ball until the time between the falls decreases enough to learn to work in tandem with momentum until you, your feet, the wood, and the concrete are in harmony. Your aspiration becomes manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passes, you grow up. At 29 you pick the board up again. Not old by any stretch of the imagination but your aspirations have changed and your bones have subsequently transmuted from rubber to glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='https://www.igdb.com/games/' target='_blank'&gt;Skate Story&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Eng and Devolver Digital is a game about wagering pain against aspiration. You are a demon made of glass and pain, the game narrates, that aspires to eat the moon, a celestial foe that maintains the eternal night. To do so, The Skater will grind, fliptrick, and rip through the layers of hell eating the seven coloured moons and claiming their soul back. Its story operates under dream logic but its mechanical underpinnings are firmly grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6j0zKSXAFE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the same control scheme as most skating games, Skate Story has an immaculate understanding of momentum and weight; closer to EA's early iterations of the &lt;em&gt;Skate&lt;/em&gt; series (more on that later) than Tony Hawk. However, the crucial context for &lt;em&gt;Skate Story&lt;/em&gt; is that skating is the only form of expression any denizen of hell has. The other citizenry across the layers are trapped in bespoke tortures ranging from reliving lost love to entrapment in a coffin that's made up to seem like heaven. In &lt;em&gt;Skate Story&lt;/em&gt;, skating is weaponised to defy arbitrary laws, written by invisible bureaucrats, enforced in places they don't even live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skating culture, historically speaking, has always been about the expression of autonomy. A reclaiming of public spaces as playgrounds or theatres of accomplishment. &lt;em&gt;Skate Story&lt;/em&gt; builds this into its conceit. The Skater is derided by the authorities for exercising their agency, for daring to aspire to something more meaningful than a torturous existence. But to do so, they endure great pain, illustrated by the shattering of glass as the demon fails to land a grind cleanly or clips a sharp wall at the end of a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skater persists because the culture demands it. At one low moment where they declare "I HATE SKATEBOARDING" slumped over themselves on a steel chair a la &lt;a href='https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/18901/when-does-this-image-of-shinji-ikari-sitting-in-a-folding-chair-appear' target='_blank'&gt;Shinji Ikari&lt;/a&gt;. The declaration of misdirected hate eventually is turned toward the appropriate authority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I will crawl through my own glass shards. I will scrape the joy from this infernal sewer. I will burn the brambles around my soul"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is what skating is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/hateskate.webp" alt="hateskate" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the letter of the law, skateboarding is legal in public spaces in the UK. However, society's internalised derision of young people exercising their own freedoms can often spawn ad-hoc community support officers out of citizens with a wonky sense of justice. But skating in the face of this judgement has always &lt;a href='https://tmrwmagazine.com/en/news/meet-the-hackney-collectiveredefining-the-skate-scene' target='_blank'&gt;galvanised the culture&lt;/a&gt;: aspiring to greatness, to build community in spite of whatever covenants are being used to restrict the pasttime. Skating does not defile the land anymore than the law protects it. Blow it out your arse, Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skate Story&lt;/em&gt; embodies this struggle and the pain associated with it. 2025's other skating offering, EA's free-to-play Skate, is more interested in presenting a sedate, corporatised vision of skateboarding imagined by, as &lt;a href='https://aftermath.site/ea-skate-review-impressions/' target='_blank'&gt;Luke Plunkett wrote for Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;, "a theater kid improvising as a serial Linkedin poster".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/killjoy/skate.webp" alt="skate" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EA's &lt;em&gt;Skate&lt;/em&gt; is set in a North American skate utopia where everyone is a competent skater and, paradoxically, there is technology developed to ensure that everyone is protected from any pain or damage or any sense of risk or excitement. Remember what we said about skate culture being defined by circumventing permission structures? Remember what we said about the importance of pain as symbolic of aspiration? Forget that! What if skate culture was instead about consumption!? That's the vision of the hobby that most players are encountering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skate Story&lt;/em&gt; understands that skating is about expression, autonomy and accomplishment more than it is its aesthetic trappings. I can't think of a more powerful focaliser of autonomy than seeing a glass demon laser-flipping off a manual pad into a perfect bank, but that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;
