      <title>India tells global tech platforms to follow constitution after tougher content rules</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973917/india-tells-global-tech-platforms-to-follow-constitution-after-tougher-content-rules</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India’s information minister said on Tuesday that big tech platforms like Google’s YouTube, Meta, X and Netflix must operate within the country’s constitutional framework, a week after New Delhi &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972281"&gt;tightened its content-takedown rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comments came on the sidelines of an artificial intelligence summit in Delhi, where top executives from global AI giants will join several world leaders this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important for the multinationals to understand the cultural context of the country in which they are operating,” Ashwini Vaishnaw said during a briefing at the India AI Impact Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, India said social media companies will have to remove unlawful content within three hours of being notified, tightening an earlier 36-hour timeline, in what could be a compliance challenge for Meta, YouTube and X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a need for much stronger regulation on deepfakes, Vaishnaw said, adding that a dialogue has already been initiated with the industry on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is mounting global pressure on social media companies to police content more aggressively, with governments from Brussels to Brasilia demanding faster takedowns and greater accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Spain ordered prosecutors to investigate social media platforms X, Meta and TikTok for allegedly spreading AI-generated child sexual abuse material, as European regulators intensify scrutiny of big tech over harmful and illegal content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ramazan moon sighted in Saudi Arabia, UAE</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973918/ramazan-moon-sighted-in-saudi-arabia-uae</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ramazan moon was sighted in &lt;a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/saudi-arabia-confirms-first-day-of-ramadan-1.500446178"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/ramadan/ramadan-2026-uae-confirms-first-day-after-crescent-moon-sighting-1.500446056"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday night, according to &lt;em&gt;Gulf News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate reports, the publication said that Wednesday (Feb 18) would be the first day of the holy month in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official &lt;em&gt;Saudi Press Agency&lt;/em&gt; also said on X that Wednesday would be the first day of the holy month in the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tolo News&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, also announced that Ramazan would begin on February 18 in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a statement issued by the Supreme Court, it said that in the provinces of Parwan, Kandahar, Helmand, and Zabul, a large number of people sighted the crescent moon of Ramadan and reported it to the Sharia courts,” it said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/TOLONewsEnglish/status/2023786298050593228'&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia’s Gulf neighbours Oman, Qatar and the UAE also made similar announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972917"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;that the first day of Ramazan in Pakistan “likely to fall” on February 19 (Thursday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the agency said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that a meeting of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will be held tomorrow at the Auqaf Department building in Peshawar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a notification issued by the religious affairs ministry, zonal and district committee meetings will also be held at their respective headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The chairman Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will announce the decision of moon sighting or otherwise subsequently on the basis of information received to this end,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iran FM says agreed with US ‘on guiding principles’ for deal</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973912/iran-fm-says-agreed-with-us-on-guiding-principles-for-deal</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday the latest talks with the United States saw them agree on “a set of guiding principles” that would pave the way for a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we were able to reach broad agreement on a set of guiding principles, based on which we will move forward and begin working on the text of a potential agreement,” Araghchi told state TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can say that, compared with the previous round, fully serious discussions were raised and the atmosphere was more constructive,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tehran and Washington held on Tuesday a second round of negotiations — which &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1971383"&gt;began &lt;/a&gt;earlier this month — after talks last year collapsed following Israel’s &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1916899/iran-says-israel-attack-declaration-of-war-following-strikes-on-nuclear-facilities-missile-factories"&gt;attack &lt;/a&gt;on Iran in June, which triggered a 12-day war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That war saw the United States briefly join Israel with strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest talks were held after Washington deployed an &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1969198"&gt;aircraft carrier group&lt;/a&gt; to the Middle East following Iran’s deadly &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1968309"&gt;crackdown &lt;/a&gt;last month on anti-government protests, first sparked by economic hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interview with state TV, Araghchi said the two sides have begun a path towards an agreement, but noted that “this does not mean we can reach a deal quickly”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope this process can be completed as soon as possible and we are ready to devote sufficient time to it,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that it “will take time to narrow” the gap between the positions of both sides, “but at least we now have a set of guiding principles and a clearer path to move forward on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="khamenei-says-us-will-not-succeed-in-destroying-iran" href="#khamenei-says-us-will-not-succeed-in-destroying-iran" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khamenei says US ‘will not succeed’ in destroying Iran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one of his recent speeches, the US president said that for 47 years America has not succeeded in destroying the Islamic republic … I tell you: you will not succeed either,” Khamenei said in a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his speech, Khamenei warned that the US warship deployed in the Gulf could be sunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We constantly hear that they have sent a warship towards Iran. A warship is certainly a dangerous weapon, but even more dangerous is the weapon capable of sinking it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khamenei expressed skepticism over the outcome of the negotiations with the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there are to be negotiations — because there is no real room for negotiation — determining the outcome of the negotiations in advance is a mistake and madness,” he said, referring to US calls for Iran to abandon its nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The statements of the American president, at times threatening and at times dictating what should and should not be done, reveal a desire to dominate the Iranian nation,” Khamenei said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tarique Rahman sworn in as Bangladesh’s PM after landslide election victory</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973874/tarique-rahman-sworn-in-as-bangladeshs-pm-after-landslide-election-victory</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259"&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as Bangladesh’s prime minister on Tuesday, marking a decisive political shift in the South Asian nation after his party’s sweeping parliamentary &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890"&gt;election victory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and assassinated President Ziaur Rahman, takes office facing urgent challenges, including restoring political stability, rebuilding investor confidence, and reviving key industries such as the garment sector after the prolonged turmoil that followed the &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245"&gt;Gen Z-led uprising&lt;/a&gt; that toppled &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1955643"&gt;Sheikh Hasina’s&lt;/a&gt; government in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus ran the country through the transitional period leading up to the election.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven' data-original-src='https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4Bc3_hG8IVM'&gt;
        &lt;div class='media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative'&gt;    &lt;div style="position: relative; aspect-ratio: 9 / 16; overflow: hidden; max-width: 360px; margin: auto"&gt;
        &lt;iframe
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Bc3_hG8IVM?enablejsapi=1&amp;controls=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0"
            style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;"

            allowfullscreen
        &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking with tradition, the swearing-in ceremony was held under the open sky at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, the national parliament building, instead of the Bangabhaban, the president’s official residence, where such events are usually organised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Mohammed Shahabuddin officiated as Rahman and his cabinet took their oaths in the presence of senior political figures, diplomats, civil and military officials, and representatives from invited countries, including China, India and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority, returning to power after nearly two decades. The Jamaat-i-Islami, contesting its first election since a 2013 ban was lifted following Hasina’s ouster, won a record 68 seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party was banned from contesting after its registration was revoked by the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat and its allies, including the National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a prominent role in the movement that toppled Hasina, will form the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven' data-original-src='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973905/bangladeshs-new-prime-minister-political-heir-tarique-rahman'&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s elevation caps a long and turbulent political journey. He returned to Bangladesh last year after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, arriving shortly before his mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivals have long criticised his political record, pointing to corruption allegations he denies, but his return energised party supporters and reshaped the BNPs campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his first remarks after the election, Rahman urged calm and restraint, saying: Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called on supporters to avoid retaliation, warning: We will not tolerate any kind of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Rahman and lawmakers were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850190"&gt;deadly&lt;/a&gt; 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850304"&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="peaceful-opposition" href="#peaceful-opposition" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Peaceful opposition’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s win marks a remarkable turnaround, with the BNP coalition winning 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven' data-original-src='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971510'&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament — a four-fold increase on its previous best — has challenged results in 32 constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven per cent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the BNP can do a good job with the economy, it will make everything else easier for the government,” Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will help to create a level of stability, to tackle the many other challenges beyond the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="pakistan-congratulates-rahman" href="#pakistan-congratulates-rahman" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pakistan congratulates Rahman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Rahman’s oath-taking, President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated him on becoming the prime minister and his party on its “decisive victory” in the elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post by the President’s Secretariat on social media platform X said Zardari also appreciated the interim government’s role “in a peaceful [and] fair election” and conveyed “best wishes for stability and prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president “hopes for stronger Pakistan-Bangladesh ties and regional peace”, the post said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended warm felicitations to Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to close and meaningful engagements with my brother, to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation across mutually beneficial areas and to deepen the historic ties between our two countries,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/CMShehbaz/status/2023777028638675173'&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who was visiting Dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony, conveyed best wishes and prayers for Rahman in “steering the country towards new heights of progress and development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was an honour to witness and be part of this historic moment in the history of Bangladesh on behalf of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the people of Pakistan,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/betterpakistan/status/2023726098761326908'&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iqbal also met Rahman after the latter’s oath-taking, with a PID press release stating that the Pakistani minister conveyed “warm congratulations on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan” to the new prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He extended best wishes for the peace, progress and prosperity of Bangladesh under Rahman’s leadership, the press release said, adding that during the meeting, Iqbal also conveyed a formal invitation from the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Rahman to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two leaders discussed avenues to reinvigorate bilateral relations and enhance regional cooperation,” the press release further stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Iqbal emphasised the need to revive SAARC to promote regional connectivity and advance a shared geo-economic vision for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that South Asia has remained one of the least integrated regions due to historical conflicts, and underscored that Pakistan and Bangladesh, through mutual collaboration, could help pave the way for a more integrated and economically vibrant South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the importance of knowledge partnerships, Iqbal proposed the establishment of a “Pakistan–Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor” to strengthen academic, research and technological collaboration, the press release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He informed Rahman that the Chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan would be directed to visit Bangladesh to explore twin-university agreements and promote student and faculty exchange programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iqbal stressed that youth exchange “is crucial for building long-term partnerships” and announced enhanced academic cooperation, including scholarship opportunities. He said that 500 scholarships had been allocated for Bangladeshi students, with 75 students already proceeding to Pakistan for higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides also discussed collaboration between institutions including the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), and their Bangladeshi counterparts to exchange expertise in data systems, digital governance, and institutional capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iqbal further highlighted opportunities for cooperation in SMEs and cottage industries, noting that by leveraging their combined populations, Pakistan and Bangladesh could secure a greater share in global markets for technology-enabled services, manufacturing, and production of goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding direct flight operations and improving connectivity were also discussed as important steps to facilitate trade, tourism, business-to-business engagement, and people-to-people contacts, the press release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Iqbal also proposed the revival of the Iqbal Academy and suggested joint celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of Allama Muhammad Iqbal next year, as a symbol of shared intellectual and cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and working together for regional peace, stability, and shared prosperity, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the minister had met with Mohammad Yunus, who was serving as the country’s interim leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I warmly congratulated Professor Yunus and the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of elections and the historic democratic transition. I conveyed Pakistan’s sincere good wishes for continued stability, progress, and prosperity for Bangladesh under its new leadership,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/betterpakistan/status/2023655329654075531'&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further said that the discussions focused on “opening a new, forward-looking chapter in Pakistan–Bangladesh relations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I expressed appreciation for the positive momentum in bilateral ties, including growing trade engagement, revival of direct air connectivity, and renewed people-to-people contacts. We agreed that the current regional and geopolitical environment demands greater economic cooperation, connectivity, and collaboration between our two countries,” Iqbal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also acknowledged Yunus’s global contributions to social entrepreneurship and inclusive development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I extended an invitation for him to visit Pakistan so that we may further institutionalise cooperation in areas of shared interest, particularly youth empowerment, innovation, and sustainable development,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan and Bangladesh share deep cultural, historical, and social affinities. It is time to transform these affinities into structured economic partnerships, academic exchanges, and regional cooperation. Our future lies in building connectivity, expanding trade, empowering youth, and shaping a stable and prosperous South Asia together,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Rahman, 60, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and assassinated President Ziaur Rahman, takes office facing urgent challenges, including restoring political stability, rebuilding investor confidence, and reviving key industries such as the garment sector after the prolonged turmoil that followed the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245">Gen Z-led uprising</a> that toppled <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1955643">Sheikh Hasina’s</a> government in 2024.</p>
<p>An interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus ran the country through the transitional period leading up to the election.</p>

<p>Breaking with tradition, the swearing-in ceremony was held under the open sky at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, the national parliament building, instead of the Bangabhaban, the president’s official residence, where such events are usually organised.</p>
<p>President Mohammed Shahabuddin officiated as Rahman and his cabinet took their oaths in the presence of senior political figures, diplomats, civil and military officials, and representatives from invited countries, including China, India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Rahman’s BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority, returning to power after nearly two decades. The Jamaat-i-Islami, contesting its first election since a 2013 ban was lifted following Hasina’s ouster, won a record 68 seats.</p>
<p>Hasina’s Awami League party was banned from contesting after its registration was revoked by the Election Commission.</p>
<p>Jamaat and its allies, including the National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a prominent role in the movement that toppled Hasina, will form the opposition.</p>

<p>Rahman’s elevation caps a long and turbulent political journey. He returned to Bangladesh last year after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, arriving shortly before his mother’s death.</p>
<p>Rivals have long criticised his political record, pointing to corruption allegations he denies, but his return energised party supporters and reshaped the BNPs campaign.</p>
<p>In his first remarks after the election, Rahman urged calm and restraint, saying: Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost.</p>
<p>He called on supporters to avoid retaliation, warning: We will not tolerate any kind of chaos.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Rahman and lawmakers were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850190">deadly</a> 2024 <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850304">uprising</a>.</p>

Our future lies in building connectivity, expanding trade, empowering youth, and shaping a stable and prosperous South Asia together,” he said.</p>

      <title>8 Muslim nations, including Pakistan, condemn Israeli move to claim West Bank land as ‘state property’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, on Tuesday condemned the Israeli &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973604/israel-moves-to-claim-west-bank-land-as-state-property"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; to claim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property”, saying that the step reflected an attempt to “impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reported on Sunday that the Israeli government had approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/joint-statement-by-the-foreign-ministers-of-pakistan-egypt-jordan-uae-indonesia-turkiye-saudi-arabia-qatar-condemning-israels-illegal-decision-of-designation-and-occupation-of-occupied-west-bank-as-state-land-and-illegal-settlement-activity-2"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; issued on Tuesday, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar strongly condemned the Israeli move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” the joint statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ministers affirm that these measures represent a flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as a violation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, foremost among them Resolution 2334,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision also contradicts the advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice concerning the legal consequences arising from Israeli policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which underscored the illegality of measures intended to alter the legal, historical, and demographic status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the obligation to end the occupation, and the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force,” the joint statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministers added that this step reflected an attempt to “impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that the same eight countries had worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1944220"&gt;&lt;u&gt;plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Pakistan had released a separate statement &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973650"&gt;condemning &lt;/a&gt;the Israeli move, calling on the international community to reject its actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973805"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan had also separately criticised the move as illegal while the European Union had called on Tel Aviv to reverse the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India court clears mega project on ecologically sensitive Great Nicobar island</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973881/india-court-clears-mega-project-on-ecologically-sensitive-great-nicobar-island</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India’s environmental court has given the go-ahead to the strategically significant Great Nicobar infrastructure project despite widespread concerns of ecological damage to the island in the Andaman Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Green Tribunal on Monday dismissed a batch of petitions objecting to the mega project on ecologically sensitive Great Nicobar island, saying “adequate safeguards” had been taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure plan involves building a transhipment port, airport, power plant and a township on the island, located close to the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is looking to pour billions of dollars into connecting the island to global trade routes, after the project was granted initial environmental approvals in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s environment minister last September called it a project of “strategic, defence and national importance” which would transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://v"&gt;Andaman&lt;/a&gt; and Nicobar archipelago has also long been seen within India as key to countering China’s growing influence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But activists say the infrastructure drive may adversely impact the ecology of the island, result in the felling of hundreds of thousands of trees and harm the interests of local tribal groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nicobarese community has expressed fears over the dispossession of their ancestral land, which was devastated in the 2004 tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmaker Jairam Ramesh from the opposition Congress party called the tribunal’s approval “deeply disappointing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is clear evidence that the project will have disastrous ecological impacts,” he said in a post on X, warning of “long-term consequences”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>France’s Macron eyes Rafale fighter jet deal in India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973870/frances-macron-eyes-rafale-fighter-jet-deal-in-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;French President Emmanuel Macron begins a three-day visit to India on Tuesday, with talks focused on artificial intelligence cooperation and a potential multibillion-dollar Dassault Rafale fighter jet deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France is seeking to expand its military partnership with New Delhi, with discussions expected on a potential contract for 114 additional French fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macron and his wife Brigitte arrived around midnight on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, for his fourth visit to India since taking office in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macron will then travel to New Delhi for an artificial intelligence summit on Wednesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit follows New Delhi’s confirmation last week that it intends to place a major order for Rafale jets, as well as the signing of a landmark free trade agreement between India and the European Union in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="contract-of-the-century" href="#contract-of-the-century" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Contract of the century’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Delhi has sought over the past decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment, turning to other countries while also pushing for more domestic production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Indian defence ministry statement last week said the proposed purchase of Rafale jets had been cleared, with “the majority” of them to be manufactured in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement did not specify the exact number of jets New Delhi would purchase, but a New Delhi defence ministry source said that 114 was likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christophe Jaffrelot, an India specialist at Sciences Po Center for International Studies in Paris, described the potential $35 billion deal for 114 Rafales as the “contract of the century” and a potential “crowning achievement” for bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If finalised, the jets would add to the 36 Rafales India purchased for its air force in 2016 and 26 it has ordered for its navy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations over the additional aircraft still need to be concluded with manufacturer Dassault Aviation, but the French presidency has voiced optimism that what it calls a “historic” agreement could be reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="good-chemistry" href="#good-chemistry" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Good chemistry’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi and Macron will also inaugurate on Tuesday India’s first helicopter final assembly line via videoconference from Mumbai, a joint venture between India’s Tata Group and Airbus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/narendramodi/status/2023602806096359895'&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility in Vemagal, in the southern state of Karnataka near the tech hub of Bengaluru, will manufacture the Airbus H125, the company’s best-selling single-engine helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has emerged as one of India’s most important defence and economic partners in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through this visit, we seek to further strengthen cooperation” with India, and to “diversify” France’s economic and trade partnerships, Macron’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India, the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion people, is on track to become the fourth-largest economy globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s talks are also expected to address global economic uncertainty triggered by tariff policies under US President Donald Trump, as well as China’s influence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi’s office said discussions would focus on “cementing the strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilateral trade between France and India, driven largely by defence and aerospace — India’s commercial fleet includes a substantial number of Airbus aircraft — stands at around $18 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French foreign direct investment in India totals nearly $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two leaders will also be keen to nurture close personal ties.&lt;br&gt;“There is apparently a good chemistry, a good personal rapport,” Jaffrelot said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sensitive issue remains Ukraine: India has not condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion and has continued buying oil from Moscow.&lt;br&gt;US President Donald Trump has said India had committed to halting the purchases, though that has not been formally confirmed by New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the Indians stop buying Russian oil, they won’t be blamed for abstaining at the UN,” Jaffrelot added.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The two leaders will also be keen to nurture close personal ties.<br>“There is apparently a good chemistry, a good personal rapport,” Jaffrelot said.</p>

      <title>Trump says he will be involved indirectly in Iran talks</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973872/trump-says-he-will-be-involved-indirectly-in-iran-talks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be involved “indirectly” in high-stakes talks between Iran and the US over Tehran’s nuclear program set for Tuesday in Geneva, adding he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they’ll be very important,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2023574440848560343'&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran has long sought a tough posture in negotiations but learned the consequences of that approach last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate.&lt;br&gt;“I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="washington-pushes-tehran-to-forego-enrichment" href="#washington-pushes-tehran-to-forego-enrichment" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Washington pushes Tehran to forego enrichment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the US strikes in June, US-Iran nuclear talks had stalled over Washington’s demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,” Trump said, referring to the bat-winged US stealth bombers that carried out the bombings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope they’re going to be more reasonable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarks contrast with those by the US president on Friday, when he embraced potential regime change in Iran and lamented decades of failed talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X that he was in Geneva to “achieve a fair and equitable deal.” “What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araqchi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="questions-about-uranium-stockpile" href="#questions-about-uranium-stockpile" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Questions about uranium stockpile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kg of highly enriched uranium following Israeli-US strikes and let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed in June last year: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against any attack, which would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran held a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, which have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Trump’s comments about Iran seeking a deal, the talks face major potential stumbling blocks. Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues such as Iran’s missile stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and won’t accept zero uranium enrichment. It says its missile capabilities are off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking during a visit to Hungary on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that there’s an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement … but I don’t want to overstate it either,” Rubio said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be hard. It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UN calls on Israel to reverse unlawful West Bank actions
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973805/un-calls-on-israel-to-reverse-unlawful-west-bank-actions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Pakistan asks international community to reject provocative decision allowing takeover of occupied land as state property&lt;br&gt;• EU calls annexation illegal, Arab nations denounce ‘threat to peace efforts’&lt;br&gt;• Israel imposes restrictions, deploys police around Al-Aqsa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM / ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan&lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973650/pakistan-condemns-israels-move-to-convert-areas-of-west-bank-into-state-property"&gt; denounced &lt;/a&gt;the latest Israeli move to convert areas of the West Bank into “state property”, the UN chief called upon Tel Aviv to reverse its new, “unlawful” policy allowing registration of the occupied land in the occupied territory as state property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also denounced the step as a clear violation of international law as well as relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Islamabad urged the international community to reject the decision, said a statement issued by the For­eign Office spokesperson. It added that the occupying power continued to disregard international law and its provocative actions undermined the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Undermine peace efforts’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan also criticised the move as illegal. The measure is “aimed at impo­sing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank” that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s King Abdullah II said the actions “undermine efforts to restore calm and thr­e­aten to exacerbate the conflict,” according to a statement released by the royal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move. “This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control,” EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. “We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli anti-settlement watc­­h­dog Peace Now called the measure a “mega land grab”. Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO’s co-director, told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that the move would attribute new resources for land registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it,” Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership was likely to be used against Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it’s not theirs under this new registration process,” he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right’s annexation agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing demography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palesti­nian state, but many on Israel’s religious right want to take over the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Israeli initiatives come in the wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a recent statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump has opposed Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, saying stability in the territory helps keep Israel secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he has held off from dire­ctly criticising the new Israeli measures, despite the international outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around three million Palestinians live in the territory, which Israel has occupied since 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al-Aqsa restrictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli police said Monday that they would &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973712/israel-police-to-deploy-around-al-aqsa-for-ramazan-palestinians-report-curbs"&gt;deploy&lt;/a&gt; in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Islam’s third-holiest site. Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, adding that thousands of police would also be on duty for Friday prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nearly 70 rights groups slam EU migration policy
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973786/nearly-70-rights-groups-slam-eu-migration-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS: Nearly 70 groups hit out on Monday at EU &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972438"&gt;reforms&lt;/a&gt; to migration currently under consideration by the European Parliament, comparing them to US policy under President Donald Trump and calling on officials to abandon the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This threat is real and immediate,” the wide array of associations, including European and national rights groups, said in a letter expressing concern over police raids of public and private spaces, and racial profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want to oblige member states to ‘detect’ undocumented people — turning everyday spaces, public services, and community interactions into tools of &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1967038"&gt;ICE-style&lt;/a&gt; immigration enforcement,” they warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the United States. But raids by heavily armed, masked officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other agencies have sparked &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1970298"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; in Democratic-run cities, followed by violent crackdowns, including &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1965800"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1969081"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; where American citizens were shot dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We cannot be outraged by ICE in the United States while also supporting these practices in Europe,” said Michele LeVoy of PICUM, an organisation which protects undocumented migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration reform pushed by the European Commission allows the creation of centres outside the EU’s borders for rejected asylum seekers, so-called “return hubs”. Under the reform, there would be harsher sanctions on those who refuse to leave European territory, including longer periods of detention and the confiscation of identity documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures have already been approved by most EU states, but are condemned by the left in the European Parliament and migrant protection groups. The EU executive regularly rejects rights groups’ criticism, insisting its measures respect migrants’ fundamental human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brussels also says such actions are supported by a majority of citizens in Europe, where the political centre of gravity has shifted to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The measures have already been approved by most EU states, but are condemned by the left in the European Parliament and migrant protection groups. The EU executive regularly rejects rights groups’ criticism, insisting its measures respect migrants’ fundamental human rights.</p>
<p>Brussels also says such actions are supported by a majority of citizens in Europe, where the political centre of gravity has shifted to the right.</p>

      <title>Israel police to deploy around Al-Aqsa for Ramazan, Palestinians report curbs</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973712/israel-police-to-deploy-around-al-aqsa-for-ramazan-palestinians-report-curbs</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Israeli police said on Monday that they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during the holy month of Ramazan, which begins this week, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al-Aqsa — Islam’s third-holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, and in the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said thousands of police personnel would also be on duty for Friday prayers, which draw the largest crowds of worshippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not say whether age limits would apply, adding that the final number of people would be decided by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said in a separate statement it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55 and women over 50, mirroring last year’s criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Israeli authorities had blocked the Waqf — the Jordanian-run body administering the site — from carrying out routine preparations, including installing shade structures and setting up temporary medical clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Waqf source confirmed the restrictions and said 33 of its employees had been barred from entering the compound in the week before Ramazan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Al-Aqsa compound is a central symbol of Palestinian identity and also a frequent flashpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under long-standing arrangements, Jews may visit the compound, but they are not permitted to pray there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel says it is committed to maintaining this status quo, though Palestinians fear it is being eroded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braverman reiterated on Monday that no changes were planned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Outrage over US Congressman’s anti-Muslim remarks</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973779/outrage-over-us-congressmans-anti-muslim-remarks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: A fresh controversy over anti-Muslim rhetoric has erupted in the United States after Florida Republican Congressman Randy Fine posted a remark on social media, comparing Muslims to dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comment prompted condemnation from civil rights groups and a call for his resignation, which was also endorsed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; and other US media outlets reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one,” Mr Fine wrote on X on Sunday, in response to an online debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment quickly drew nationwide criticism, with Mr Newsom responding: “Resign now, you racist slob.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/2023293113561973183'&gt;

        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/2023293113561973183"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation in North America, urged both Republican and Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives to condemn the remarks and seek Mr Fine’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group described the statement as dehumanising and part of a broader pattern of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAIR said the lawmaker had in recent days labelled “Palestinian” identity as evil and had previously called for the destruction of what he termed “mainstream Muslims” as well as for the deportation of Muslims from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organisation characterised such statements as an explicit call for violence and warned they could contribute to rising discrimination against American Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest post was made during an online exchange linked to comments by New York-based activist Nerdeen Kiswani about dogs as indoor pets. While Kiswani later said her own remarks were intended as a joke, critics said Fine’s response crossed a dangerous line by invoking a comparison widely viewed as dehumanising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, however, has defended his position and said he is “not afraid” of being labelled Islamophobic. He is also associated with a newly formed congressional group that says it is working to counter what it describes as the growing influence of Sharia, or Islamic religious law, in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican lawmaker, who previously served in the Florida legislature and entered Congress after receiving an endorsement from President Donald Trump, has faced repeated condemnation from Democrats, civil rights organisations and some Jewish groups over his past statements on Muslims and the Gaza conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier move reflecting tensions on Capitol Hill, Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar had sought action against Fine, citing what she called a longstanding pattern of hateful rhetoric directed at Muslim lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Monday afternoon, House Republican leadership had not announced any disciplinary action, but calls for Fine to step down continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Britain needs to step up defence spending faster, says Starmer
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973785/britain-needs-to-step-up-defence-spending-faster-says-starmer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON: Britain should step up and accelerate its defence spending, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, following a report that the government was considering bringing forward its target to spend 3pc of economic output on defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain, which has warned of the risks posed by Russia, said in February 2025 that it would lift annual defence spending to 2.5pc of GDP by 2027 and aim for 3pc in the next parliament, which is expected to begin after an election due in 2029.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; reported that the government was now exploring ways to reach the 3pc target by 2029. It said no decision had been taken but the government recognised current plans would not cover rising defence costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he would bring the target forward to 2029, Starmer echoed comments he made at the &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973116"&gt;Munich Security Conference&lt;/a&gt;, where he said Europe had united to support Ukraine with the supply of weapons and munitions and to strengthen military readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to step up. That means on defence spending, we need to go faster,” Starmer told reporters on Monday. “We’ve obviously made commitments already in relation to that, but it goes beyond just how much you spend.” Latest Nato estimates show that Britain spent 2.3pc of GDP on defence in 2024, above the alliance’s 2pc guideline. But like other European countries, it has faced US pressure to spend more to protect the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggling with high debt and spending commitments, the government last year cut its international aid budget in order to fund the hike in defence spending to 2.5pc of GDP but is yet to publish an investment plan with spending priorities, something that has frustrated the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Drone attack on Sudan market kills 28
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973776/drone-attack-on-sudan-market-kills-28</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KHARTOUM: A drone attack on a crowded market in central Sudan killed 28 people, a rights group reported on Monday, as the army and its paramilitary rivals traded aerial strikes in their battle for territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack occurred in a paramilitary-controlled area in the far north of Sudan’s Kordofan region, currently the fiercest frontline in the three-year-old war between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Emergency Lawyers, a group monitoring atrocities in the conflict, several drones hit the al-Safiya market outside the town of Sodari in North Kordofan on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The attack occurred when the market was bustling with civilians, including women, children and the elderly,” the group said, adding that the toll was preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gave no indication of who carried out the strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodari, a remote town where desert trade routes cross, is around 230 kilometres (132 miles) northwest of El-Obeid, the state capital of North Kordofan, which the RSF has been trying to encircle for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kordofan region has seen a surge in deadly &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1959884/several-killed-in-drone-strikes-on-sudan-kindergarten-hospital"&gt;drone attacks&lt;/a&gt; as both sides fight over the country’s vital east-west axis, which links the western RSF-held region of Darfur, through El-Obeid, to the army-controlled capital Khartoum and the rest of Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across vast stretches of territory, attacks by both sides — many on remote towns and villages — have killed up to dozens of civilians at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Wednesday, two children were killed and a dozen wounded in one strike on a school, while another severely damaged a United Nations warehouse storing famine relief supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After consolidating their hold on Darfur last year, the RSF has pushed east through oil- and gold-rich Kordofan, in an attempt to seize Sudan’s central corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since April 2023, the war between the army and the &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1969266"&gt;RSF&lt;/a&gt; has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced around 11 million, creating the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also effectively split the country in two, with the army holding the centre, north and east while the RSF controls the west and, with their allies, parts of the south.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Indonesia readies 8,000 troops for Gaza international force
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973801/indonesia-readies-8000-troops-for-gaza-international-force</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Italy offers to train Gaza police force; EU, Rome to attend Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ meeting but limit participation&lt;br&gt;• Trump announces $5bn in pledges for Gaza reconstruction ahead of Washington summit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA: Indonesia is preparing a total of 8,000 troops for potential deployment to Gaza by June as part of a proposed multinational peacekeeping force but the final decision on deployment rests with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, the country’s army spokesperson said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Army spokesperson Donny Pram­ono noted that initially 1,000 soldiers would be ready for deployment by early April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The departure schedule rema­ins entirely subject to the political decisions of the state and applicable international mechanisms,” Pra­mono said in a text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s foreign ministry clarified on Saturday that its military’s participation in the UN-mandated International Stabilisation Force should not be interpreted as a normalisation of political relations with Israel, a nation Jakarta does not recognise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment would carry a non-combatant, humanitarian mandate and requires the consent of the Palestinian Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indonesia consistently rejects all attempts at demographic change or the forced displacement or relocation of the Palestinian people in any form,” the ministry said, adding that its troops would have no mandate to demilitarise any party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment plans are being announced as global leaders convene for the inaugural &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1971859"&gt;Board of Peace meeting&lt;/a&gt;, which will be chai­red by US President Donald Trump. Additionally, President Subianto is set to travel to Washington this week to participate in the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the board was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution to oversee the Gaza truce, the European Union insisted on Monday that while it will participate in the meeting, Brussels would not be joining as a member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica will represent the bloc in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She will participate in the meeting of the Board of Peace for the specific part dedicated to Gaza. Let me stress that the European Commission, it’s not becoming a member to the Board of Peace,” EU spokesman Guillaume Mercier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some member states have raised concerns that the board could morph into a rival to the UN. “We still have a number of questions regarding several elements in the Board of Peace: one concerning its scope, two concerning its governance, and three, its compatibility with the UN Charter,” EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Italy aims to play a role in &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1948828"&gt;stabilising&lt;/a&gt; the Middle East by offering training support while their Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed Rome is ready to participate as an observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are ready to train a new Gaza police force, and we are also ready to train a Palestinian police force,” Tajani told a news conference in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the summit, President Trump announced that members of the US-led body have pledged more than $5 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction and committed thousands of personnel to international stabilisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump plans to host the meeting on Feb 19 at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>JAKARTA: Indonesia is preparing a total of 8,000 troops for potential deployment to Gaza by June as part of a proposed multinational peacekeeping force but the final decision on deployment rests with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, the country’s army spokesperson said on Monday.</p>
<p>Army spokesperson Donny Pram­ono noted that initially 1,000 soldiers would be ready for deployment by early April.</p>
<p>“The departure schedule rema­ins entirely subject to the political decisions of the state and applicable international mechanisms,” Pra­mono said in a text message.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s foreign ministry clarified on Saturday that its military’s participation in the UN-mandated International Stabilisation Force should not be interpreted as a normalisation of political relations with Israel, a nation Jakarta does not recognise.</p>
<p>The deployment would carry a non-combatant, humanitarian mandate and requires the consent of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>“Indonesia consistently rejects all attempts at demographic change or the forced displacement or relocation of the Palestinian people in any form,” the ministry said, adding that its troops would have no mandate to demilitarise any party.</p>

      <title>Erdogan postpones UAE visit over Al Nahyan’s health</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973803/erdogan-postpones-uae-visit-over-al-nahyans-health</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISTANBUL: Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a postponement of his visit to Abu Dhabi due to a health issue involving Emirati leader Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan but later deleted the post from social media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message, posted by Erdogan’s team on X, said he had talked with Al Nahyan by phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the course of the call, President Erdogan expressed his sadness over the health problem experienced by (President) Al Nahyan and wished him a prompt recovery,” said the three-paragraph message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/trpresidency/status/2023136958352859592'&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erdogan would travel to the United Arab Emirates at a later date, still to be determined, the message added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the message — of which &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; has a screen grab — was quickly deleted from the account, it had already been picked up by official Turkish media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkiye’s state broadcaster likewise took down its article on Erdogan that mentioned the Emirati leader’s health problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official Emirati news agency, WAM, reported on the telephone conversation between the two leaders, but did not mention that Erdogan’s visit had been postponed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contacted by &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;, neither the Turkish presidency nor the Emirati authorities — who have themselves made no statement on their president’s health — have yet answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Emirati leader’s team on Saturday evening released photos taken the same day showing Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, smiling and apparently in good health, with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>British Museum under fire after removing word ‘Palestine’ from some displays
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973804/british-museum-under-fire-after-removing-word-palestine-from-some-displays</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Historian William Dalrymple criticises move, later says museum has not ‘cancelled’ the term wholesale&lt;br&gt;• Legal challenges instituted against campaign by UK Lawyers for Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON: The British Museum has removed the word ‘Palestine’ from some of its gallery displays, revising maps and information panels in its ancient Middle East collections on the grounds that the term was used inaccurately and is no longer historically neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports in leading British papers, including The Guardian, said the changes affect displays in the museum’s ancient Levant and Egypt galleries, where parts of the eastern Mediterranean coast had previously been labelled as ‘Palestine’, and some individuals described as being of “Palestinian descent”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one panel in the Egypt galleries was amended to replace “Palestinian descent” with “Canaanite descent”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revisions followed representations from UK Lawyers for Israel (LFI), a voluntary group of solicitors, which wrote to the museum’s director arguing that the retrospective application of the term ‘Palestine’ across thousands of years obscured historical change and erased the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah from around the first millennium BCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its response, the museum said that while ‘Palestine’ had been widely used in Western and Middle Eastern scholarship since the late nineteenth century as a geographical designation, it no longer carried a neutral meaning and is now often understood as referring to a modern political territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum said it uses ‘Can­aan’ for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BCE, UN terminology for modern political boundaries, and ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision has prompted criticism from historians and members of the public, with more than 5,000 people signing a petition calling for the museum to reverse the changes and arguing that they contribute to the erasure of Palestinian presence from public memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian also noted that while several displays have been updated, the museum claims these changes were made last year after feedback and audience research. Historian and author William Dalrymple criticised the move, calling it ridiculous to remove the word ‘Palestine’, when it has a greater antiquity than the word ‘British’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first reference to Palestine is on the Egyptian monument of Medinet Habu in 1186 BCE. The first reference to Britain is the 4th century BC when it appears in the work of the Greek traveller Pytheas of Massalia,” he wrote on X. In a subsequent post, Dalry­mple said that after speaking with the museum’s director, Nich­olas Cullinan, he had lear­ned that reports about the muse­um cancelling the name ‘Palestine’ altogether were inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/DalrympleWill/status/2023399058690158797'&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting Cullinan, Dalrymple wrote: “To reassure you we are not removing mention of Pales­tine from our labels. Indeed, we have a display on at the moment about Palestine and Gaza.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the historian, the director of the British Museum had said that only two panels in the ancient Levant gallery were amended last year during a routine gallery refresh, and that the director had not been aware of the issue until it became public. Cullinan was quoted as saying he had not seen the letter from UK Lawyers for Israel until recently and was “disgusted by the whole thing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academics who spoke to Middle East Eye defended the historical validity of the term. Marchella Ward, a lecturer in classical studies at the Open University, said “ancient Palestine” was a legitimate scholarly descriptor. “I use the term ‘ancient Palestine’ frequently in my own research and will continue to do so,” she said, adding that claims the term is illegitimate are aimed at “the erasure of Palestinians”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign group Energy Embargo for Palestine accused the museum of hypocrisy, saying it claims to objectively communicate history while “preparing itself to rewrite history, to erase Palestine, and its millions of people, out of the history books”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics also argue that the museum’s decision fits into what they describe as a broader pattern of pressure exerted by UKLFI on public bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the European Legal Support Centre (ELSC), a forthcoming database documents hundreds of incidents of alleged anti-Palestinian repression in the UK between 2019 and 2025, with UKLFI appearing in a significant number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giovanni Fassina, executive director at ELSC told Middle East Eye that the targeting of the British Museum was part of a “very clear pattern” of letters threatening legal action or alleging breaches of UK law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ELSC and the Public Interest Law Centre have submitted a complaint to the Solicitors Regulation Authority over UKLFI’s alleged use of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Charity Commission has also confirmed it is investigating the group’s charitable wing following complaints by advocacy organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UKLFI had argued in its letter that describing ancient civilisations as Palestinian creates “a false impression of continuity”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trade gap with Mideast narrows in July-Dec
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973830/trade-gap-with-mideast-narrows-in-july-dec</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit with the Middle East narrowed 3.92 per cent in the first half of 2025-26, driven by a slight decline in imports and exports to the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In absolute terms, the trade deficit contracted to $7 billion in July-December FY26 from $7.285bn over the corresponding period last year, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FY25, the deficit with the region increased 7.37pc to $13.974bn from $13.014bn the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to the Middle East fell 6.06pc to $1.502bn in 6MFY26 from $1.599bn over the corresponding months of last year. In FY25, exports to the region fell 1.52pc to $3.107bn from $3.155bn in the same preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote-level-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to the region fall 6pc to $1.502bn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Pakistan’s imports from the Middle East saw a decline of 4.29pc to $8.502bn in 6MFY26 from $8.884bn over the corresponding period last year. In FY25, imports rose 5.64pc to $17.081bn from $16.169bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has recently &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1961412"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to minimise its trade imbalance with the region. The demand for Pakistani products dropped in the UAE during the period under review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Saudi Arabia fell 7.28pc to $337.927m in July-December FY26 from $364.465m over the same period last year. The imports from the kingdom saw an increase of 6.19pc to $1.919bn against $1.807bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to the UAE declined 6.06pc to $1.023bn in 6MFY26 from $1.089bn over the last year. Major export products, include rice, bovine carcasses, men’s and boys’ cotton ensembles, guavas and mangoes. Imports increased by 13.24pc to $4.327bn from $3.821bn over the corresponding months of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Bahrain stood at $25.159m in 6MFY26 against $26.757m in the corresponding period last year, a decline of 5.97pc. Imports rose 61.29pc $130.432m in 6MFY26 from $80.866m last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Qatar fell 14.28pc to $51.005m from $59.503m over the corresponding period last year. Imports also dipped 9.83pc to $1.476bn from $1.637bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export to Kuwait rose 9.71pc to $65.147m in 6MFY26 against $59.385m. However, imports surged 19.82pc to $649.206m from $809.734m.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>X recovers from ‘brief’ global outage
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973799/x-recovers-from-brief-global-outage</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PARIS: Service was fully restored to the social network X on Monday afternoon following a widespread technical &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973704/x-briefly-hit-by-international-outages-monitors"&gt;disruption&lt;/a&gt; that left users across multiple continents staring at blank feeds and unable to view new posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outage, which str­u­ck the platform owned by Elon Musk, rendered the site largely inaccessible for approximately two hours before timelines began populating and functionality returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform appeared to be operating as usual by 3:30pm GMT. The restoration came shortly after Down Detector, a website that tracks online service interruptions, recorded a sharp spike in user reports regarding the site’s performance earlier in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downdector indicated that in Pakistan, the number of users reporting issues peaked at 6:54pm with a total of 275 complaints, subsequently decreasing to 8 by 7:54pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the disruption, internet connectivity monitor Netblocks posted on the open-source social network Mastodon that X appeared to be suffering “international outages”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/netblocks/status/2023392622249668648'&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netblocks, which tracks technical issues on major platforms as well as government-imposed internet shutoffs, clarified that Monday’s breakdown was “not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access issues were verified globally, with journalists in countries including France and Thailand reporting an inability to access the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for X did not immediately resp­ond to requests for comment regarding the cause of the outage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh’s Yunus announces resignation, end of interim govt</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973711/bangladeshs-yunus-announces-resignation-end-of-interim-govt</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus stepped down on Monday in a farewell broadcast to the nation, before handing over the reins to an elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, the interim government is stepping down,” the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner said. “But let the practice of democracy, freedom of speech, and fundamental rights that has begun not be halted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus returned from self-imposed exile in August 2024, days after the iron-fisted government of Sheikh Hasina was &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245"&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; by a student-led uprising, and she &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief#:~:text=Hasina%20flees%20to%20India"&gt;fled &lt;/a&gt;by helicopter to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was the day of great liberation,” he said. “What a day of joy it was! Bangladeshis across the world shed tears of happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has led Bangladesh as its &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894"&gt;chief adviser&lt;/a&gt; since, and now hands over power after congratulating the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader Tarique Rahman on a “&lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890"&gt;landslide victory&lt;/a&gt;” in elections last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people, voters, political parties, and stakeholder institutions linked to the election have set a commendable example,” Yunus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This election has set a benchmark for future elections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country’s most powerful political dynasties, will lead the South Asian nation of 170 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="rebuilt-institutions" href="#rebuilt-institutions" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Rebuilt institutions’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi voters endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum, a key pillar of Yunus’s post-uprising transition agenda, on the same day as the elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lengthy &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1949661"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, known as the “July Charter” after the month when the uprising that toppled Hasina began, proposes term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did not start from zero — we started from a deficit,” he said. “Sweeping away the ruins, we rebuilt institutions and set the course for reforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referendum noted that approval would make the charter “binding on the parties that win” the election, obliging them to endorse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, several parties raised questions before the vote, and the reforms will still require ratification by the new parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman conceded on Saturday, saying his party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly elected lawmakers are expected to be sworn in on Tuesday, after which Tarique Rahman is set to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that political clashes during the campaign period killed five people and injured more than 600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>X briefly hit by ‘international outages’: monitors</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973704/x-briefly-hit-by-international-outages-monitors</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Service was restored to Elon Musk-owned social network X on Monday afternoon after it had failed to show posts to users in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was displaying content, allowing users to post and otherwise functioning normally again around 1530 GMT, after the Downdetector tracking website reported a spike in outage reports around two hours before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downdector showed that reports of issues peaked in Pakistan at 6:54pm, with 275 users flagging problems, before slowly tapering down to 8 by 7:54pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X had appeared to be suffering “international outages,” connectivity monitor Netblocks posted on the open-source social network Mastodon during the disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakdown was “not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, added Netblocks, which regularly flags technical issues with popular online services and sites as well as interference by national governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its most recent posts about similar outages for X came on February 9, the day after the Super Bowl in the US, and February 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; journalists in countries including France and Thailand had also been unable to access X on Monday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for X did not respond to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on the outage before service was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk laid off thousands of people at the former Twitter and changed its name after buying the service in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has since merged it with his xAI company, which develops the Grok chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xAI is set to in turn be absorbed by Musk’s rocket firm SpaceX, with that merged entity expected to go public as early as summer this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the social media platform faced issues twice, on &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1966761"&gt;Jan 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1967322"&gt;Jan 16&lt;/a&gt;, with the outages affecting thousands of users globally.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iran says US ‘more realistic’ on nuclear issue, as Guards begin drills in Hormuz Strait</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973697/iran-says-us-more-realistic-on-nuclear-issue-as-guards-begin-drills-in-hormuz-strait</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iran said on Monday that the United States’s position on Iran’s nuclear programme “has moved towards a more realistic one”, a day ahead of a second round of &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973203"&gt;US-Iranian talks in Geneva&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tehran’s foreign minister arrived in Geneva for the new round of indirect negotiations with the US, as the Revolutionary Guards began military drills in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping lane for oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides recently resumed &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1971383"&gt;indirect talks&lt;/a&gt;, mediated by Oman, after US President Donald Trump repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1969711"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran, beginning a &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/trends/israel-iran-conflict"&gt;12-day war&lt;/a&gt; that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one,” said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, the official &lt;em&gt;IRNA&lt;/em&gt; news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tehran, talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war games being conducted by the Guards, the ideological arm of the military, aim to prepare it for “potential security and military threats” in the Strait, Iranian state TV said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic waterway through which about 20 per cent of global oil passes, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday, “We’re hopeful there’s a deal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on X that he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, “for deep technical discussion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araghchi added on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973542"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country’s nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “&lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973165"&gt;best thing that could happen&lt;/a&gt;”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His remarks came before &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1968309"&gt;demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; outside Iran against its authorities swept a number of cities, including in the US, over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="viable-deal" href="#viable-deal" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Viable’ deal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iran’s deputy foreign minister told the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement,” said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran’s ability to enrich more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whereabouts of Iran’s stockpile of around 400 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to 60 per cent remains unknown, with inspectors having last seen it in June.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CDF Field Marshal Munir terms UAE’s security, stability ‘integral part of Pakistan’s own security’: ISPR</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973688/cdf-field-marshal-munir-terms-uaes-security-stability-integral-part-of-pakistans-own-security-ispr</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, in a meeting with the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi, affirmed that the security and stability of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are “an integral part of Pakistan’s own security”, the military’s media wing said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Marshal Munir made the remarks during a meeting with the Deputy Ruler of Abu Dhabi and National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during which they discussed “ways to further strengthen bilateral cooperation across various sectors, particularly in the fields of economic collaboration, investment and security,” according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two leaders also “exchanged views on regional developments and emphasised the importance of continued coordination to promote peace and stability in the region,” ISPR added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Marshal Munir, during the meeting, “expressed his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the government of the UAE for its longstanding investments and continued support to Pakistan’s economy and security over the decades”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per ISPR, the army chief “noted that such support reflects the deep-rooted historical relations between the two brotherly countries and commended the constructive role of the UAE leadership in advancing economic and social development in Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, the field marshal reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to continuing joint efforts to “further strengthen this partnership in all fields, in a manner that serves the interests of both brotherly peoples and contributes to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and UAE maintain close bilateral relations. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone call with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, lauding the Gulf country’s “consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Field Marshal Munir &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1730918"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at Qasr Al Shati Palace, where the two reviewed bilateral cooperation between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan, Austria agree to further strengthen bilateral ties</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973689/pakistan-austria-agree-to-further-strengthen-bilateral-ties</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and Austria on Monday agreed to further strengthen bilateral ties as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Chancellor Christian Stocker in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973375/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-austria-on-2-day-visit"&gt;arrived in Vienna&lt;/a&gt; a day earlier on a two-day visit, with the Foreign Office (FO) noting that it marked the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz and Stocker held a “restricted meeting” at the Federal Chancellery today, which was followed by delegation-level talks, a &lt;a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://pid.gov.pk/site/press_detail/31962"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; issued by PID said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation talks included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, and Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement read: “Both leaders recalled the friendly and historic ties between the two countries and committed to work together more closely to further strengthen the bilateral relationship in diverse fields, including economic cooperation, trade and investment, tourism, hospitality, education, IT, healthcare and human resource development and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To this end, they agreed to work for the early finalisation of MoUs (memoranda of understanding) under consideration related to these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier and the chancellor also “exchanged views on regional and global developments, and agreed on the central role of the United Nations in addressing the challenges of peace and security, peaceful settlement of disputes, sustainable development, climate action and protection and promotion of human rights”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They expressed their shared commitment to multilateralism and appreciated mutual support for each other’s candidatures, while working together with the international community for strengthening the UN system,” PID added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz thanked Stocker for the “meaningful and productive meetings” during the visit, which he said would lend fresh impetus to bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also extended an invitation to the chancellor to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at his earliest convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the PID statement, the premier and the chancellor co-chaired a meeting of chief executive officers (CEOs) from leading Austrian and Pakistani companies working in a wide range of areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was agreed to expand G2G (government to government), G2B (government to business) and B2B (business to business) engagements between the two countries through the effective utilisation of the existing platforms,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister invited the Austrian businesses and companies to participate in the upcoming EU-Pakistan Business Forum to be held in Islamabad in April this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz and Austrian Federal Economic Chamber Vice President Carmen Goby also witnessed the signing ceremony of an MoU between Pakistani and Austrian companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X later, PM Shehbaz stressed that his visit “carries special significance as we are having a high-level visit after more than three decades”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It also coincides with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan–Austria diplomatic relations,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He termed the meeting with Stocker “most warm and productive”, reiterating that the two reaffirmed their countries’ resolve to work closely in diverse fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, PM Shehbaz stated that Pakistan was working with European partners to “jointly ban” illegal immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the Pakistan–Austria High-Level Business Roundtable in Vienna, he affirmed Pakistan was “absolutely” against illegal immigration and was “working with our European friends — Austria, France, and Germany — to jointly ban this illegal immigration [and bring it] to a grinding halt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He assured Austria that Pakistan would fulfil its “demand for skilled labour” as per the international certification required by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of his address, the premier stressed that Pakistan and Austria shared “long-standing friendly relations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier outlined the areas in which the two countries remained “proactively engaged”, including mining and minerals and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He detailed that he held meetings with the leadership of Austria, stating that he aims “to take many of these discussions to their logical conclusion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that 6o per cent of Pakistan’s population was young and “needed modern training in their hands, including laptops, AI, and IT-led initiatives”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz highlighted that Pakistan held “huge potential” in the field of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here, Austria can be a great partner, providing Pakistan with experience and modern technology to have value-addition in the field of citrus root, and make marmalade, juices and export them to Austria, the Middle East and other parts of the world”, the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FM Dar delivered the opening at the roundtable, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that the forum brought together leading businesses from both countries, reflecting the positive momentum in Pakistan–Austria trade and investment ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the occasion, Dar emphasised expanding cooperation in trade, investment, technology, and innovation, while highlighting Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms and focus on improving the ease of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted the “natural complementarities between Austria’s technological strengths and Pakistan’s dynamic market and young workforce”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FO statement said that he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to a stronger partnership with Austria and expressed confidence that enhanced business-to-business linkages, institutional collaboration, and sustained political engagement would open new avenues of growth, connectivity, and long-term economic partnership with Austria and across the European region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement said that the national anthems of both countries were played at the arrival, and both leaders “introduced their respective delegations to each other before proceeding for tête-à-tête and the delegation-level talks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier also penned his remarks in the guest book at the Chancellery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This visit marks 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded xmlns="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan and Austria on Monday agreed to further strengthen bilateral ties as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met Chancellor Christian Stocker in Vienna.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1973375/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-austria-on-2-day-visit">arrived in Vienna</a> a day earlier on a two-day visit, with the Foreign Office (FO) noting that it marked the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria since 1992.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz and Stocker held a “restricted meeting” at the Federal Chancellery today, which was followed by delegation-level talks, a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://pid.gov.pk/site/press_detail/31962">press release</a> issued by PID said.</p>
<p>The delegation talks included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, and Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch.</p>
<p>The statement read: “Both leaders recalled the friendly and historic ties between the two countries and committed to work together more closely to further strengthen the bilateral relationship in diverse fields, including economic cooperation, trade and investment, tourism, hospitality, education, IT, healthcare and human resource development and mobility.</p>
<p>“To this end, they agreed to work for the early finalisation of MoUs (memoranda of understanding) under consideration related to these areas.”</p>
<p>The premier and the chancellor also “exchanged views on regional and global developments, and agreed on the central role of the United Nations in addressing the challenges of peace and security, peaceful settlement of disputes, sustainable development, climate action and protection and promotion of human rights”.</p>

<p>“They expressed their shared commitment to multilateralism and appreciated mutual support for each other’s candidatures, while working together with the international community for strengthening the UN system,” PID added.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz thanked Stocker for the “meaningful and productive meetings” during the visit, which he said would lend fresh impetus to bilateral ties.</p>
<p>He also extended an invitation to the chancellor to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at his earliest convenience.</p>

<p>According to the PID statement, the premier and the chancellor co-chaired a meeting of chief executive officers (CEOs) from leading Austrian and Pakistani companies working in a wide range of areas.</p>
<p>“It was agreed to expand G2G (government to government), G2B (government to business) and B2B (business to business) engagements between the two countries through the effective utilisation of the existing platforms,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The prime minister invited the Austrian businesses and companies to participate in the upcoming EU-Pakistan Business Forum to be held in Islamabad in April this year.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz and Austrian Federal Economic Chamber Vice President Carmen Goby also witnessed the signing ceremony of an MoU between Pakistani and Austrian companies.</p>

<p>In a post on X later, PM Shehbaz stressed that his visit “carries special significance as we are having a high-level visit after more than three decades”.</p>
<p>“It also coincides with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan–Austria diplomatic relations,” he noted.</p>
<p>He termed the meeting with Stocker “most warm and productive”, reiterating that the two reaffirmed their countries’ resolve to work closely in diverse fields.</p>

      <title>India hosts five-day AI summit as safety concerns grow</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973703/india-hosts-five-day-ai-summit-as-safety-concerns-grow</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A global artificial intelligence summit kicked off in New Delhi on Monday with big issues on the agenda, from job disruption to child safety, although some attendees warned the broad focus could make concrete commitments from world leaders less likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits for many tech companies, anxiety is growing over the risks that it poses to society and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five-day AI Impact Summit aims to declare a “shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the fourth annual gathering addressing the problems and opportunities posed by AI, after previous international meetings in Paris, Seoul and Britain’s wartime code-breaking hub Bletchley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  ' data-original-src='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UB5kRjmDa4'&gt;
        &lt;div class='media__item  media__item--youtube  '&gt;&lt;iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UB5kRjmDa4?enablejsapi=1&amp;controls=1&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0' loading='lazy' allowfullscreen='' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touted as the biggest edition yet, the Indian government is expecting tens of thousands of visitors from across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes 20 national leaders and 45 ministerial-level delegations, who will rub shoulders with tech CEOs, including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Google’s Sundar Pichai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AI Impact Summit will enrich global discourse on diverse aspects of AI, such as innovation, collaboration, responsible use and more,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is “further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology”, and “shows the capability of our country’s youth”, added Modi, who was to inaugurate the event later on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/narendramodi/status/2023238504688538002'&gt;

        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/2023238504688538002"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the busy conference site, panels and roundtables were held on topics ranging from how AI can make India’s treacherous roads safer to how South Asian women are engaging with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="three-sutras" href="#three-sutras" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Three ‘sutras’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether Modi and the likes of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will take meaningful steps to hold AI giants accountable is in doubt, said Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven' data-original-src='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969526'&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even the much-touted industry voluntary commitments made at these events have largely been narrow ‘self-regulatory’ frameworks that position AI companies to continue to grade their own homework,” she told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bletchley gathering in 2023 was called the AI Safety Summit, but the meetings’ names have changed as they have grown in size and scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891143/paris-summit-grapples-with-real-world-impact-of-ai"&gt;AI Action Summit in Paris&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of nations signed a statement calling for efforts to regulate AI tech to make it “open” and “ethical”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States did not sign, with Vice President JD Vance warning that “excessive regulation… could kill a transformative sector just as it’s taking off”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven' data-original-src='https://www.dawn.com/news/1890897'&gt;
        &lt;div class='media__item  media__item--newskitlink  '&gt;    &lt;iframe

        sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delhi summit has the loose themes of “people, progress, planet” — dubbed the three “&lt;em&gt;sutras&lt;/em&gt;”. AI safety remains a priority, including the dangers of misinformation such as deepfakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is real scope for change” although it might not happen fast enough to prevent harm to minors, said AI Asia Pacific Institute director Kelly Forbes, whose organisation is researching how Australia and other countries are requiring platforms to confront the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="ai-for-the-many" href="#ai-for-the-many" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI for ‘the many’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisers highlight this year’s AI summit as the first hosted by a developing country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The summit will shape a shared vision for AI that truly serves the many, not just the few,” India’s IT ministry has said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year India leapt to third place — overtaking South Korea and Japan — in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say the country has a long way to go before it can rival the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, AI could threaten jobs in industries from software development and factory work to filmmaking, with India’s large customer service and tech support sectors particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about Indian call centres, startup co-founder Peush Bery told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; at the summit that AI voice tools “will definitely remove that job” within a few years, but that society would evolve to cope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New jobs come up, new fields come up”, such as working with data to ensure AI tools can recognise many different accents, Bery said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded xmlns="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>A global artificial intelligence summit kicked off in New Delhi on Monday with big issues on the agenda, from job disruption to child safety, although some attendees warned the broad focus could make concrete commitments from world leaders less likely.</p>
<p>While frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits for many tech companies, anxiety is growing over the risks that it poses to society and the environment.</p>
<p>The five-day AI Impact Summit aims to declare a “shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration”.</p>
<p>It is the fourth annual gathering addressing the problems and opportunities posed by AI, after previous international meetings in Paris, Seoul and Britain’s wartime code-breaking hub Bletchley.</p>
    <figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  ' data-original-src='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UB5kRjmDa4'>

    </figure>
<p>Touted as the biggest edition yet, the Indian government is expecting tens of thousands of visitors from across the sector.</p>
<p>That includes 20 national leaders and 45 ministerial-level delegations, who will rub shoulders with tech CEOs, including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Google’s Sundar Pichai.</p>
<p>“The AI Impact Summit will enrich global discourse on diverse aspects of AI, such as innovation, collaboration, responsible use and more,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X.</p>
<p>It is “further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology”, and “shows the capability of our country’s youth”, added Modi, who was to inaugurate the event later on Monday.</p>
    <figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/narendramodi/status/2023238504688538002'>

    </blockquote>
</span></div>
        
    </figure>
<p>At the busy conference site, panels and roundtables were held on topics ranging from how AI can make India’s treacherous roads safer to how South Asian women are engaging with the technology.</p>
<h2><a id="three-sutras" href="#three-sutras" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"></a>Three ‘sutras’</h2>
<p>But whether Modi and the likes of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will take meaningful steps to hold AI giants accountable is in doubt, said Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute.</p>

<p>“Even the much-touted industry voluntary commitments made at these events have largely been narrow ‘self-regulatory’ frameworks that position AI companies to continue to grade their own homework,” she told <em>AFP</em>.</p>
<p>The Bletchley gathering in 2023 was called the AI Safety Summit, but the meetings’ names have changed as they have grown in size and scope.</p>
<p>At last year’s <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891143/paris-summit-grapples-with-real-world-impact-of-ai">AI Action Summit in Paris</a>, dozens of nations signed a statement calling for efforts to regulate AI tech to make it “open” and “ethical”.</p>
<p>The United States did not sign, with Vice President JD Vance warning that “excessive regulation… could kill a transformative sector just as it’s taking off”.</p>

      <title>Ahsan Iqbal to attend Bangladesh PM-elect Tarique Rahman’s oath-taking ceremony in Dhaka</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal is set to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister-elect Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who won a landslide &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890"&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; in last week’s elections, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election was the first since a deadly 2024 uprising &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ousted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. Rahman is a scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued today, the FO said that Iqbal will represent Pakistan at the oath-taking ceremony, which is scheduled to be held on February 17 in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class='media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet' data-original-src='https://x.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/2023286119165825305'&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FO added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was unable to attend “due to a prior overseas engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan’s participation in the ceremony reflects its support for Bangladesh’s democratic process and underscores its commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of former Bangladeshi president Ziaur Rahman and the country’s former prime minister &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 13, BNP won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the country’s general elections. The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the election results last week, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz extended their felicitations to the BNP and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh. While PM Shehbaz said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership and strengthening the two countries’ “historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accused Bondi killer Naveed Akram appears in court by video link</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973644/accused-bondi-killer-naveed-akram-appears-in-court-by-video-link</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accused Bondi Beach killer Naveed Akram appeared in an Australian court via video link Monday, in his first public hearing since the nation’s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akram and his father, Sajid, allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1961437"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; a Hanukkah celebration in December. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akram has been charged with terrorism, 15 counts of murder, dozens of counts of causing wounds to a person with intent to kill and planting explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accused wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reportedly spoke only one word — “yeah” — when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akram will next appear in court on March 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking outside the court, Akram’s lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in “very onerous conditions”, national broadcaster &lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass shooting sparked national &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1962445"&gt;soul-searching&lt;/a&gt; about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1968032"&gt;gun laws&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="tactical-training" href="#tactical-training" class="heading-permalink" aria-hidden="true" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Tactical’ training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said the suspects “meticulously planned” the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a “tactical manner”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State terrorist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made a nighttime reconnaissance trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a few weeks before the Bondi Beach attack, the pair returned to Sydney from a four-week trip to the southern Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM: The Israeli government has approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972561"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of the international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories, &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development was annou­nced by Israeli public broadcaster &lt;em&gt;KAN&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday when Israeli forces killed at least 12 Palest­inians in less than 24 hours, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal, approved by the Israel security cabinet, was submitted by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defence Minister Israel Katz. “We are continuing the settlement revolution to control all our lands,” Smotrich said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, &lt;em&gt;Wafa&lt;/em&gt; news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, the &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem Pos&lt;/em&gt;t stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palestinian group Hamas condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the group called the approval “a null and void decision issued by an illegitimate occupying power. It is an attempt to forcibly impose settlement and Judaisation on the ground, in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De facto annexation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts describe the move as a de facto annexation of the Palestinian territory, warning that it will profoundly reshape its civil and legal landscape by eliminating what the Israeli ministers cal­led longstanding “legal obstacles” to the expansion of illegal settlements there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking from Ramallah, political analyst Xavier Abu Eid told Al Jazeera that Israel is “packing annexation into some sort of a bureaucratic move”. He said the International Court of Justice in 2024 said that Israeli actions amount to annexation of the occupied West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People should understand this is not just a step towards annexation, we are experiencing annexation as we speak today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Israeli government is doing is implanting their political programme — a policy that has already been presented,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strikes amid ceasefire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In multiple strikes since dawn on Sun­day, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a US-brokered &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1947576"&gt;truce&lt;/a&gt; that entered its second phase last month, violence has &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1970414"&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt; in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil defence agency said five people were killed and several injured in the attack on a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia, five others were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Yunis, and another Palestinian was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City. Besides, Israeli gunfire killed one person in Beit Lahia in north Gaza, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the people were killed as they slept. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 601 Palestinians have been killed since the truce began, while Israel claimed at least four of its soldiers were killed in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fury mounts over ‘false’ claims against UN rapporteur
</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973539/fury-mounts-over-false-claims-against-un-rapporteur</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Media reports confirm Francesca Albanese never called Israel ‘common enemy of humanity’&lt;br&gt;• Amnesty chief brands European ministers’ refusal to retract ‘political cowardice’&lt;br&gt;• French lawyers file criminal complaint against Barrot over false statements&lt;br&gt;• Ruffalo, Bardem among over 100 celebrities rallying behind UN expert&lt;br&gt;• OIC warns fabricated claims risk undermining credibility of UN Human Rights Council&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOP European government officials who led a smear campaign against United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, have failed to apologise or withdraw their calls for her resignation, even after multiple reports confirmed the &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1972588"&gt;allegations&lt;/a&gt; were based on a fabricated quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;France 24&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; verified that Albanese did not describe Israel as the “common enemy of humanity” during a forum in Qatar earlier this month, an allegation levelled by Israeli officials and echoed by European ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcripts of the event show she was referring to a global system of finance and weaponry. Yet diplomats from France, Germany and other nations have so far declined to correct the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International has demanded that European states immediately withdraw their accusations. Its secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy had attacked Albanese on the basis of a “deliberately truncated video” that gravely misrepresented her remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media — as some have done,” Callamard said. “They must publicly apologise and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She described the refusal to issue corrections as political cowardice, pointing to the stark contrast between the speed with which governments condemned a UN expert and their reluctance to hold Israel accountable for actions Amnesty has characterised as &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1951984"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; and apartheid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation added its voice to the chorus of condemnations. In a statement, the bloc said the allegations were “based on misrepresented and fabricated claims” regarding remarks the rapporteur neither made nor endorsed. The OIC warned that distorting the statements of UN mandate holders risked undermining the integrity of the Human Rights Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albanese also responded to the diplomatic fallout directly. Addressing the controversy, she clarified that her speech in Doha had identified the “common enemy” as the system enabling violence, specifically “financial capital”, “algorithms” and “weapons”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lie was exposed. Instead of retracting it, the SYSTEM that enabled the genocide, attacks the messenger,” Alban­ese wrote on X. “France knows it stepped in something foul, but pride forbids correction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She noted that three European governments had accused her with a “virulence” they never applied to the perpetrators of violence in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly surpassed 72,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal complaint filed in Paris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal pressure is now mounting in France over the government’s refusal to correct its public statements. &lt;em&gt;Middle East Eye&lt;/em&gt; reported that Jurdi, the Association of Lawyers for the Respect of International Law, had filed a crime report with the Paris public prosecutor accusing the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, of disseminating false information by a public authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrot told the French parliament that Albanese had made “outrageous and reprehensible remarks”, claiming she had targeted Israel as a nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurdi argues that because the verified transcript proves otherwise, the minister’s statement makes up a misrepresentation that could endanger the UN expert’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for Albanese also comes from the cultural sphere. According to AFP, over 100 figures from the entertainment industry — including actors Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Javier Bardem — have signed an open letter defending her work. The letter, organised by Artists for Palestine, said the rapporteur was being targeted for her defence of Palestinian rights.&lt;/p&gt;
