As a science fiction fan and one time author, it&amp;rsquo;s obviously a subject that&amp;rsquo;s been treated thoroughly from every angle. It&amp;rsquo;s good! It&amp;rsquo;s bad! It&amp;rsquo;s going to end humanity!
But it (&amp;ldquo;actual&amp;rdquo; AI) felt incredibly far away even just a few years ago. At that point in time, I did a bit of work in Text Classification and Object Detection and the results were definitely mixed.</description></item><item><title>A Little Bit of Slope Makes Up for a Lot of Y-Intercept</title><link>https://zhubert.com/articles/a-little-bit-of-slope/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhubert.com/articles/a-little-bit-of-slope/</guid><description>Years ago, I stumbled across a lecture by John Ousterhout. (You might know him as the creator of Tcl, or just as a general computer science luminary.) It was part of his weekend thought series, and one line has stuck with me ever since — straightforward, but the kind of thing that you see echo in many applications:
A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept. By way of reminder, picture two lines on a graph.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://zhubert.com/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhubert.com/about/</guid><description>Zack Hubert Engineering leader. Founder. Novelist. Two patents. One book. Lots of code. Planning Center (current) Leading engineering teams at Planning Center. We build tools that help churches run better. Turns out that&amp;rsquo;s a surprisingly complex problem.
Published Singular (2017) Wrote a science fiction novel called Singular. Vintage computers, artificial intelligence gone rogue, the fate of humanity—you know, the usual first novel stuff.
Founded The City (2008) Built a social network for churches from scratch.</description></item><item><title>The Power of Incremental Work</title><link>https://zhubert.com/articles/the-power-of-incremental-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhubert.com/articles/the-power-of-incremental-work/</guid><description>Quite a while ago, I wrote a review of The New Turing Omnibus. A very clever book whose double entendre title reinforced the wit with which the subject matter was to be handled. In short, a very fun book that covers a lot of Computer Science topics.
What’s interesting though is how one tiny passage in the foreword changed my outlook on something important. Here it is:
Sometime during my childhood I encountered the traditional image of a bird that erodes a mountain by taking a single stone from it every year.</description></item><item><title>An Amazon Story</title><link>https://zhubert.com/articles/an-amazon-story/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhubert.com/articles/an-amazon-story/</guid><description>This last week I was sitting with friends around a campfire and told the following true story. They found it rather interesting, so I figured it was worth retelling. The truth is, my career has been a really weird one…there’s nothing linear about any of the progression through work that I’ve chosen. It has been a truly wild ride, but I’m getting ahead of myself.
Amazon. 1999. It was a totally different company than it is now, though in many ways it’s probably still Day 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
