They know many people who arrived in Miami by raft, or came for a visit and stayed, and they are now residents, even citizens. The worst part, they say, is that other Cubans entered the United States just like them, crossing the border on the same date, and have been &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-04-16/from-obama-to-trump-how-two-presidents-precipitated-the-end-of-cuban-privilege-in-the-us.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-04-16/from-obama-to-trump-how-two-presidents-precipitated-the-end-of-cuban-privilege-in-the-us.html"&gt;able to adjust their immigration status&lt;/a&gt;, while they themselves haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2026-02-17/the-future-of-many-cubans-in-the-us-depends-on-a-long-legal-saga.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At midday on Monday, 10 women lay on mattresses propped against police barricades, numb from dehydration and having gone more than 50 hours without food. They had joined the hunger strike already started by the political prisoners whose freedom they are demanding. After more than a month of vigil, tents have multiplied around Zone 7, a command post of the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) in Caracas, and the protest has been growing. It is the only prison to have been visited by any government representative. There, 10 days ago, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-04-15/jorge-rodriguez-the-cold-psychiatrist-waiting-to-succeed-nicolas-maduro.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-04-15/jorge-rodriguez-the-cold-psychiatrist-waiting-to-succeed-nicolas-maduro.html"&gt;Jorge Rodríguez&lt;/a&gt;, president of the National Assembly, held an unusual meeting with relatives of political prisoners and assured them that all would be released no later than last Friday, with the &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-12/internal-differences-are-delaying-the-amnesty-promised-by-delcy-rodriguez-in-venezuela.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-12/internal-differences-are-delaying-the-amnesty-promised-by-delcy-rodriguez-in-venezuela.html"&gt;amnesty law approved&lt;/a&gt;.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration continues its offensive against the European Union &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-16/europe-is-making-progress-in-designing-its-own-new-security-architecture.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-16/europe-is-making-progress-in-designing-its-own-new-security-architecture.html"&gt;and the European project&lt;/a&gt;. The United States is moving forward to bolster its allies in the EU: the populist and Eurosceptic governments and parties that want to undermine the European project from within and which Washington considers “patriots.” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit this Sunday and Monday to Slovakia and Hungary, where he expressed his support for the national-populist Viktor Orban of Hungary in the April elections, demonstrates that Washington is putting into practice its doctrine of supporting the most reactionary forces within the bloc. Trump is cultivating his own interests, seeking to further strengthen ties with European populists and attempting to weaken the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-17/us-strengthens-ties-with-european-populists-in-its-offensive-against-the-eu-project.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

First, the exceptional nature of the concert itself: the reunion of the five guys (or, by now, men) who played to sold out venues in the 1990s is a smash hit at a time when nostalgia seems to be the only lifeline. Second, the moment of communion, with 20,000 souls of all ages and backgrounds (though mostly female) dressed in white and silver, belting out hits from 30 years ago and recreating dance routines from their teenage years. But third, and above all, it’s the venue where they’ve chosen to do it: the Sphere in Las Vegas. When the sky opens up before you and it seems like you’re about to be abducted by a spaceship, or when a song called &lt;i&gt;Siberia&lt;/i&gt; plays and the temperature drops several degrees, you know that what you’re seeing isn’t normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2026-02-17/the-backstreet-boys-at-the-sphere-in-las-vegas-a-perfect-blend-of-nostalgia-and-colossal-futurism-that-doesnt-even-require-their-presence.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Israel holds parliamentary elections in October. With Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition polling worse than the opposition, the ultranationalist partners who dream of Greater Israel fear the end of the settlement “miracle,” as one of their ministers, Orit Strock, described it in a closed-door meeting with settlers last year. “I feel,” she said, “like someone who stops at a traffic light and suddenly the light turns green.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-17/israel-upends-the-map-of-the-west-bank-upside-with-its-annexation-frenzy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite this, security is not the main topic of debate. Nor is corruption, even though scandals, both large and small, are multiplying, to the point that they even affect ministers, the president of the nation’s largest company, and members of Congress also seeking reelection. The environment is even less of a focus, despite the fact that the country has experienced a succession of &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/climate/2025-07-17/climate-change-researchers-decry-scientific-injustice-in-colombia-and-venezuela.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/climate/2025-07-17/climate-change-researchers-decry-scientific-injustice-in-colombia-and-venezuela.html"&gt;dry periods followed by torrential rains&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, leaving more than 150,000 people affected. Instead, the discussion centers on the economy, with a debated minimum wage increase, a growing fiscal deficit, the government’s proposal to define taxes by decree, and unemployment at one of its lowest levels in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2026-02-17/economic-debate-takes-center-stage-in-colombian-election-campaign.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

He was the architect and commander of Operation Surge, the strategy that significantly increased the U.S. military presence in Iraq in 2007 to counter the growing radical insurgencies. His success earned him a promotion to chief of the Central Command, in charge of U.S. forces in the Middle East.

Driven by an unconscious impulse, he had decided to master the instrument, and he succeeded, even leading a famous band in France.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Christophe Galfard (Paris, 1976) is a prominent &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-02-17/alba-moreno-physics-popularizer-no-one-should-have-to-change-the-way-they-are-dress-or-express-themselves-to-pursue-what-they-want.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-02-17/alba-moreno-physics-popularizer-no-one-should-have-to-change-the-way-they-are-dress-or-express-themselves-to-pursue-what-they-want.html"&gt;science communicator&lt;/a&gt;. After researching black holes and the origin of the universe alongside Stephen Hawking, he is now dedicated to sharing his knowledge of the cosmos. He is the author of six books, gives lectures, and hosts a program on the French radio station Radio Inter. The author of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;The Universe in Your Hand: A Journey Through Space, Time and Beyond&lt;/i&gt; is a scientist who demands precision in both his answers and his questions. He was ultimately unable to meet with EL PAÍS in person, and the interview was conducted via video call. Accustomed to working with objects millions of light-years away, the one kilometer separating the journalist’s life in Paris from that of the most brilliant disciple &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/25/inenglish/1443171082_956639.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/25/inenglish/1443171082_956639.html"&gt;of the world’s most famous scientist&lt;/a&gt;, as the book’s blurb proclaims, was far too small. Everything is relative. And that is something that Galfard will also talk about next week during his visit to Spain: he is one of the participants in the Valladolid Culture Forum, and will be present at the Telefónica Foundation Space in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2026-02-16/christophe-galfard-physicist-i-think-there-is-more-life-in-space-than-we-think.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h5 class="bg--yellow"&gt;Transplant 1&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span class="border--yellow"&gt;Male, 62 years old, resident of Extremadura&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
After an arrhythmic storm, he was transferred to the 12 de Octubre Hospital and placed on the urgent heart‑transplant waiting list, category 0B — the second‑highest urgency level in Spain.&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/WS3BSGKLCRFW5MTGOTEE5GC5KA.png?auth=577706531fecdfd0d856b2bbd1ae722ea4a5ff0a238b9f3b54357fd622bb3954" width="283" height="289"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="intro__row"&gt;
&lt;h5 class="bg--blue"&gt;Transplant 2 &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span class="border--blue"&gt;Male, 55 years old, resident of Extremadura&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
With very advanced severe heart disease, he was placed on the elective heart‑transplant waiting list in April 2025. After an arrhythmic storm, he required hemodynamic support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and was moved to the urgent transplant waiting list, category 0A — the highest urgency level.&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/XA3I742B35HBRNVN6XBVHPGWIQ.png?auth=1077a3acbe8a2f78154cac0ce58d750a488ecaeafd15866972ea1a6418ff54de" width="989" height="843"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="intro__row"&gt;
&lt;h5 class="bg--green"&gt;Transplant 3&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span class="border--green"&gt;Male, 56 years old, resident of Castilla–La Mancha&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
He had already undergone a heart transplant at the 12 de Octubre Hospital in August 2017. After an initially good evolution during the first years, his new heart began to deteriorate progressively and did not respond to any of the therapeutic measures used. He was placed on the waiting list for a retransplant in August 2024.&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/H6HH3CIOSZHBPLITOXOIVQ4JDA.png?auth=b0485e8c6297ea8f77064abb991fb7967d3cde75b5e13d107755562b970d7235" width="1060" height="828"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="intro__row"&gt;
&lt;h5 class="bg--red"&gt;Transplant 4&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span class="border--red"&gt;Male, 48 years old, resident of the  Madrid region&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
He was admitted to the hospital after the onset of severe heart failure. Within the first hours of admission, he suffered a cardiac arrest that required advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation and circulatory support with the implantation of an ECMO device. He was placed on the urgent transplant waiting list, category 0A.&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2026-02-16/four-heart-transplants-in-three-days-a-race-against-time-at-madrids-12-de-octubre-hospital.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Format:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brenda Valverde Rubio and Guiomar del Ser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Design:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ana Fernández&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Development:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernando Anido&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Which is why he’ll bluntly tell you that “[Donald] Trump is deranged”, advocate for the return of mandatory military service and defend nuclear energy. The grandson of &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/spain/2025-11-15/from-pulling-tourist-carriages-to-peaceful-pastures-malagas-horses-start-a-new-life.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/spain/2025-11-15/from-pulling-tourist-carriages-to-peaceful-pastures-malagas-horses-start-a-new-life.html"&gt;a carriage driver&lt;/a&gt; from whom Lozano Leyva inherited a love of horses (he has 66 of them on the eight-hectare farm where he lives in Dos Hermanas, in the southern province of Seville), laughingly recalls an anecdote that aptly sums up his strategy in life. During a competition for which he was riding a horse named &lt;i&gt;Opinion&lt;/i&gt;, he was surprised when people started laughing and clapping. He soon found out the reason for the crowd’s response. The animal was well-known for balking, and was an expert in reaching the finish line dead last — if it arrived at all. But this time, the horse managed to complete the course, not coming in last for the first time in its life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2026-02-15/manuel-lozano-leyva-physicist-what-trump-wants-to-do-with-nuclear-energy-is-delusional-hes-giving-millions-to-a-bunch-of-kids.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The idea — which members of Trump’s Cabinet discussed with Farley in January — would involve Chinese automotive companies entering the market through local partners and creating joint ventures in which the majority of the capital would remain in U.S. hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2026-02-16/trump-reviews-potential-entry-of-chinese-automakers-with-us-auto-industry.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conciseness is essential in the legal world, and few know that better than an assistant who has spent two years at the firm of Jorge Morell, which advises 400 tech companies in Spain and Latin America. His name is Claude, and he is an AI chatbot created by former &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/technology/2025-11-01/the-chatgpt-effect-weve-all-started-talking-like-robots.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/technology/2025-11-01/the-chatgpt-effect-weve-all-started-talking-like-robots.html"&gt;ChatGPT developers&lt;/a&gt; under the start‑up Anthropic. “It writes precisely and with few words, while other AIs embellish sentences and create confusion,” says the 43‑year‑old lawyer from Mallorca in Spain. In five minutes, Claude can draft the infamous “terms and conditions” — those 10‑page documents that flood the internet even though no one reads them. “A person would need two hours,” Morell adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2026-02-14/claude-the-chatgpt-rival-shaking-up-ai-and-software-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

On Sunday, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2026-02-09/bad-bunny-triumphs-at-super-bowl-with-a-defense-of-america-beyond-the-united-states.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2026-02-09/bad-bunny-triumphs-at-super-bowl-with-a-defense-of-america-beyond-the-united-states.html"&gt;during Bad Bunny’s halftime show at Super Bowl LX&lt;/a&gt;, Villa’s Tacos, a taqueria in the Highland Park neighborhood northeast of Los Angeles, made a cameo appearance. On Monday, the line at the restaurant was up to an hour long. It stretched out to neighboring businesses, including a couple of barbershops (both for humans and dogs). Local news stations rolled out their trucks to see the city’s star chef, Victor Villa, who arrived at his business to applause and colorful confetti. Accompanied by his team and his parents, he thanked his new and old customers — to whom he gave &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-09-25/trumps-immigration-policy-dethrones-mexicos-modelo-especial-as-the-most-popular-beer-in-the-united-states.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-09-25/trumps-immigration-policy-dethrones-mexicos-modelo-especial-as-the-most-popular-beer-in-the-united-states.html"&gt;Modelo &lt;/a&gt;and Pacífico beers — and his family, who have believed in him over the years to make his business a success. Emotional, he embraced his co-workers in long hugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2026-02-11/from-a-street-stall-in-los-angeles-to-sharing-the-stage-with-bad-bunny-villas-tacos-at-super-bowl-lx.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

It’s the usual routine in the months leading up to Carnival; these are the rehearsals of the samba schools that will parade in the Sambadrome. Each rehearsal brings together some 3,000 members and thousands more neighbors and spontaneous spectators. It’s all free, out in the street, and with the tacit approval of the traffic officers. And it happens almost every day of the week for about three months—something unthinkable in many cities. When cars disappear for a few hours, spaces for community life flourish: families dancing, children running around, impromptu barbecues, and a sense of shared space that is invaluable in a city marked by inequality and &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-11-09/lota-de-macedo-the-brazilian-visionary-determined-to-build-a-central-park-on-the-sea-in-rio-de-janeiro.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-11-09/lota-de-macedo-the-brazilian-visionary-determined-to-build-a-central-park-on-the-sea-in-rio-de-janeiro.html"&gt;sorely lacking in pedestrian areas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2026-02-10/how-rio-de-janeiros-famous-carnival-rescued-the-human-scale-of-the-city.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/J23NJGTDOREEZPWNIRQ2SLCBYQ.jpg?auth=334f767a39e267955ace6748c4ab7b9c9fecdcda12de9b11c35c5405d8036b69" width="4000" height="2667" alt="Attendees at the Rio Carnival rehearsal, February 5."&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</content:encoded>

He explains that the nap — like the &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-02-23/the-ones-who-need-little-sleep.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-02-23/the-ones-who-need-little-sleep.html"&gt;nighttime sleep period&lt;/a&gt; — is, to some extent, biologically conditioned. Humans have a predisposition to experience a drop in alertness and vigilance around midday, between six and eight hours after waking up. In fact, the word “siesta” comes from the Latin “sexta,” which in Ancient Rome referred to the sixth hour of the day from dawn; a time reserved for rest and relaxation. “There are many markers we measure in the laboratory which indicate that this period is present, even without having eaten lunch,” he states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/lifestyle/2026-02-08/from-pajamas-and-the-chamber-pot-to-the-coffee-nap-in-search-of-the-perfect-siesta.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“Let ‘er rip”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is the epitaph on the grave of Canadian actor Leslie Nielsen. Don’t look for anything poetic or profound: it refers to farts, his trademark. He was famous for carrying a small device everywhere that, when activated, mimicked the sound of flatulence. And he kept it by his side until the very end, literally. During his funeral — a cocktail and party featuring music from &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2024-07-03/liam-neeson-the-senior-avenger.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2024-07-03/liam-neeson-the-senior-avenger.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Naked Gun&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;— his wife placed it in the coffin and triggered it whenever someone came forward to pay their respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2026-02-11/the-late-blooming-success-of-leslie-nielsen-the-great-comedian-who-never-smiled.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

His great success, and also his own decline. After nine years as head of state of France, he has gone through practically every phase. Today, after a period riddled with political crises, he is entering the final stretch of his term. Weakened internally, he has decided to focus on his role as an international leader and staunch opponent of the new U.S. imperialism, ending his adventure as he began it with his famous Sorbonne speech. That is to say, by invoking the urgent need for European sovereignty. “It is time for Europe to wake up, to emerge from its status as a geopolitical minority. If we do not decide for ourselves, we will be swept away,” he said in an interview at the Élysée Palace with EL PAÍS and a group of six international newspapers, addressing some of the points he will propose at the informal meeting of EU leaders on Thursday, focused on revitalizing the EU economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-10/emmanuel-macron-the-strategy-of-bowing-down-to-the-us-doesnt-work.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/3OCEXJO6GVFTVAZQZVHPRA3UXQ.JPG?auth=5840a2ca11beb44420ad47d633dccf4877c5b2f038191b5888157b7bfbaab9c6" width="5000" height="4000" alt="Emmanuel Macron, during the interview in the Green Room of the Élysée Palace."&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/6P42Q5QROVFGZA2TD5XCGPS3ZQ.JPG?auth=6240f6c33f2fc7203d53bcaeb8f84082d1c289d43ab3b8c68a69198742078a97" width="5000" height="4000" alt="Emmanuel Macron, in his office, on Monday afternoon, before the interview took place."&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/INBMMKUJCJBKFIS5SSU466K6WM.JPG?auth=7035bbdb18f50a66c68fc551243010f51ede9a70e37ebc92fb0bcdb9dfe523f8" width="5000" height="4000" alt="Emmanuel Macron, during the interview."&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/YLKBBDJGDZDCHIQWD5YFWLYXJY.JPG?auth=f220ee4a3fdcdfad25cfd9030fd867a7c6f4bf2a34eaf91d8d51a605c43a8025" width="5000" height="4000" alt="President Macron, this Monday at the Élysée Palace."&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</content:encoded>

They had all inherited the same pale skin tone as their parents. He, on the other hand, was dark-skinned. “I decided to ask them if they were really my parents, and they told me they had adopted me in Colombia in 1982. They sat with me and showed me a video of the orphanage,” he recalls. He had been born Luis Alberto Sánchez in Cali, a hot city 7,000 mile away. Like 4,500 other Swedes born between 1970 and 2000, his Colombian parents had abandoned him. Or at least that’s what the adoption papers said, without providing any details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-15/the-swedes-searching-for-their-colombian-mothers-40-years-after-their-adoptions-they-stole-my-identity.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Future historians may well look back on the winter of 2026 as a turning point in Donald Trump’s presidency and, quite possibly, in the American democratic experiment itself. In August 2017, less than a year into his first term, Trump made clear in Charlottesville that he was prepared to excuse violence by white supremacist groups. On January 6, 2021, he sent a MAGA mob — among them armed paramilitary organizations such as the Proud Boys — to the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of an election he had lost. And it is worth recalling that, during his campaign for a second term, Trump warned of a “bloodbath” should he fail to prevail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2026-02-09/jill-lepore-trump-thrives-on-chaos-and-crisis.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The rise in the number of elderly people committing minor offenses to secure shelter, food, and medical care in prison has transformed Japan’s penitentiaries into facilities increasingly geared towards this age group, where social reintegration takes precedence over punishment. Some experts, however, warn of the high cost of maintaining an elderly prisoner and argue that prisons converted into retirement homes highlight a problem: the existence of increasingly weakened communities that &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-06/a-look-at-japans-demographic-collapse-through-the-eyes-of-its-youth.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-06/a-look-at-japans-demographic-collapse-through-the-eyes-of-its-youth.html"&gt;fail to provide adequate support for their elders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-02-04/prisons-as-retirement-homes-for-low-income-seniors-in-japan.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a time when reality often seems like an improbable dystopia, Jacinda Ardern, 45, gives the impression of arriving from another world. A world that championed the idea that power could be wielded differently. A world where empathy wasn’t a weakness, but a strength. A world that fell in love with the governing style of the young prime minister of a small, remote country, almost invisible on the news map, the antithesis of the &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/opinion/2023-11-16/testosterone-and-its-metaphors.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/opinion/2023-11-16/testosterone-and-its-metaphors.html"&gt;hyper-masculine leadership&lt;/a&gt; that prevails today.

Even in the way she left. &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-01-19/new-zealands-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-says-she-will-step-down-by-feb-7.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-01-19/new-zealands-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-says-she-will-step-down-by-feb-7.html"&gt;She resigned in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, after serving for six years, because she no longer had “enough in the tank.” She announced her resignation with a trembling voice at a press conference that went viral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/eps/2026-02-07/jacinda-ardern-the-prime-minister-who-surprised-the-world-public-life-has-become-dehumanized.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When one thinks of The Primitives, what comes to mind are the opening chords of &lt;i&gt;Crash&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most infectious pop songs of the 1980s. In Spain, the song inserted itself into a much later generation, due to a version recorded by El Canto del Loco in 2002. “From what I can remember of it, it was good, yeah,” recalls the group’s frontwoman Tracy Tracy (real name: Tracy Louise Cattell). “A lot of bands have covered it, and you know, for someone to take something and create it in a different way, it’s always a compliment,” she adds. She comes across as friendly and grateful on our video call, to which she connects from a room whose interior design and curtains look straight out of some 1970s British film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2026-02-08/the-primitives-tracy-tracy-on-rubbing-elbows-with-morrissey-and-bjork-if-i-didnt-get-into-singing-id-probably-have-gone-into-fashion.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In &lt;i&gt;Funes the Memorious&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2024-11-30/borges-fictitious-tale-becomes-reality.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2024-11-30/borges-fictitious-tale-becomes-reality.html"&gt;Jorge Luis Borges&lt;/a&gt; tells the story of a Uruguayan gaucho who, after a riding accident, develops an extraordinary memory. Funes could learn languages and recite books from memory. Recalling a single day took him an entire day, as every detail accumulated itself in his mind in its most meticulous insignificance. The poor wretch saw this as a gift, but as his story unfolds, it reveals itself more as a curse, for remembering in such detail prevented him from distinguishing the essential from the superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2026-01-12/from-borges-to-jennifer-aniston-science-begins-to-illuminate-the-mysteries-of-memory.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The women in the cult where she’s trapped kneel beside her, mimicking her screams and sobs in unison. In doing so, they absorb her individual pain and transform it into a communal experience, a shared catharsis. In real life, the closest thing to this experience is scream clubs, a new wellness trend that brings together hundreds of people to scream together in a public space. It’s a free therapy that requires nothing more than pent-up frustration. The dynamic is simple: people gather, set an intention for the scream, breathe, scream, release, and the body resets...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-12-07/the-scream-club-as-therapy-goes-viral-there-is-a-lot-of-skepticism-but-when-people-experience-it-they-see-how-transformative-it-can-be.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/v2/MZJ5B35EHVFLHGR44OANCQFQ6E.JPG?auth=179fe2af6483931d3921d9f7704c028a0b819b8eee33a527c2b2061404d0ef26" width="5472" height="3648" alt="Dozens of people attend one of the Scream Club sessions in Chicago.

The world number one is surrounded by a crowd of about 100 people and two long rows of towering plane trees, interspersed with colorful Indian reeds. He enjoys posing in dark clothing. An elegant jacket, bell-bottom trousers, and loafers give him a very sophisticated air. He is tired, but in good spirits. The night before, he won the Australian Open for the first time to become the youngest men’s tennis player to complete the Career Grand Slam; that is, to win each of the sport’s four major tournaments — the Australian Open, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/sports/2022-06-07/rafa-nadal-you-cant-accept-being-unable-to-train-because-you-wake-up-with-a-limp-every-day.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/sports/2022-06-07/rafa-nadal-you-cant-accept-being-unable-to-train-because-you-wake-up-with-a-limp-every-day.html"&gt;Roland Garros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/sports/2023-07-16/alcaraz-defeats-djokovic-takes-wimbledon-and-installs-a-new-regime.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/sports/2023-07-16/alcaraz-defeats-djokovic-takes-wimbledon-and-installs-a-new-regime.html"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;, and the U.S. Open — at least once. His presence attracts more and more onlookers, so the conversation with EL PAÍS will finally take place on the third floor of the Crown Hotel, where he has been staying during these past three weeks of sweat, progression, and, ultimately, joy. More and more photos are being taken of him. He has seven Grand Slam titles and is a superstar, but he behaves and answers question like just a regular kid from Murcia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/sports/2026-02-02/carlos-alcaraz-im-a-sensitive-person-who-is-quite-affected-by-emotions.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

It tells the story of a professional gambler sent by the mafia to Las Vegas to take over a casino. The film is considered a work of art within the film noir genre. The operation carried out October 23 by the FBI, involving NBA players and several mafia families, could well have been lifted from this acclaimed piece of film making. In total, the FBI has arrested 37 individuals connected to the fraud ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/sports/2025-10-24/how-cosa-nostra-hit-the-nba-x-ray-machines-hidden-cameras-and-fake-glasses.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seguir leyendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
