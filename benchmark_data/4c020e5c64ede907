                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world "celebrated" National Handwriting Day a couple of days back, and I read about it in the newspaper today. I generally do not celebrate any of these "world" days. They are as meaningless as "no honking" signposts on Indian roads.</p><p>But reading about this day reminded me of my relationship with pen and paper. </p><p>I have terrible handwriting; often, even I can't read the words I scribble. But how I write narrates a lot more than just what those words read. It represents the state of my mind.</p><p>I write notes, to-dos, and thought fragments every day. But I rarely write with intention anymore. There was a time when I wrote pages of words by hand. Writing morning pages in my diary was an everyday routine for years. I still have diaries full of old thoughts in the loft. Every now and then, I pick one, open a random page and read my state of mind at that time. Relive the phase of my life.</p><p>Memories abound. Some sweet moments. Some not so. But all crude. No filter.</p><p>And I don't even need to read the words to fathom the state of my mind. The handwriting is enough. I didn't recognise this connection until my wife made a passing comment once while I was scribbling away on the page. Without looking at me, she said, "Breathe. A lot is going on in your head. Try to write cleanly, and the cloud within will clear."</p><p>To this day, I live by my wife's suggestion. If I see myself writing illegibly, I will pause and try to write more clearly.</p><p>The clearer the words on the page, <em>the clearer the thoughts in my mind</em>.</p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: On Handwriting">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My small ritual for those in-between moments while I wait has changed over the years. Those moments in the billing queue. Or as I wait for the milk to boil. Or for my daughter to show up during school pickup.</p><p>My current ritual is to refresh my email in HEY. Once I realise there's nothing in there, I refresh the NDTV website. I hate the news, and yet the futility of the task feels perfect in the moment. The anticipation that something might have changed triggers a quick hit of excitement, enough to steer me through the silence.</p><p>How did I land so badly?</p><p>I am trying to think now, and I can't even remember what filled those moments before I had my first smartphone. Music, maybe? Endlessly organising MP3s into folders. Or observing stuff around me. There were games, of course. Snake. Bounce. Small, with no context, background or "progress". </p><p>I even remember the joy of loading Orkut on the puny screen of my Nokia N73.</p><p>It all changed once I got my hands on a smartphone. Games changed. Angry Birds, Doodle Jump, and such. Social media apps killed the games. Facebook became the king. And once Twitter launched, there was no going back. </p><p>My only ritual then was to scroll through the Twitter timeline. The meaningless, timeless interactions on Twitter were a perfect respite in those fleeting, yet tiresome minutes. The timeline met all the criteria. <em>And for all.</em></p><p>My interest in social media soon dwindled, and so did my ritual. I read more. RSS feed. Read-later service. I soon realised these are not ideal for short breaks. The fitting short posts are interspersed among the meaningful long ones. The triaging needs attention, and hence, it doesn't stick.</p><p>So I've landed on something compulsive that lacks any real purpose. That provides only hollow comfort. Those small games on puny screens once offered the real thing. Now there's not even a game or an app anymore. Just the pull. Just the refresh. Just the tiny thrill of <em>maybe something changed</em>.</p><p>Hasn't the mechanical act of refreshing been the ritual all along?</p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: While I Wait">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don't know how to do email and calendar. The latter troubles me more.</p><p>Addressing the lack of "emailability" is quick and easy. I love email, but I don't use it enough. I don't email too many people unless it's necessary. I don't email friends. With Slack (at work) and WhatsApp (at home), any need for email goes away. I want to improve here, but the drive is lacking. I know why I should email more, but I can't figure out how to build the habit when there's no necessity pushing me.</p><p>With a calendar, it's trickier. Here I know both the why and how, and yet I can't master this service. I oscillate between too much and not at all. I am either marking every minute of my day on the calendar or making no entries at all.</p><p>And my inability to use the calendar effectively has a tangible impact on my life.</p><p>I can't stick to any sane calendar usage, which is one reason why <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/blog/2026/i-suck-at-routine/">I suck at routine</a>. I have tried every method productivity gurus recommend for managing calendars. But nothing has stuck till now.</p><p>And my search for a balanced way continues.</p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: Email and Calendars">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

It is overhead now that I might as well get rid of.</p><p>So I logged into Readwise, cancelled my subscription, and began my search for a read-later service.</p><p>I need a simple feature – an easy way to add articles to the queue. And a good, clean interface to read. Instapaper was, of course, at the top of the list. But I just, out of curiosity, searched for other options. Matter was recommended at a couple of places. I realised it also has a free tier, which was enough for my current simple needs. </p><p>A simple queue of articles to catch up later on in a clean reading interface.</p><p>I am not interested in any of the bells and whistles. RSS feeds, notes/highlights, podcasts, or text to audio. The clean reading interface was enough for me to create an account on Matter and get going.</p><p>Plus, the long list of articles that have been pending for years is finally left behind.</p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: Unsubscribe Spree Continues">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have been pretty bored with what I am reading. Online or otherwise. My RSS feed is full of the same voices writing about similar topics. Nothing inspiring. Nothing thought-provoking. No one else is to blame. Of course. </p><p>It's not them. It's me.</p><p>My current mindset is such that what once inspired me no longer does. Posts about writing setup, meta posts about blogging, or thoughtful reflections on one's life experience would have my ears perk up. I skim through them now. I have read about them all. How many setups can I be excited about if I know I can't have it?</p><p>My biggest gripe has been losing patience with most long posts that I come across. They ramble on, the key point getting lost in flowery prose. The words are carefully chosen, pricey. <em>Bejeweled</em>. But they seem to be losing their soul.</p><p>And because nothing that I read inspires me, I have lost interest in writing. Only if I read well do I write well. Or write at all for that matter.</p><p>Time to correct that. I have unsubscribed from all the RSS feeds. I will start small, with voices that spark something in me.</p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: Losing Patience with Reading">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every December, I review my list of apps and subscriptions. I didn't break the ritual this year either.</p><p>I have moved back to <strong><mark>HEY</mark></strong> email <a href="https://social.lol/@amit/113649925489263811?ref=amitgawande.com">after a year</a>. Fastmail served me well, and I have no problems with the service. It is a near-perfect email service, to be fair. But it does make email boring, so I'm okay with paying the premium. What about the terrible search of HEY that I complained about the last time? Is it any better now? Well, time to find out. Hope it has improved enough not to be a deal breaker.</p><p>The best decision I made when I moved to HEY the first time was to switch all my email to my domain. So email hopping is comparatively painless now. I, however, made the mistake of using the masked email addresses on the Fastmail domain. So there were a few accounts that needed to be moved to an email address on my domain. I guess the fact that I had to do that tells me I didn't use the masked email feature right.</p><p>I haven't deleted my Fastmail account yet, though I have cancelled the subscription.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.amitgawande.com/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-at-9.45.18---PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1446" height="306" srcset="https://www.amitgawande.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-at-9.45.18---PM.png 600w, https://www.amitgawande.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-at-9.45.18---PM.png 1000w, https://www.amitgawande.com/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-at-9.45.18---PM.png 1446w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Not changing my mind so soon</span></figcaption></figure><hr><p>I have stopped (didn't renew) the subscription for Ivory. I am back to <mark>Mona</mark> after a year. The polish of Ivory isn't prominent enough to justify the premium it asks for. Plus, it requires an annual subscription if I am to use it across devices (iOS and Mac). Mona does the job for me.</p><p>Since the last few months, I have started listening to podcasts again. I tried Overcast for a while, but it just doesn't work for me. Plus, its Apple Watch support is pathetic. So back on <mark>Pocket Casts</mark>. (I had unsubscribed to all the podcasts I was listening to earlier and restarted my subscription list. I intentionally avoid tech podcasts where two or three guys chat about topics. I don't want to listen in on "friends" chatting.)</p><p>There was a time when I followed my RSS feeds in Readwise Reader. But the workflow just doesn't fit well – the native reading experience matters to me, and Reader does not support that. So, I have moved all my feeds to <mark>Unread</mark> Cloud. The app's reading experience is perfect.</p><p>After years of managing my todos on TickTick, I have moved to <mark>Todoist</mark>, given its better cross-platform support. Plus, it has better integration with the iPhone.</p><hr><p>I have updated the <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/defaults/">App Defaults page</a> to reflect these changes.</p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: Updates on App Defaults">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

I have had a version of this theme running on my blog for some time, <a href="https://mb.amitgawande.com/2023/04/21/a-blog-no-more/?ref=amitgawande.com">first created</a> for Hugo on Micro.blog. When I moved to Kirby, I ported my theme to make the switch seamless. I wanted to attempt the same with Ghost, too. The only thing holding me back was my lack of clarity on moving each aspect of the carefully crafted theme. <em>Could I recreate it exactly?</em></p><p>This question led to an unexpectedly enjoyable coding session with Claude, where we embarked on a complete theme migration that turned into something like pair programming with an AI.</p><h2 id="starting-with-how-hard-could-it-be">Starting with "How Hard Could It Be?"</h2><p>When I first asked about porting my Kirby theme to Ghost, I expected a straightforward template conversion. Kirby uses PHP, Ghost uses Handlebars—how different could they be? Well, it turns out quite different.</p><p>My theme wasn't just a simple blog template. Over the years, it had evolved into something quite specific: a homepage with curated "Start Here" posts, support for both long-form blog posts and microblog "notes," IndieWeb microformats throughout, and a custom newsletter integration for my Square 101 series. Oh, and a navigation system where previous/next buttons appeared on every page but only worked on post pages.</p><p>The first challenge came immediately. <em>Ghost doesn't have Kirby's flexible content structure</em>, so we needed to think creatively about how to maintain the distinction between blog posts and notes while working within Ghost's framework.</p><h2 id="the-dance-of-debugging">The Dance of Debugging</h2><p>What followed was a delightful back-and-forth debugging session. Claude would examine my Kirby templates, suggest Ghost equivalents, and inevitably, something would break. "Missing helper: feature_image" became a running theme as we discovered that Ghost's template system had its own opinions about how things should work.</p><p>Each error led to a deeper understanding. When the homepage lost its intro content, we realised Ghost's context system works differently from Kirby's page structure. When dates showed up as "July 0" instead of proper dates, we dove into Ghost's date formatting. When the navigation buttons disappeared entirely, we learned about Ghost's template inheritance.</p><p>There's something satisfying about this kind of methodical problem-solving. Each fix revealed another layer of how Ghost thinks about content, <em>and gradually, the theme began to take shape.</em></p><h2 id="the-moments-of-discovery">The Moments of Discovery</h2><p>The best part of the session was those small victories. When we finally got the two-column layout working perfectly, matching the original pixel for pixel. When the microformats are appropriately validated, preserving the IndieWeb compatibility I'd worked hard to maintain. When the newsletter integration callouts appeared exactly where they should.</p><p>One particularly satisfying moment came when we implemented the navigation system. In Kirby, I had previous/next buttons that appeared on every page but were only functional on post pages. In Ghost, this required understanding the difference between global and post-specific contexts. The solution—checking for post context and showing active or inactive states accordingly—felt elegant once we figured it out. Though this is not a solved problem yet, <em>I got the necessary understanding of why it breaks,</em></p><h2 id="the-art-of-preservation">The Art of Preservation</h2><p>Throughout the process, the goal wasn't just to make something that worked, but to preserve the exact character of the original. This meant paying attention to details that might seem trivial: the precise spacing between elements, the way tags are displayed, the subtle colour variations in different modes.</p><p>Claude was remarkably good at this kind of detail work. When I mentioned that the post structure looked different, it immediately went back to the original Kirby templates to understand what was missing. When I pointed out that dates were wrong, it didn't just fix the format—it examined the original to match it exactly.</p><h2 id="what-emerged">What Emerged</h2><p>After several hours of this iterative refinement, we had something remarkable: a Ghost theme that was virtually indistinguishable from the original Kirby site. Every visual element, every interaction, every piece of functionality had been preserved.</p><p>But more than that, the Ghost version was actually better in some ways. Featured images now work seamlessly with Open Graph tags. The template organisation is cleaner with reusable partials. Ghost's built-in SEO handling is more robust than what I had cobbled together in Kirby.</p><h2 id="the-unexpected-joy-of-ai-pair-programming">The Unexpected Joy of AI Pair Programming </h2><p>What struck me most about this experience was how much it felt like collaborating with a thoughtful colleague. Claude understood not just the technical requirements but the aesthetic goals. It caught details I might have missed and suggested improvements I hadn't considered.</p><p>There's something uniquely satisfying about this kind of work—<em>the methodical process of understanding how something works, translating it to a new system, and refining until it's exactly right. </em>Having an AI partner who could instantly examine templates, spot patterns, and suggest solutions made the whole process feel more like exploration than tedious porting.</p><p>The migration proved that <strong>switching platforms doesn't require sacrificing your site's character.</strong> With patience and attention to detail, you can maintain exactly what makes your site unique while gaining the benefits of modern tools. Sometimes the best way to appreciate what you've built is to rebuild it entirely.</p><hr><p><em>The complete Ghost theme emerged from this session, ready to deploy. It maintains every aspect of the original while embracing Ghost's modern publishing platform—proof that good design transcends the tools used to create it.</em></p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: Porting Theme with Vibe Coding">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t like blogging platforms that force me to write a title first — something that my current platform of choice, Ghost, does. It is funny how I still stick with this platform. The reason currently is its ability&nbsp;to publish and host <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/squareone/">my newsletter</a> — the dream of one platform for everything is alluring after all. Another aspect is the sheer polish of how the site looks.</p><p>But the polish is what kills my drive to write, to be frank. Every time I open the portal to publish my clumsy thoughts, I think the site does not deserve them. They are too ugly.&nbsp;<em>Just like these</em>. And it is not as if I haven’t gone down that rabbit hole earlier. I have tried Ghost multiple times over the years. <em>I use it. I have these thoughts. I stop using it.</em> This cycle has run itself many times now. Yet I keep burning myself up, signing up for the polish every time.</p><p>Why do I do that?</p><p>Of course, my eternal quest for change is one reason. And another is my dissatisfaction with my current online platform, whatever that platform is. I am never satisfied. Plus<em>,</em> I am tired of these meta posts. But they never end. And I am back again for the umpteenth time.</p><p>Everything has something that I like.&nbsp;<em><mark>Nothing has everything that I like.</mark>&nbsp;</em>So the fight within continues.</p><br><br><a href="mailto:reply@amitgawande.com?subject=RE: Too Polished?">Reply to this post</a>]]></content:encoded>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wondered how your phone instantly knows your location, even if you’ve never been there before? Whether you’re booking a cab, finding a restaurant, or tracking a morning run, there’s an invisible network in the sky quietly making it possible — the Global Positioning System, or GPS.</p><p>GPS has become so ubiquitous that we rarely pause to consider the remarkable technology behind it. It's a satellite-based navigation system operated by the United States that determines your precise location anywhere on Earth. The system consists of a constellation of satellites orbiting about 20,000 km above us, constantly broadcasting signals containing their location and the exact time the signal was sent. </p><h2 id="how-does-gps-work">How Does GPS Work? </h2><p>Your phone (or any GPS-enabled device) has a receiver that listens for these signals. By calculating how long the signals took to reach it, the receiver can work out the distance to each satellite. With distance data from at least four satellites, it can determine your exact position on Earth — a process called <strong>trilateration</strong>. </p><p>To visualise this, imagine you’re somewhere and know you’re 5 miles from school. This means you could be anywhere on a circle with the school at its centre. Now, say you know you’re 10 miles from the library. This narrows your location to the two points where the circles intersect. With a third data point—say, you’re 3 miles from a friend’s house—you can pinpoint your exact location at the single point where all three circles intersect. GPS trilateration works similarly, <em>but in three-dimensional space with satellites instead of landmarks. </em></p><p>One of GPS's most valuable features is its <strong>complete independence from internet connectivity</strong>. GPS satellites continuously broadcast their signals, and your device simply receives them—it doesn't send anything back. This one-way communication means GPS works perfectly in remote wilderness areas, during natural disasters when cell towers fail, or anywhere internet access is unavailable. The maps on your phone might require an internet connection to download, but the core positioning functionality operates entirely offline. </p><h2 id="the-satellite-constellation">The Satellite Constellation. </h2><p>A fully operational GPS network requires <em>at least 24 satellites</em> for global coverage, but there are currently about 31 active GPS satellites in orbit. They are arranged in six orbital planes to ensure that anywhere on Earth, at any given time, <em>a receiver can “see” at least four satellites. </em></p><p>While three satellites can theoretically determine your position, a fourth is essential for accuracy. Your GPS receiver's internal clock isn't as precise as the atomic clocks on satellites, so the fourth satellite helps eliminate timing errors and provides the exact time synchronisation needed for accurate positioning.</p><h2 id="gps-vs-gnss-a-global-perspective">GPS vs. GNSS: A Global Perspective. </h2><p>GPS is just one member of a larger family called Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). While GPS is the American system, other nations operate their constellations, such as Russia's GLONASS, Europe's Galileo, and China's BeiDou. Most modern devices can access multiple GNSS systems simultaneously, improving accuracy and reliability. </p><p>Signals from these systems are transmitted on agreed-upon frequency bands and use compatible formats so that a single receiver can decode multiple systems. The International Committee on GNSS (ICG), under the UN, facilitates this cooperation.</p><hr><p>From guiding ships across oceans to enabling delivery apps to find your doorstep, GPS and other GNSS systems form an invisible but essential layer of our modern world. </p><h2 id="readers-corner">Reader's Corner: </h2><p>A curated set of additional references from previous issues, shared by the community.</p><ul><li>"<a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/upc?ref=amitgawande.com">The UPC</a> - A bit of history of <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/blog/2025/barcodes/">barcodes</a>" by <a href="https://mdalves.com.br/?ref=amitgawande.com"><a href="https://mdalves.com.br/?ref=amitgawande.com">Marcos D.
