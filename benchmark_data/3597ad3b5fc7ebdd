Last time, I made an ESP32 pretend to be a webcam.

This time, it actually is one.

In this video, I take an ESP32-S3 with native USB support and turn it into a real USB UVC webcam — first using a standard camera module, and then something a bit more unusual: a 32×24 pixel infrared (thermal) camera.

Even though the thermal image is tiny, we scale it up, process it, JPEG-encode it, and stream it over USB just like a normal webcam. Surprisingly, it works really well.

Along the way, we cover:

Why ESP32-S3 is required for USB UVC

Why MJPEG makes this much simpler than you’d expect

Turning a 32×24 thermal image into a usable video stream

Nearest-neighbour vs bilinear scaling

A very real hardware bug that looked like a software problem

Practical I2C debugging advice I should follow more often

If you’re interested in USB devices, ESP32-S3 projects, thermal cameras, or just watching me lose time debugging the wrong thing — this one’s for you.

   <media:description>Thanks to https://www.PCBWay.com/?from=atomic for the fantastic PCBs and SMT assembly.

We recently repaired a broken AmazonBasics microSD adapter, and a few people in the comments pointed out that these are “built to a price” and probably not the highest quality.

That got me curious.

So in this video, I crack open a cheap AmazonBasics microSD adapter and compare it directly with a branded SanDisk adapter to see what’s actually different on the inside.

Under the microscope, the two designs turn out to be surprisingly different — from how the contacts are made, to how the SD card actually presses against them.

Is the branded one really better?
Or is the cheaper one good enough?

There’s no benchmarking or speed testing here — this is purely a mechanical and construction teardown, looking at:

Contact design and robustness

How the SD card mates with the pins

Potential failure points

Whether “built to a price” really shows up inside

Let me know what you think in the comments — which design would you trust more?

This ESP32-S3 isn’t connected to a camera at all — but your computer thinks it’s a webcam.

In this video, I’m using the ESP32-S3’s native USB support and Espressif’s USB UVC device stack to make it appear as a standard USB webcam. Instead of streaming video from a sensor, it streams generated frames - starting with a static test card, then animated GIFs, and finally a real-time game of Pong.

Along the way, we look at how MJPEG actually works, how long it takes to encode JPEG frames on the ESP32, and what kind of frame-rate budget that leaves you for doing something interesting in real time.

By the end, the ESP32 is generating live video, encoding it on the fly, and sending it over USB like any other webcam - without ever connecting a camera module.

Chapters

00:00 Pong as a webcam?!
00:15 ESP32-S3 as a USB UVC device
01:18 Static test card (the boring but important bit)
02:03 Animated GIFs and MJPEG
03:14 Frame timing and performance budget
03:40 Pong running in real time

   <media:description>This is a very silly video.

I’ve got a drawer full of microSD card adapters, and when one of them stopped working the sensible thing would have been to throw it away.

Instead, I cracked it open, poked around under a microscope, broke it even more… and then somehow managed to bodge it back into a working state.

There’s no real lesson here, no recommendation to try this yourself, and absolutely no reason to trust this adapter ever again — but it was fun to see how these things actually work on the inside.

   <media:description>Sometimes the bug isn’t in the code…

I spent way too long debugging what I thought was a software issue on this IR thermal sensor (I²C scans, pull-ups, library swaps… the usual).
Turns out the problem was much more obvious once I put it under the microscope 👀

If you’re using one of these &quot;cheap&quot; (it's still expensive!) IR modules and it “doesn’t work”, it’s worth checking the soldering on the underside before going too deep down the software rabbit hole.

A proper project video using this module is coming soon 👍

If you want one of the modules you can get them here: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4DA1cRh

But shop around for the best price/quality!

   <media:title>Drones and Lasers?</media:title>

   <media:description>Thanks to https://www.PCBWay.com/?from=atomic for the fantastic PCBs and SMT assembly.

It’s been a while since I did an unbagging video… and apparently I’ve been ordering a lot of stuff from AliExpress.

Drones, lasers, tiny ESP32 boards, weird sensors, a smart mug (??) - the problem is, I genuinely can’t remember what I ordered. So let’s open the bag and find out what’s inside.

A lot of this is random tech I picked up for future projects — some of it surprisingly useful, some of it… questionable. As usual, I’ll power things up, poke at them with a multimeter, and see what might actually turn into a proper project.

In this video:
- A tiny (and suspiciously cheap) drone: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4VUEiE3
- A laser module and detector: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3tVgh4F
- ESP32-C3 OLED modules: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3VaxVvl
- USB-C PD trigger boards: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c35Xr0J9
- Microphones compatible with the INMP441: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3PgDWKL
- Temperature &amp; humidity displays: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3B0Q06x
- A “smart” thermos flask I don’t remember ordering: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3aAUOVZ
- Night Lights: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3v1mWq7
- MAX30102 Heart rate Sensor Module: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4KjTlkT

And various other AliExpress surprises.

Several of these are definitely getting their own follow-up videos — especially the ESP32 boards, the microphones, and the laser setup — so if any of that sounds interesting, keep an eye out.

Slightly belated Christmas video - but I had to wait for the tree to come down before I was allowed to take apart the decorations!

Pretty straightforward fun - make it rechargeable - and turn the volume down! This thing is so damned loud!

If you want your own train set, you can pick one up here: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4BuZuJL

The battery charger/boost board is this one: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c400zH8J

I’ve been assembling another batch of ESP32 Rainbow boards — and three of them failed QA in different and interesting ways.

Let's take a look and see if we can salvage them - or if the boards are only good for spares...

🔕 One board with no sound
⌨️ One with a dodgy keyboard
🔌 And one where the ESP32 USB wouldn’t enumerate at all

With a bit of work under the microscope, and some buzzing out of traces, we can work out what's gone wonky and try and fix it.

   <media:description>I think we might need to do a bit of surgery on this to turn the volume down...

Many ESP32s now have built in USB support - this comes with a fantastic benefit - support for debugging from within your favourite IDE!
