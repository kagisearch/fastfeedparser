<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p>I only speak English, and I have always been a little envious of relatives who can read Chinese. My inability to read the language leaves me out of a lot of family history and culture.</p></p>

<p><p>For example, we have ancestral genealogy documents that I cannot read at all. My relatives tell me not to worry, nobody can really read them. They're written in classical Chinese, a terse literary style that's quite different from the modern language. Scholars and genealogy specialists can work through them, but for most modern Chinese speakers, even literate ones, it's genuinely difficult. Still, I know my relatives can <em>sort of</em> get it. They can make out some of it. To me, it's completely opaque.</p></p>

<p><p>I know I could OCR and translate a document. But somehow that's not the same as really looking through the original calligraphy and wording, appreciating the old documents as they were written.</p></p>

<p><p>So today I took one page from the family genealogy and asked Claude Code to help me create <a href="https://davidbau.github.io/bau-geneaology/">this interactive reader</a>.</p></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lessons from Financial Survival Under Authoritarian Regimes</em></p>

<p><h4>The Hamburg Banker's Dilemma</h4></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1933, Max Warburg sat in his mahogany-paneled office at M.M. Warburg & Co., the bank his family had operated in Hamburg since 1798. Outside, Nazi brownshirts marched through the streets, but inside the bank, Warburg clung to a belief that would ultimately cost him dearly: <em>This too shall pass.</em></p>

<p>Five years later, in August 1938, he would finally flee Germany after the forced sale of his family's bank to "Aryan" associates. His American cousins, who had begun moving assets abroad when Hitler first rose to power, preserved much of their wealth. The difference between partial and total loss? The courage to act on early warnings rather than wait for certainty.</p>

<p>This pattern—the gradual tightening of financial controls, the windows of opportunity that slowly close, the devastating cost of optimism—repeats across history with remarkable consistency....<br />

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1932, Stalin's authoritarian central planning program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">wrecked Soviet agriculture, starving millions</a>. As the crisis deepened, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko">Trofim Lysenko</a>, a mediocre agronomist backed by Stalin, rejected established genetics as "bourgeois pseudoscience" and reorganized Soviet agriculture around his ideological theories. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism">Plants could be trained by their environment</a>, he claimed. Wheat could learn to resist cold through exposure. Scientific evidence was capitalist propaganda.</p>

<p>When the predictable disasters struck, Lysenko did not admit error. Instead, he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_research_in_the_Soviet_Union#Biology">blamed the scientists he had silenced</a>. The geneticists he had purged were "wreckers" and "saboteurs" whose treachery explained why his methods failed. Thousands of real scientists were imprisoned or executed while millions of Soviet citizens starved.</p>
