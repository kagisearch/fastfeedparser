										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I&#8217;m traveling for both business and pleasure and attending my first <a href="https://www.quiltcon.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuiltCon</a> in Raleigh, NC. Pretty much every fandom and hobby has some kind of convention you can attend. QuiltCon is the largest modern quilt show in the world, hosted by the Modern Quilt Guild. Just like with pen shows, there is a vendor market, a slew of classes one can take, lots of social events and meetups. The only real difference is that there is a also a juried quilt show, meaning you have to be accepted to display a quilt, and it&#8217;s a competition for prizes! Oh, and it&#8217;s HUGE.</p>
<p>So what does one take to a quilt show? In addition to the standard water bottle, snacks, comfy shoes and a tote bag for purchases, this is what I&#8217;m carrying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quilting Clips &#8211; use these suckers to hold fabric together in place of pins (I packed those too, but I don&#8217;t want to drop them anywhere.)</li>
<li>A handy ruler &#8211; this one happens to be 2.5&#8243; x 8&#8243;!</li>
<li>A rotary cutter &#8211; OLFA happens to be my favorite brand and you know I&#8217;m digging the purple. Technically this will need to go in my checked suitcase to get to QuiltCon, but then it will accompany me each day since I will be taking classes!</li>
<li>An adorable draw string tote to hold it all. This one was a gift from Ana and came filled with tea. Now it holds all my EDC essentials!</li>
<li>A notebook &#8211; how could I not? This is the <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2023/06/a-new-stationery-store-may-day-paper-post/">Denik Notebook I purchased from our local stationery shop</a>. It went with me on my last business trip, so it is now my quilty travel notebook.</li>
<li>Pens &#8211; here I chose two. I&#8217;m still in love with my <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2026/01/rediscovering-gel-pens-the-pilot-g2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pilot G2 purple gel pens</a>, and there&#8217;s no inky hassle with those on planes so it made lots of sense. Also I couldn&#8217;t possibly leave my <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2025/11/whats-new-pussycat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retro 51 Patchwork + matching Rickshaw sleeve</a> at home for the big con right?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back next week with a full report and (I hope) a pretty journal spread to share!</p>

<p>Since the arrival of Troublemaker and some of its signature colors like Abalone, other ink makers have ventured into the multi-chrome world but, in browsing my collection, Abalone still stands out as a unique and singular ink. <a href="https://vanness1938.com/products/vinta-inks-collection-deep-water-blue-lucia-1952?_pos=5&amp;_psq=vinta+deep&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinta&#8217;s Lucia Deepwater</a> is more navy blue with the pink and green undertones while <a href="https://vanness1938.com/products/van-diemans-professional-natura-dualis-nightfall-dual-tone-fountain-pen-ink?_pos=1&amp;_sid=e1efc93cd&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Van Dieman&#8217;s Nightfall</a> is a lighter purly-pink. The closest Sailor ink I had on hand was <a href="https://www.dromgooles.com/products/sailor-yurameku-kyokkou-20ml-bottled-ink?_pos=1&amp;_psq=Kyokkou&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyokkou</a> and its much more reddish &#8212; at least in my swatch.</p>
<p>The swatch on Dromgoole&#8217;s site is totally different! Is it my camera or the paper? Either way, Kyokkou is not a dupe for Abalone, no matter what color appears for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve recently acquired several packs of paper for 6-ring binders like <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2024/04/i-joined-the-plotter-posse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plotter</a>, <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2015/01/inside-my-filofax-original-planner-personal-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filofax</a> and similar. While you can cut and punch paper yourself to fill 6-ring binders, its fun to see that the 6-ring binder market is being revitalized.</p>
<p>I bought a combination of Personal/Bible size (6.73&#215;3.74&#8243;) and A5 size (8.26&#215;5.82&#8243;). Many of these are also available in the Pocket size but I don&#8217;t currently have a binder in Pocket size (4.72&#215;3.18&#8243;).</p>
<p>I purchased:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Raymay-Decona-Refill-A5-Tomoe-River-Paper-4-mm-Dot-Grid/pd/33604">Raymay Decona Refill A5 Tomoe River Paper (4 mm Dot Grid) </a>($4.50 for 20 sheets)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Raymay-Decona-Refill-A5-Tant-Paper-6.5-mm-Rule/pd/33601">Raymay Decona Refill A5 Tant Paper (6.5 mm Rule)</a> ($5.30 for 20 sheets)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Raymay-Davinci-Refill-Bible-Personal-Size-6.5-mm-Ruled-100-Sheets/pd/11680">Raymay Davinci Refill Bible/Personal Size 6.5 mm Ruled </a>($6.50 for 100 sheets)</li>
<li><a href="https://vanness1938.com/products/sakae-tp-iroful-personal-organizer-bible-size-refill-blank?_pos=24&amp;_sid=8dd4c2a7d&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iroful Personal Organizer Bible Size Refill Blank ($8 for 50 sheets)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I randomly chose different paper sizes, paper types and rulings without doing a ton of research. It was only when I started testing the paper that I discovered some of the paper was Tomoe River (RayMay Decona 4mm Dot Grid and probably the RayMay DaVinci 6.5mm Ruled but it says its 52gsm bu doesn&#8217;t call out Tomoe River specifically). The pink colored paper is a type of paper called Tant and has a very unique texture made from cotton and flax that is normally used for origami but works great with fountain pens.</p>
<p>Once I tested the papers, I discovered some interesting things. The Iroful paper, which I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2025/07/paper-review-iroful-a5-notebook-75gsm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed before</a> (and <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2024/01/paper-review-sakae-tp-iroful-loose-leaf-a5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina</a> and <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2024/04/notebook-review-sakae-tp-iroful-notebook-a5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura did too</a>), didn&#8217;t need a thorough review but, when I have a particular use for paper, then I realize what characteristics I need. The Iroful spreads fountain pen ink a little bit which on larger sheets isn&#8217;t a big deal but on the reduced real estate of a Bible/Personal-sized sheet can be a problem. The small scale of Bible/Personal planners means every bit of space is precious.</p>

<p>Both the Decona Dot Grid A5 and DaVinci Personal Lined paper is Sanzen Tomoe River &#8212; or as close to it as I could tell. Surprisingly, the DaVinci paper (listed as 52gsm but not specifically Tomoe River) has a similar issue with ink spread  as the Iroful but the Decona did not. As a result, both raise the question of the overall quality of the Tomoe River paper from these batches. I loved the Decona and then realized it was Tomoe River so I was very &#8220;duh! of course!&#8221; and the back of the paper showed very little show through.</p>
<p>The DaVinci was a little squidgy and had more showthrough so maybe its not Tomoe River. For rollerball, gel, ballpoint or felt tip, the DaVinci paper works great and the thinness of the paper will maximize how many sheets you can carry at any one time.</p>

<p>The surprise was the Decona Tant pink paper. It has a very unusual texture. It&#8217;s pleasingly toothy (to me) but others might not like it. There is no bleed through and almost no show through even with a thick marker. The color was pleasing and if pink is not your thing, there is an option for ivory as well.</p>

<p>I enjoy having a collection of paper to use in my 6-ring binders and will find ways to use each type of paper to make it quick and easy to add paper when and how I need it. But it does make me think that I need to play with random paper and the hole punch I have so I can add whatever, whenever to my binders.</p>

<p>These pens are soft hex shaped barrels with a snap cap. The cap can be posted but make the pen ridiculously long. The nibs are unusual and custom Caran D&#8217;Ache nibs. They are an unusual shape with the hexagon &#8220;logo&#8221; embossed on the nib and a slit but no breather hole. Sleek looking.</p>

<p>Both models I have (or had) are EF nibs that I love though I have had to have one or the other tuned. But as a result, I love the nibs. I use them with cartridges since they are long enough to hold two cartridges, one in use and one in the barrel for a quick replacement. This makes them great for an office environment: snap cap and two cartridges for quick ink swap. These conveniences are what made me fall in love with them in the first place. The day-glo color makes the pens easy to spot in a bag, case or on your desk but there are navy, black and white options if you want one that&#8217;s not so flashy.</p>
<p>I did have a fuss at one point and <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2023/05/i-modded-my-849s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swapped out the nibs</a> with some cheap Delike and PenBBS nibs but I switched the nib back and it works fine. (Insert eye roll at me here).</p>

<p>The nibs have an interesting stub-ish quality to the writing that I love with all my heart. I hope I find the pink one again. It was my original Caran d&#8217;Ache and I have a little sentimentality about it.</p>

<p>Sadly, Caran d&#8217;Ache has not added new colors or patterns on the barrels since the original release of these pens. They release a bunch of 849 ballpoints every year with custom colors, wraps and special designs but the fountain pens have been neglected. They did release an <a href="https://goldspot.com/collections/carandache-849-collection?pf_pt_product_type=Fountain+Pen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-black version complete with a black nib</a> but the price for this model is almost twice what I originally paid for the 849 fountain pens but is has been NINE YEARS!</p>
<p>My advice to you is to dig into your collection and refill a pen you loved at one point but haven&#8217;t used lately. Give it another try. Maybe its as good as it ever was or maybe its not for you anymore? Either way, you will be able to determine if its a pen forever or a pen whose time has come to move on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got a ton of freelance work this month. Which is great because January is a slow month for the shop so I was a little short on funds. However, when it rains, it pours, right? So, all the freelance I need to get out of my financial hole means I am working A LOT. Then I am out of town for the California Pen Show in the middle of the month. So, hi. Welcome to Link Love. I am too busy to say much more this week. Check in with me next week. I will either be deliriously tired or contentedly counting my newfound wealth.</p>

<p>Of all of these, I have to say that I still prefer the Pilot Juice (and <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2026/01/rediscovering-gel-pens-the-pilot-g2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the G2 of a few weeks ago</a>) as my favorite. That may be because I&#8217;m leaning towards wider nibs that put down more ink these days, but I just find them so &#8220;flowy&#8221; to write with. They just glide across the page and are such a pleasure to use. I think the Pentel EnerGel pens were a close second there. In comparison, my original <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2017/06/from-the-archives-papermate-inkjoy-0-7mm-14-color-set/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PaperMake Ink Joy Gels</a> feel a little clunky now.</p>

<p>I do appreciate the finer points for those who wish to use them and the Uniball delivers nicely at both .28mm and .38mm. However, those just aren&#8217;t my preferred ones!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out which gel pens you prefer, I can recommend the sampler sets &#8211; a variety of pens at a decent price in your favorite color!</p>

<p>I am shocked at how differently these inks look in photographs versus in person. Like those aura photos you can get at psychic fairs, these inks look so different but I&#8217;ll tell you how the colors look in person.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Troublemaker Sea Glass looks a lot like other sea-inspired colors I already had &#8212; Dominant Industry Seaweed and Vinta Sirena. Honestly, when writing, Sea Glass and Sirena are almost identical with subtle differences in the undertones. Sirena is a little more blue/brown than Seaweed or Sea Glass. When Sea Glass is applied more heavily it actually looks more similar to Ferris Wheel Moss Park Green not that you can tell from the sample above.  But really, Moss Park Green is a good alternate to Seaweed or Sea Glass or vice versa. In comparison, Robert Oster Sinner&#8217;s Weed is a very saturated grass green and a bit too bright for my taste.</p>
<p>I own both Vinta Ink Karnival Summer Green and Dominant Industry Atlantis which are very similar but Atlantis has shimmer and Karnival does not. I&#8217;d recommend choosing based on your own personal preference. I don&#8217;t use a lot of shimmer inks so really, I only need the Karnival ink.</p>
<p>Troublemaker Kelp Tea and Esterbrook Forgotten Iced Tea are almost identical on paper but look so different in the photo. Kelp Tea is a bit warmer reddish brown while Forgotten Iced Tea is a little cooler with blue undertones. But Troublemaker Kelp Tea is more accessible so if you were bummed to miss the Esterbrook Forgotten Iced Tea, Kelp Tea is a good alternative.</p>
<p>In my head, I thought Robest Oster Sydney Darling Harbour would be similar to DeAtramentis Pigeon Blue but it seems like Pigeon Blue is more more saturated. Darling Harbour has that deeper teal blue that I had always associated with Pigeon Blue. Weird, right?</p>
<p>This experiment showed me that I do tend to pick similar types of ink colors and that honestly, I don&#8217;t need all of them as full bottles. I have a bit of Sirena left and a whole bottle of Seaweed and Moss Park Green so I don&#8217;t need a whole bottle of Sea Glass, right? The same with Kelp Tea. I have a bottle of Forgotten Iced Tea so I don&#8217;t need both.</p>
<p>The Robert Oster Sydney Darling Harbour was the only ink samples I purchased that I did not have a similar color in my collection. I liked its teal-y deep tone with some greenish undertones. I might buy a bottle of this soon but this experiment definitely tempered my ink mania. I don&#8217;t need every bottle and I do tend to use the same colors over and over anyway.</p>
<p>Have you tried a similar experiment? What ink colors do you buy over and over?</p>

<p><a href="https://wellappointeddesk.bigcartel.com/category/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journal clips, decorative page markers and paper clips</a> are a great way to make your daily journal/planner tasks easier and more beautiful. I have become a diehard enthusiast in journal clips which help keep your pages flat while writing. Our journal clips are weighty and just the clip will help to keep pages down, clipped tight will keep a page from moving or wiggling around so your writing is more consistent and confident.</p>
<p>Page markers can make finding your page faster and shaped paper clips can also collect your ephemera or keep pages together, away from prying eyes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve added some new heavy duty journal clips and restocked some of our favorites from CoraCrea Creates and Creeping Moon. More are on the way soon so stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every February for many years Ana and I have worked together on a little personal challenge we call &#8220;Fix it, Finish it or Frog it February.&#8221; While we specifically relate this to knitting, we thought it could be applicable to any craft or hobby you pursue. So today&#8217;s post is brought to you with knitting in mind, but broader applications.</p>
<p>Anyone who goes ALL IN on a hobby knows that there is lots of collecting to be done. There are the primary materials (yarn, ink, paper), the tools (needles, hooks, pens) and endless accessories (don&#8217;t get me started!). We&#8217;ve all started at the entry level, and then moved deeper into the obsession and find ourselves with a collection teeming with favorites, as well as things that no longer serve us. Keep those in mind as I move forward.</p>
<h4>FIX IT</h4>
<p>Any knitter has started a project that at some point has taken a wrong turn. Here&#8217;s one of my current ones. I tried to knit a sweater in November 2024. I cast on, and kept going despite the fact that I had miscounted somewhere along the way (oops!), I had the niggling feeling that it was going to be too small (double oops!) and that I hadn&#8217;t alternated skeins and they were definitely different colors (triple oops!). What I ended up with was this pile of knitting that I knew I couldn&#8217;t continue, and just made me want to throw it in a corner. Which I did.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s now 2026 and this mess doesn&#8217;t suit me. It&#8217;s a waste of beautiful yarn, and it keeps my tools (needles, stitch markers and the like) otherwise occupied. It&#8217;s time to fix it. That&#8217;s going to include ripping it (more on this in a bit), but it&#8217;s time to make it what I want it to be. A pretty sweater that fits me that I want to wear proudly.</p>
<p>What do you have that isn&#8217;t working for you? That pen you love, but the nib isn&#8217;t quite right. The journal or planner you bought that would work for you if it wasn&#8217;t this one thing. The ink that might not work in the pen you put it in, but might have another use?</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s the time. Make a nib grinding appointment. Take a tour down a rabbit hole on YouTube and hack that planner until it works for you. Take up ink wash painting (and visit Julia Van der Wyk at the San Francisco Pen Show for a class on that!). In the immortal words of Tim Gunn, MAKE IT WORK. If you absolutely can&#8217;t, hold that thought.</p>
<h4>FINISH IT</h4>
<p>Every knitter has a project that&#8217;s almost done, but for a few simple things. You made the sweater all except for the final sleeve. You need to add buttons. There&#8217;s three ends sticking out that need to be woven in so it&#8217;s neat and tidy. You finished the first sock, but you never got to the second. Or, in my case, you knit 1/4 of a hat and stopped.</p>

<p>You could finish that project with just a little more work but you for some reason you stopped, went to the kitchen for a snack, and 3 years passed and you never got back to it. You still love it, and you want it finished (it&#8217;s cold out &#8211; I want to wear that hat RIGHT NOW!).</p>
<p>So do it. Get off your butt and finish coloring in your <a href="https://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2025/06/notebook-review-dominant-industry-ink-archiving-book-log-of-elixir-atlantis-edition/">Ink Archiving Book</a>. Finish that really cool zine or journal you were working on. Close out last year&#8217;s planner and file it on the shelf. Whatever it is you want to finish, DO IT. If you can, do those last little steps by the end of the month. You&#8217;ll feel a huge sense of accomplishment, less guilt hanging over you (if you ever feel that way!) and you&#8217;ll have a clean slate ready for new projects.</p>
<h4>FROG IT</h4>
<p>In knitting, when we have to undo our knitting we say we rip it (&#8220;ribbit&#8221;) and some of us call that frogging. There are just projects that weren&#8217;t meant to be. That ink you were sure you love, but just don&#8217;t. A pen that try as you might you just can&#8217;t like (I&#8217;m looking at you Lamy Safari angled grip). A planner that just doesn&#8217;t work for you.</p>
<p>For me, a sweater that I knit where the yarn and the pattern are a total mismatch. The yarn is lovely, but it tends to work better in a different stitch. See all those janky stitches where nice neat ones should be? The whole sweater is going to be like that and I&#8217;m never going to wear it. And I&#8217;m not even sure I want that particular sweater pattern anymore/ But that yarn is gorgeous. And in a different stitch/project could be amazing. Or maybe someone else would enjoy the yarn more.</p>

<p>Enough is enough. Face reality and do something about it. In my case, I&#8217;m gonna RIBBIT real good. In your case? Sell the pen, give away the ink, admit you hate the thing and let it go. Life is TOO SHORT to spend time doing things we don&#8217;t enjoy, especially things that are hobbies and supposed to be our happy place. Don&#8217;t get caught in the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost_fallacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sunk cost fallacy</a>, just Marie Kondo that shit and only keep what brings you joy. In my case, that means I will have ripped out this sweater and rewound the yarn by the time you read this post!</p>
