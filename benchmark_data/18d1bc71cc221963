					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://battlefieldanomalies.com/comment-page-1/#comment-210324&quot;&gt;Brett Bentley-Leek&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for contacting me Brett. Hope you find the site useful and worth a browse. I do not focus on battles fought here in England, but you will still find quite a few that involve the British army on foreign fields.
Nice to meet you, and hope we can have another natter sometime.
Regards,
Graham]]></description>

I totally agree with you concerning Bohemia, Andrew, as well as Moravia (Austerlitz).  Both Dr Bob and I would like to make another visit when possible.
Thanks for visiting our website.
Very best regards,

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant site, Graham, an absolute mine of information. Having lived and worked in Vienna and Mons over the final 13 years before my retirement at the end of 2013 I have visited many of these sites, the ones in Bohemia multiple times. I cannot recommend them too highly - well preserved, good beer, hearty cuisine, friendly people, beautiful countryside and towns. What’s not to like!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://battlefieldanomalies.com/comment-page-1/#comment-184585&quot;&gt;Eric Niderost&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for your kind remarks regarding this site Eric, much appreciated.
Rochambeau was very young at Laufeldt and was wounded while leading a battalion of the La Marche Regiment during the first attack. He could not have cheered on the Auvergne Regiment as they were in reserve and never actually saw action.
I have more details on troop formations which I will forward later.
Best wishes and good luck with your article.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Graham
 wonderful site! I teach history and write for a number of American history publications. Now doing Laufeldt-- and have come up with a problem-- the Comte de Rochambeau of American Revolution fame was wounded twice in that battle-- he was colonel of the Regiment de la Marche, yet there is NO reference to that Regiment at Laufeldt--yet there is a passing mention of him with the Auvergne Regiment, cheering them on&quot;--and evenyour map shows the Auvegne were there-at Laufeldt--I am writing an article-- any thoughts on this?-]]></description>

Greetings from a rather hot and humid Worcestershire Mick.
I like your website as it covers other world battlefield sites besides Europe. 
My friend and battlefield rambler Dr Robert Series is in charge of organizing all the various contact details on Battlefieldanomalies, and I am sure he will fix up a link between our sites so that we can share details.
Keep up the good work, eyes and boots are the only way to appreciate a campaign and a battlefield.
Best Regards,
Graham]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Graham, 

Love your site! I used your site to prepare for my visits to Koniggratz and Austerlitz a few years ago.  

After nearly 30 years of exploring battlefields all over the world, I have finally started gathering all my notes, photos, maps, letters, social media posts, documents etc in one place. 

My new website is www.battlefieldtravels.com  and is a travel blog focused on battlefields and a virtual museum.  Eventually there will be hundreds of battlefield studies on there as I work my way through.

Given that our audiences will overlap, I thought it would be useful to post links to each other&#039;s websites as &#039;further reading&#039; or &#039;recommended websites&#039;. 

Let me know what you think,

Mick]]></description>

Thank you for your communication concerning General Baron Guye Francois.

I would be very pleased to receive any information you may have in regard to the General, in particular the descendants on his brother side.  As I have stated in my short article on this site, the Guye family name seems to be particularly prevalent in the Jura area, any information you may have regarding the Generals parents would also be helpful.

Very best regards,

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Graham,
If you need to investigate more deeply on general Nicolas Philippe GUYE , Napoleon&#039;s officer, I can give some keys.
I&#039;m not descendant of Nicolas Philippe but from one of his brothers.
Nicolas had one son , Pierre Adolphe Janey-Guye  , from extra conjugal relation , dead 23 years old , not married , and two girls Hermine and Clélie born 1816.12.30 and 1819.01.31 at Saint Dié  .]]></description>
