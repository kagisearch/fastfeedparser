This is the kind of thinking that is both backward-looking and forward-looking, where I reflect on the year that has been and consider what I&apos;d like to be different in the coming year. <br><br>The main thing that comes to mind is that 2025 was a year when almost every moment of my time had to be devoted to parenting, managing the household, running <a href="https://www.interludewellness.com/?ref=speakingbody.com" rel="noreferrer">my practice</a>, hosting events like <a href="https://www.speakingbody.com/ceu" rel="noreferrer">CEUs</a> and <a href="https://www.speakingbody.com/linking-seminar-iv/">Linking Seminars</a>, and serving as the secretary of the <a href="https://lacaniancompass.com/?ref=speakingbody.com" rel="noreferrer">Lacanian Compass</a>. This left scant time for everything that did not fit into those big buckets, and even less time for the unstructured, usually slow, daydream-ish style of thinking that I find helpful to my overall sense of being a well-adjusted person in the world. </p><p>As I write those words, I feel a bit guilty because I&apos;m complaining... Given how good my life is, complaining feels wrong. Be that as it may, I&apos;m complaining. But rather than dwelling on this, I&apos;m going to move on. <br><br>The demands on my limited time and energy are not going to change in a way that makes it easier for me to engage in more of the reflective kind of thinking I long for. The seasons of my life that I&apos;m in now will continue to be the season I&apos;m in as the calendar year changes from 2025 to 2026. </p><p>Nonetheless, I want to find, create, and maintain new ways to make it more likely that I&apos;ll slow down and tune into my own head noise more frequently. That&apos;s my intention, my aim, what hope I&apos;ll be able to achieve to some degree. </p><p>The demands on my limited time and energy are not going to change in ways that make it easier for me to engage in more of the reflective thinking I long for.

Recording from my office before a day of clinical work, I think about the privilege of listening, the importance of &#x201C;regular&#x201D; places where relationships once accumulated, and how those spaces seem increasingly rare. Rather than simply criticizing technology, I explore a more balanced view&#x2014;drawing on Marc Weidenbaum&#x2019;s idea of being &#x201C;digitally cozy&#x201D;: staying engaged with books, walks, art, meals, and family while dialing back the constant churn of short-term online conversations. I also reflect on how meaningful relationships can form entirely through technologically mediated means, setting the stage for an upcoming interview that continues this conversation.</p><ul><li><strong>00:32</strong> Introduction and Reflections on Being a Psychoanalyst</li><li><strong>02:16</strong> Exploring the Concept of Place</li><li><strong>06:34</strong> Technology&#x2019;s Role in Social Interaction</li><li><strong>07:33</strong> Insights from Disquiet.com</li><li><strong>11:53</strong> Balancing Technology and Real Life</li><li><strong>16:44</strong> Upcoming Interview and Conclusion</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How we talk to (or don't talk to) others in places then & now]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h3 id="from-78-s2e026">From 78 S2.E026</h3>

After a hectic Thanksgiving with my family, I delve into the significance of physical places in making meaningful human connections, contrasting them with today&apos;s digital interactions. I highlight a particular episode of Craig Mod&apos;s newsletter &apos;Ridgelines&apos; that emphasizes the atmosphere of jazz kisaten in Japan and their unique social dynamics. I also share observations from my own life, pondering how modern technology and remote work have transformed communal spaces like cafes, affecting how people interact today.

This is not the same as rejecting power. It is, instead, <em>transforming</em> it. God&#x2019;s power is not human power. Our petty little attempts to impose our will by dominance, force and violence mean nothing to the Father, who scorns them. Power is wielded through love; power is wielded through sacrifice. There is something vast and oceanic about it. It is what greatness actually looks like. </blockquote><p>Reading this calls to mind the psychoanalytic idea of castration, the way that Lacanians use this concept in particular. Kingsnorth&apos;s prose clearly establishes the difference between people who try to act in a non-castrated way (&quot;petty little attempts to impose our will by dominance, force, and violence&quot;) and those who operate from a position of castration (&quot;Power is wielded through love [...] through sacrifice&quot;). </p><p>I think it leans into the counterintuitive way that not rejecting our castration can help us live better lives. </p><p>Later, in the same post, Kingsnorth writes: </p><blockquote>I can write these words, but I&#x2019;m not sure I really understand them. I certainly don&#x2019;t practice them - and yet, sometimes, in a split second of time, there will come a moment when, in fact, I do. Just for a second, in prayer or in everyday life, something will happen and the veil will twitch and I will see what all of this really means and how I can live it. Then it falls away again, and so do I. But it happens. It is possible. </blockquote><p>This, too, shows something I experience as profound. Being a castrated subject and acting as such is not natural or normal for people. (Or, even if it is natural and normal for some people, it&apos;s not for me.) </p><p>Be that as it may, when I can do it, I don&apos;t get to linger in what I&apos;ve done and feel wonderful about it. Life goes on, and I&apos;m back in the grind of things. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interview with Rob Bell]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h3 id="from-78-s2e024">From 78 S2.E024 </h3>

He discusses the shift from anger and judgment in his younger years to a more compassionate and understanding outlook as he grew older. Neil revisits previous themes, references the poem &apos;The Prophet&apos; by Kahlil Gibran, and shares insights about the natural progression of becoming a steward of the world. He also discusses the contrasting paths people may take as they age&#x2014;either moving towards compassion or becoming increasingly bitter. Join Neil as he explores the complexities of time, growth, and the importance of compassion.<br><br><strong>Warning:&#xA0;</strong><br><br>This episode is a self-referential reflection<strong>,</strong>&#xA0;where I revisit some of the themes from prior episodes. It is very rambly, so if you like that kind of thing, you&apos;ll like this one. And, if you don&apos;t like rambling episodes, you should probably skip this one.&#xA0;<br><br><strong>Themes &amp;</strong>&#xA0;<strong>Returning Themes:</strong>&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Dwelling in the house of Tomorrow when you&apos;re young, and moving out into the world of the present.</li><li>The shift from being one who is going to inherit the world to someone who has inherited the world and is now a steward of that world.</li><li>The loss of youth, the future, a large stack of tomorrows.... This makes some people soften and become more compassionate, and others harden and become bitter and brittle.&#xA0;</li></ul><p><strong>Referenced:</strong>&#xA0;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.kahlilgibran.com/images/The%20Prophet%20Ebook%20by%20Kahlil%20Gibran.pdf?ref=speakingbody.com">The Prophet</a>, by&#xA0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran?ref=speakingbody.com"><strong>Kahlil</strong>&#xA0;<strong>Gibran</strong></a></li><li>F78&#xA0;<a href="https://from78.transistor.fm/s2/15?ref=speakingbody.com">Episode 015</a>&#xA0;</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cave?ref=speakingbody.com">Nick Cave</a>&#xA0;(<a href="https://www.nickcave.com/faith-hope-and-carnage/?ref=speakingbody.com"><em>Faith, Hope, &amp; Carnage</em></a>;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/?ref=speakingbody.com"><em>The Red Hand Files</em></a>)&#xA0;</li><li>F78&#xA0;<a href="https://from78.transistor.fm/s2/17?ref=speakingbody.com">Episode 017&#xA0;</a></li><li>F78&#xA0;<a href="https://from78.transistor.fm/s2/18?ref=speakingbody.com">Episode 018</a>&#xA0;</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audio Time Travel, Technology, & Quantum Leap]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h3 id="from78-s22e019">From78 S2.2E019</h3>
