<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The key reads this week are The New York Times&#8217; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/business/media/view-of-ferguson-thrust-michael-brown-shooting-to-national-attention.html?_r=0">David Carr</a> on the role of Twitter in informing the world about Ferguson, a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/20/james-foley-daily-horrors-internet-think-clicking-beheading">pair </a>of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/21/twitter-free-speech-champion-selective-censor">posts</a> by The Guardian&#8217;s James Ball on the social media dissemination and censorship of ISIS&#8217; video of James Foley, and Clay Shirky on <a href="https://medium.com/@<a href="http://twitter.com/cshirky" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="View cshirky's Twitter Profile">cshirky</a>/last-call-c682f6471c70">the endgame for newspapers</a> and journalists there.</p>
<p><strong>Police aggressiveness and media coverage in Ferguson</strong>: In the second week of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police, the targeting, threats, and violence toward journalists only escalated, with at least <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/ferguson-journalists-arrested/">six more journalists arrested</a>, including <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/264189/getty-photographer-arrested-in-ferguson/">Getty Images photographer Scott Olson</a>. Ryan Devereaux, a reporter for First Look Media&#8217;s The Intercept, <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/19/intercept-reporter-detained-covering-ferguson-protests/">spent the night in jail</a>, being arrested (though not charged) because of &#8220;failure to disperse,&#8221; as he explained in a <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/19/ferguson/">first-person account</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the arrests, at least four reporters caught police on tape threatening to <a href="http://gawker.com/ferguson-police-threaten-to-shoot-reporter-and-mace-chr-1623125660">mace, shoot</a>, &#8220;<a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2014/8/18/police-to-al-jazeerajournalistinfergusonillbustyourass.html">bust your head</a>,&#8221; or <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/20/police-officer-suspended-for-pointing-rifle-at-protesters-threatening-them/">kill</a> them. (The officer who made the latter threat was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/20/police-officer-suspended-for-pointing-rifle-at-protesters-threatening-them/">suspended</a>.) Forty-eight media organizations <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263847/48-news-orgs-send-letter-protesting-lack-of-information-in-ferguson/">signed a letter</a> protesting the violent treatment of journalists and the lack of information being provided about those incidents and Brown&#8217;s shooting. As the week went on, journalists began being <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/ferguson-reporters-media-110080.html#ixzz3AZmzztDH">harassed and threatened by protesters</a> as well when they attempted to record looting.</p>
<p>Bob Butler, president of the National Association of Black Journalists, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/opinion/butler-ferguson-arrests-journalists/index.html">chastised the police</a> for their disturbingly aggressive behavior, and The Huffington Post&#8217;s Jack Mirkinson <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/17/reporters-ferguson-press-freedom_n_5685767.html">made the case</a> for why the treatment of reporters matters: When police arrest or threaten journalists, it&#8217;s not just about them. &#8220;They are trying to decrease the flow of information that the journalists can provide the rest of us. They are trying to keep all of us in the dark,&#8221; he wrote. The Washington Post&#8217;s Paul Farhi <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/with-no-textbooks-on-how-to-cover-riots-reporters-in-ferguson-learning-as-they-go/2014/08/18/e942cff4-2716-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html">explained</a> how reporters were adjusting to the stonewalling and danger in a situation that ranged beyond what many of them had ever been trained for, and on Medium, Quinn Norton <a href="https://medium.com/message/dressed-for-excess-47a89d343a06">gave some useful advice</a> for reporters on covering civil unrest. The Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Jonathan Peters <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/press_rights_in_ferguson.php?page=all">added a primer for journalists</a> on their First Amendment rights in these situations.</p>
<p>A few publications highlighted the stellar work being done by journalists in Ferguson: The Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Deron Lee <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/local_coverage_ferguson_michae.php?page=all">gave a thorough review</a> of the excellent coverage by local news organizations, and Time&#8217;s Olivier Laurent <a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2014/08/20/ferguson-michael-brown-st-louis-photographers/#1">went behind the coverage</a> by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch&#8217;s photojournalists, while Poynter&#8217;s Benjamin Mullin <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/264027/how-st-louis-alt-weekly-is-covering-the-chaos-in-ferguson/">looked at the work</a> the Riverfront Times, St. Louis&#8217; alt-weekly, has done on the protests. The Huffington Post <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/20/ferguson-fellowship_n_5696323.html">announced</a> it would establish a crowdfunded fellowship with the St. Louis Beacon to keep a reporter in Ferguson for the next year, though many, including The Awl&#8217;s<a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/08/journalism-funded"> Matt Buchanan</a>, Ad Age&#8217;s <a href="http://adage.com/article/the-media-guy/huffpo-crowdfund-nip-slip-coverage/294666/">Simon Dumenco</a>, and 10,000 Words&#8217; <a href="https://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/huffpo-crowdfunds-ferguson-reporter_b28640">Karen Fratti</a>, wondered why such a massive media organization is crowdfunding a position it should be able to easily pay for itself. Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/21/why-its-smart-of-the-huffpo-to-partner-with-beacon-reader-in-crowdfunding-a-reporter/">argued that it&#8217;s a smart move</a> for both HuffPo and the Beacon.</p>
<p>There were some questions about the media&#8217;s behavior in Ferguson, though. Photojournalist Abe Van Dyke <a href="http://thevandykecollection.com/embarrassed-to-photograph-ferguson/">explained why he was embarrassed</a> to be part of the media in Ferguson — it reached a point, he said, where the media was &#8220;no longer simply reporting what is happening but rather becoming a hindrance and making the situation worse.&#8221; Ryan Schuessler, who had been covering Ferguson with Al Jazeera America, also <a href="http://ryanschuessler.com/2014/08/21/i-will-not-be-returning-to-ferguson/">expressed disgust</a> at the media&#8217;s tone-deaf behavior, concluding that <strong>&#8220;In the beginning there was a recognizable need for media presence, but this is the other extreme. They need time to work through this as a community, without the cameras.&#8221;</strong> Similarly, BagNews&#8217; Michael Shaw said the <a href="http://www.bagnewsnotes.com/2014/08/ferguson-and-the-press/">media presence has gotten so heavy</a> that it&#8217;s become difficult to tell what&#8217;s the story and what&#8217;s spectacle.</p>
<p>Noah Rothman of the conservative blog Hot Air <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/19/is-the-press-in-ferguson-behaving-irresponsibly/">questioned</a> whether the press was too closely identifying itself with the protesters, a point <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/has-the-media-gone-too-far-in-ferguson-194166.html">echoed</a> by Politico&#8217;s Dylan Byers. But Slate&#8217;s Josh Voorhees <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/why_the_media_is_siding_with_the_ferguson_protesters_reporters_and_demonstrators.single.html">countered</a> that the press is siding with protesters because &#8220;what the people in the streets of Ferguson want is the same thing the journalists were sent there to find&#8221; — namely, the truth about Michael Brown&#8217;s killing. M. Scott Brauer of the photojournalism blog dvafoto <a href="http://www.dvafoto.com/2014/08/on-ferguson-a-fascinating-study-of-visual-politics-race-the-police-and-the-media/">provided a good roundup</a> of the discussion of both police brutality toward journalists and media coverage of the protests.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Following Ferguson on Twitter</strong>: Much of this action on the streets in Ferguson was reaching us through the filter of Twitter, which for many people was a nonstop feed of the latest reports, photos, and video from both professional reporters and protesters. The New York Times&#8217; David Carr <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/business/media/view-of-ferguson-thrust-michael-brown-shooting-to-national-attention.html?_r=0">argued</a> that this story highlights one of Twitter&#8217;s greatest strengths in its ability to capture the interests and informational needs of a broad range of news consumers that the traditional media often misses, including communities of color. Politico&#8217;s Byron Tau <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/how-the-media-discovered-ferguson-110072.html">explained</a> that it took the arrests of two reporters last week for Ferguson to finally grab the establishment political press&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>There are downsides to the way Twitter mediates events like Ferguson&#8217;s protests as well: Politico&#8217;s Alex Byers <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/ferguson-social-media-more-spark-than-solution-110202.html">talked to several experts</a> who said <strong>Twitter&#8217;s free-for-all nature fused with the chaos in Ferguson &#8220;to create an environment that spotlights startling developments over measured action or solutions.&#8221;</strong> Still, many users have remarked on how much better Twitter has been for following the situation in Ferguson than Facebook, which has been inundated with videos of people being dumped with buckets of ice water for most of the week.</p>
<p>Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/18/twitter-vs-facebook-as-a-news-source-ferguson-shows-the-downsides-of-an-algorithmic-filter/">highlighted several reasons</a> for the differences between the two platforms, focusing on Facebook&#8217;s symmetrical following model and the algorithms behind its News Feed. Likewise, Poynter&#8217;s Sam Kirkland <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263987/on-the-facebookification-of-twitter-and-the-twitterfication-of-facebook/">noted</a> that Facebook&#8217;s algorithm has prioritized personalized relevance over newness, which hurts it for minute-by-minute stories like Ferguson. The American Journalism Review&#8217;s Lisa Rossi <a href="http://ajr.org/2014/08/20/getting-news-ferguson/">advised readers</a> to spread their news consumption across platforms, and Mandy Brown of The Verge <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/18/6030921/byron-the-bulb-how-the-velocity-of-journalism-is-changing">called for more transparent and sophisticated filters</a> that can help us comprehend information at the same speed we&#8217;re sharing it.</p>
<p>The Guardian&#8217;s Dan Gillmor <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/16/fergusons-citizen-journalists-video">praised the citizen journalism</a> coming out of Ferguson, particularly the valuable documentation of police brutality. At the Local News Lab, Josh Stearns looked at <a href="http://localnewslab.org/2014/08/20/local-newsrooms-as-participatory-journalism-labs/">what local journalists can do</a> to aid community-driven information efforts like those fueling the Ferguson story, and journalism professor Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2014/08/16/social-journalism-ferguson/">emphasized the importance</a> of journalists to start serving communities by listening to and understanding them, rather than charging in from the outside.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>A brutal execution, and censorship questions</strong>: The Islamic militant group ISIS posted a video on YouTube this week of its execution of freelance photojournalist James Foley, who was kidnapped in Syria two years ago. As The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/middleeast/isis-james-foley-syria-execution.html">explained</a>, the video was meant to intimidate the U.S. into stopping its airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, and concluded with a threat to kill another freelance journalist. President Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/us/politics/james-foley-beheading-isis-video-authentic-obama.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0">said he was appalled</a> by Foley&#8217;s beheading but declared he would continue the airstrikes, and Obama administration officials <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-weighs-response-to-apparent-execution-of-american-by-islamic-state/2014/08/20/e33558a8-287d-11e4-8593-da634b334390_story.html">revealed</a> they had tried and failed a secret operation to rescue Foley earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reuters&#8217; Jack Shafer <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2014/08/20/the-islamic-state-buys-itself-a-day-of-horror-little-else-by-killing-james-foley/">traced some of the history</a> of videotaped murders of journalists and argued that ISIS will accomplish none of its goals regarding American policy and public opinion as a result of this video, though it may serve as an effective recruiting tool. The New York Times&#8217; Ravi Somaiya and Christine Haughney <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/world/middleeast/from-arrests-to-beheadings-conflict-reporting-takes-harsh-toll-on-journalists.html">examined the immense dangers</a> journalists are facing both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Foley&#8217;s friends and colleagues paid tribute to his immense courage and selflessness. You can get a good sense of the kind of man he was through articles by Vox&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/8/19/6046367/on-james-foley">Max Fisher</a>, CNN&#8217;s <a href="http://us.cnn.com/2014/08/20/us/james-foley-life/index.html">Brian Stelter</a>, and BuzzFeed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/this-is-how-we-should-remember-james-foley#13kau6w">Sheera Frenkel</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion also shifted to the spread of the video on social media, as <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/08/19/james-foley-video-journalists/">journalists voiced their opposition</a> to other journalists and news organizations who posted screenshots and clips from the video. In the U.K., <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/20/police-warn-james-foley-video-crime-social-media">police warned</a> that sharing and even viewing the video could be grounds for arrest under terrorism legislation, something Techdirt&#8217;s Mike Masnick <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140820/12004128267/theres-reasonable-debate-to-be-had-about-showing-james-foley-beheading-video-claiming-its-illegal-to-watch-is-ridiculous.shtml">scoffed at</a>. News organizations that published images from the video, several of them <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/21/news-corp-australia-defends-james-foley-beheading-images">tabloids belonging to News Corp</a>, defended their decisions.</p>
<p>As Foreign Policy&#8217;s <a href="http://complex.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/08/19/social_media_companies_scramble_to_block_terrorist_video_of_journalists_murder">Shane Harris</a> and The Guardian&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/20/james-foley-how-social-media-is-fighting-back-against-isis-propaganda">Hannah Jane Parkinson</a> reported, the social networks themselves, particularly YouTube and Twitter, scrambled to block the photo, with Twitter suspending accounts that post graphic images. Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/20/should-twitter-and-youtube-remove-images-of-james-foleys-beheading-or-do-we-have-a-right-to-see-them/">objected to that decision</a>, arguing that the decision over whether to view images or footage from the execution should be our decision as users.</p>
<p>The Guardian&#8217;s James Ball <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/21/twitter-free-speech-champion-selective-censor">pointed out the departure</a> of this decision from Twitter&#8217;s very laissez-faire past on free speech. He concluded that &#8220;if Twitter has decided to make editorial decisions, even on a limited basis, it is vital that its criteria are clearly and openly stated in advance, and that they are consistently and evenly applied,&#8221; and PandoDaily&#8217;s David Holmes also <a href="http://pando.com/2014/08/20/twitter-suspends-users-that-share-graphic-james-foley-images-unless-youre-a-new-york-tabloid/">called for consistency</a> on Twitter&#8217;s part. The Berkman Center&#8217;s David Weinberger <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/21/opinion/weinberger-twitter-beheading/index.html">noted what a difficult decision</a> this is for YouTube and Twitter, saying that by becoming used as a news distribution system, &#8220;Twitter has been vested with a responsibility, and a trust, it did not ask for.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the personal decision to view, The Guardian&#8217;s Ball <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/20/james-foley-daily-horrors-internet-think-clicking-beheading">urged serious self-examination</a> before clicking on such links, while also wondering if we&#8217;re disproportionately concerned about graphic images of white Westerners. And Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/twitter-and-the-special-relationship#13kau6w">used this as an example</a> of the downside of Twitter&#8217;s (generally) unfiltered stream of news.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: There were a few stories about the media this week that didn&#8217;t have to do with violence and repression. Here&#8217;s a sampling:</p>
<p>— Gawker <a href="http://gawker.com/time-inc-rates-writers-on-how-beneficial-they-are-to-1623253026">published an internal Time Inc. spreadsheet</a>. obtained from a union representative, that showed that Sports Illustrated online staffers are being evaluated based on, among other things, producing &#8220;content that [is] beneficial to advertiser relationship.&#8221; Those evaluations may have played a role in SI&#8217;s recent layoffs. A Time Inc. exec <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/18/media/time-inc-writer-advertiser-evaluaton/">&#8220;clarified&#8221; to CNN&#8217;s Brian Stelter</a> that that evaluation means &#8220;Does what they create or who they are capture the attention of Madison Avenue?&#8221; which, <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/the-media-is-dying-cont-194107.html">as Politico&#8217;s Dylan Byers noted</a>, sounds like kind of the same thing. Time&#8217;s Norman Pearlstine <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/time-inc-spreadsheet-gate-not-a-big-deal.html">gave a further defense</a> to New York&#8217;s Gabriel Sherman, calling the reaction overblown.</p>
<p>— After <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/08/05/twitter-feed-friends-follow/">experimenting</a> with the change earlier this summer, Twitter <a href="http://qz.com/252192/twitter-now-officially-says-your-timeline-is-more-than-just-tweets-from-people-you-follow/">officially added some favorited tweets</a> from people you follow to users&#8217; feeds. It seems <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/20/twitter-tweets-timeline-follow">exactly no one</a> liked the change, and The Atlantic&#8217;s Robinson Meyer said that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/twitter-starts-to-change-the-central-logic-of-its-service/378650/">while we have already been seeing tweets from people we don&#8217;t follow</a> in our streams (those would be ads), this change is damaging because it breaks Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;favorite&#8221; function, and TechCrunch&#8217;s Natasha Lomas <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/20/crap/">made a similar point</a> a bit more bluntly.</p>
<p>— The anonymous duo who busted BuzzFeed&#8217;s Benny Johnson for serial plagiarism <a href="http://ourbadmedia.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/did-cnn-the-washington-post-and-time-actually-check-fareed-zakarias-work-for-plagiarism/">went after CNN&#8217;s Fareed Zakaria</a> this week, accusing him of lifting from a wide variety of publications. Zakaria was accused of plagiarism in 2012, and a spokesman for Time magazine, which reviewed his work at that point, <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/264411/after-new-plagiarism-allegations-time-magazine-will-review-zakarias-work-again/">said it would review his material again</a>, though The Washington Post and CNN <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/plagiarism-watchdogs-target-fareed-zakaria-194178.html">said they saw nothing</a> in these new allegations to justify a new review. Zakaria <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/fareed-zakaria-responds-to-plagiarism-charges-194196.html">offered his own defense</a> to Politico&#8217;s Dylan Byers, and Steve Buttry <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/attribution-quotation-marks-and-links-they-turn-plagiarism-into-research/">gave some tips</a> for avoiding plagiarism through attribution and linking.</p>
<p>— Finally, three very smart pieces on where the news business is headed: Journalism professor Nikki Usher in the Columbia Journalism Review with some insights into her research on the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/third_party_recommendation_app.php?page=all">new wave of news aggregation apps</a>, French newspaper exec Frederic Filloux on the <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/08/17/the-future-of-mobile-apps-for-news/">future of mobile news apps</a>, and NYU professor Clay Shirky with a <a href="https://medium.com/@<a href="http://twitter.com/cshirky" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="View cshirky's Twitter Profile">cshirky</a>/last-call-c682f6471c70">warning call</a> to journalists working in newspapers.</p>

<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: This week&#8217;s most important pieces are <a href="https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0">Zeynep Tufekci</a> on Ferguson and algorithmic filtering, <a href="https://medium.com/@<a href="http://twitter.com/felixsalmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="View felixsalmon's Twitter Profile">felixsalmon</a>/normally-when-some-big-deal-is-announced-in-the-business-world-a-rah-rah-press-release-goes-out-236f5ae86ee4">Felix Salmon</a> on BuzzFeed, and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/?single_page=true">Ethan Zuckerman</a> on the failings of the ad-based business model on which the Internet runs.</p>
<p><strong>Press freedom and citizen journalism in Ferguson</strong>: The ongoing tensions in Ferguson, Missouri this week that followed a police officer&#8217;s killing of an unarmed black teenager became a major story about the media as well when <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263209/huffpost-washington-post-reporters-arrested-in-ferguson/">two reporters were arrested</a> without any apparent justification Wednesday night and <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263287/journalists-fight-through-tear-gas-sirens-smoke-to-report-on-ferguson/">numerous others</a> were tear-gassed or shot with rubber bullets by police. The two reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of The Huffington Post, were arrested as police cleared out a McDonalds they were in. They were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/washington-post-reporter-arrested-in-ferguson/">released about a half-hour after they arrived at the police station</a>, after a phone call from a Los Angeles Times reporter alerted the police chief to their arrests. Lowery <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-ferguson-washington-post-reporter-wesley-lowery-gives-account-of-his-arrest/2014/08/13/0fe25c0e-2359-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html">wrote a first-person account</a> of the incident.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/videos/news/local/2014/08/14/14042891/">video showed an Al Jazeera America crew getting hit with tear gas</a> and fleeing, followed quickly by a SWAT team dismantling their equipment. Law enforcement officials <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/police-tear-gas-not-fired-at-al-jazeera-news-crew-intentionally-video/">claimed the gassing was unintentional</a>. Poynter&#8217;s <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/263473/local-tv-journalists-say-police-encounters-are-mixed-in-ferguson/">Al Tompkins</a> and <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/262191/st-louis-photographer-on-scene-at-riots-this-is-my-job/">Kristen Hare</a> reported on the experiences of several local reporters on the scene, and Ellyn Angelotti <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/263345/during-protests-police-may-balance-journalists-rights-with-public-safety/">provided some legal background</a> on what police are able to do to journalists during protests.</p>
<p>Journalism professor Jeremy Littau <a href="http://jlittau.net/?name=465">noted the outrage</a> expressed over Lowery and Reilly&#8217;s arrests, and called on journalists to stand up for citizens&#8217; rights alongside professional reporters&#8217;, especially since they have been so vital in disseminating information about events such as the Ferguson protests. Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/14/crowd-powered-journalism-becomes-crucial-when-traditional-media-is-unwilling-or-unable/">argued</a> that in situations where traditional journalists can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t witness abusive police behavior, the crowd-powered platforms like Twitter can be an important check on authority, and Jezebel&#8217;s Kara Brown said the events in Ferguson <a href="http://jezebel.com/how-fergusons-twitter-users-woke-the-media-the-fuck-up-1621710724">have shown how traditional and social media can complement each other</a> to draw attention to abuses of power.</p>
<p>Sociology professor Zeynep Tufekci <a href="https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0">noted how discussion on Twitter</a> about Ferguson bubbled up all week and then boiled over Wednesday night, then pointed out how quiet it was on Facebook at the same time, making the case that the algorithms that filter online information have significant (and unexamined) consequences regarding what issues get public attention. Sarah Perez of Techcrunch also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/why-ferguson-wasnt-trending-for-some-social-media-users-last-night/">explained</a> why Ferguson was only rarely trending on Twitter and Facebook on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Before Wednesday night&#8217;s arrests and confrontations, Twitter and Instagram also helped give exposure to criticism of media coverage of Ferguson with the hashtag #<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23IfTheyGunnedMeDown" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Search Twitter for &quot;IfTheyGunnedMeDown&quot;">IfTheyGunnedMeDown</a>, in which black users showed contrasting pictures of themselves and questioned which one the news media would run. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/us/if-they-gunned-me-down-protest-on-twitter.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a> and the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/iftheygunnedmedown-ferguson-shooting-sparks-debate/ngzYw/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> both covered the trend, and Poynter&#8217;s team of experts <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/262891/iftheygunnedmedown-challenges-the-media-and-how-it-portrays-people-of-color/">weighed in as well</a>.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>A $50 million infusion for BuzzFeed</strong>: BuzzFeed took a big step forward beyond listicles this week, getting a <a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/08/10/buzzfeed/">$50 million investment</a> from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz that will fund a major expansion that includes new content sections, a technology incubator, and more funds for its video division BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. Chris Dixon, an Andreessen Horowitz partner who will join BuzzFeed&#8217;s board, <a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/08/10/buzzfeed/">explained</a> why the firm is making the investment, and The New York Times&#8217; Mike Isaac <a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/08/10/buzzfeed/">laid out</a> what BuzzFeed will do with the money, while the Lab&#8217;s Caroline O&#8217;Donovan <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/08/with-50-million-buzzfeed-growth-calls-for-sharper-lines-between-news-and-the-other-stuff/">went into more detail</a> about its new, more autonomous divisions: Buzz, BuzzFeed News, and BuzzFeed Life.</p>
<p>One aspect of the announcement that caught quite a bit of attention was Dixon&#8217;s statement that his firm views BuzzFeed as more of a tech company than a media company. Gawker and New York Observer alum Elizabeth Spiers <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/08/elizabeth-spiers-on-buzzfeed-and-other-tech-companies-youre-still-a-media-company/">objected</a> to that description, and tech writer Ben Thompson <a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/buzzfeed-tech-company/">sifted through the claim</a>, concluding that while BuzzFeed is still primarily a media company, it has a disconnect from traditional media logic and an ability to cheaply scale that make it uniquely valuable.</p>
<p>Recode&#8217;s Peter Kafka <a href="http://recode.net/2014/08/11/how-jonah-peretti-and-buzzfeed-got-to-850-million/">looked at BuzzFeed&#8217;s $850 million valuation</a> and said that if BuzzFeed is a media company, then that number is a huge overvaluation, but if it&#8217;s a tech company, it&#8217;s a steal. And for everyone saying &#8220;$850 million for a bunch of listicles and cat GIFs?!&#8221; Fusion&#8217;s Felix Salmon <a href="https://medium.com/@<a href="http://twitter.com/felixsalmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="View felixsalmon's Twitter Profile">felixsalmon</a>/normally-when-some-big-deal-is-announced-in-the-business-world-a-rah-rah-press-release-goes-out-236f5ae86ee4">argued</a> that BuzzFeed is different from other media companies in that it doesn&#8217;t sell audiences to advertisers, but instead sells its expertise in creating content that young, mobile audiences love. <strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>The best way to think of BuzzFeed’s various products, then, is probably as a proof of concept: it’s a way to show advertisers that the company is able to reach a large, young, mobile, social audience in a multitude of different ways,&#8221;</strong> Salmon wrote.</p>
<p>Wired&#8217;s Marcus Wohlsen <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/buzzfeed-is-the-apple-of-media-and-everyone-else-is-microsoft/">examined</a> what it means for BuzzFeed to be, as Dixon called it, a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; startup, and investor Om Malik <a href="http://om.co/2014/08/11/buzzfeed-the-attention-game/">looked at the potential hazards</a> for BuzzFeed, specifically its reliance on Facebook and the continued success of native advertising. The Awl&#8217;s Matt Buchanan <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/08/content-distributed">noted</a> that BuzzFeed is moving even deeper into Facebook and other social networks, creating content that only exists there, rather than on BuzzFeed&#8217;s site. And TechCrunch&#8217;s Josh Constine said the native ads on which BuzzFeed depends <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/12/buzzhome/">may be a fickle form</a>.</p>
<p>As Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/11/can-a-billion-dollar-media-entity-be-run-like-a-startup-buzzfeed-gets-50m-to-find-out/">pointed out</a>, BuzzFeed&#8217;s investors are betting that it can scale into a massive media company without losing the agility it has so prized, and Bloomberg Businessweek&#8217;s Felix Gillette <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-12/can-buzzfeed-build-a-newfangled-media-conglomerate-with-50-million">noted</a> that its cost of production and scale of competition are about to increase just as dramatically as its cash on hand. The New York Times&#8217; Claire Cain Miller <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/upshot/why-buzzfeed-is-trying-to-shift-its-strategy.html?smid=tw-share">explored</a> BuzzFeed&#8217;s move toward higher-quality content and the larger accompanying shift online from search to social.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Mike Shields of The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/08/12/the-huffington-post-grapples-with-buzzfeeds-ascendancy/">looked at the deal&#8217;s implications</a> for one of BuzzFeed&#8217;s biggest competitors, The Huffington Post, and Forbes&#8217; Eric Jackson made the case that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/08/12/yahoo-should-have-bought-buzzfeed-instead-of-tumblr-and-the-seven-dwarfs-of-acqui-hires/">Yahoo should have bought BuzzFeed</a>. Gawker&#8217;s J.K. Trotter noticed that BuzzFeed has <a href="http://gawker.com/over-4-000-buzzfeed-posts-have-completely-disappeared-1619473070">removed more than 4,000 posts this year</a>, and Slate&#8217;s Will Oremus <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/08/buzzfeed_plagiarism_deleted_posts_jonah_peretti_explains.single.html">talked to BuzzFeed&#8217;s Jonah Peretti about why</a>: The posts didn&#8217;t meet its editorial standards for a variety of reasons, and they were created before BuzzFeed saw itself as journalistic. Poynter&#8217;s Kelly McBride looked at the <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/creating-a-framework-for-ethical-decision-making-among-journalists-and-those-who-care-about-democracy/262829/if-you-must-unpublish-heres-how-to-maintain-credibility/">ethics of unpublishing</a> in light of the situation.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gannett&#8217;s spinoff and future of print</strong>: Gannett became the latest media company to spin its print properties off from its broadcast properties into a separate company last week, <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gannett-separate-broadcasting-publishing-businesses-723375">announcing a split</a> set to take place next year with the broadcasting unit assuming all of the company&#8217;s debt. The Lab&#8217;s Ken Doctor, who had <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/08/the-newsonomics-of-splitting-up-media-companies-with-gannett-maybe-next/">suggested just a day before the announcement</a> that Gannett could use such a split, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/08/ken-doctor-10-takeaways-from-gannetts-blockbuster-announcements/">gave several observations</a> on the current wave of breakups, arguing that despite the initial cash infusion for newspaper units, they&#8217;ll ultimately result in less of a financial cushion for those properties.</p>
<p>Journalism professor Jeff Jarvis <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2014/08/05/decootification-media-companies/">argued</a> that these newspaper companies are being spun off because the business is going to continue to get worse and they&#8217;re punting on the work of transforming it. <strong>&#8220;What these spin-offs signals is that media companies do not have the stomach, patience, capital, or guts to do the hard work that is still needed to finish turning around legacy media,&#8221;</strong> he wrote. The New York Times&#8217; David Carr <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/business/media/media-companies-spin-off-newspapers-to-uncertain-futures.html">painted a similarly depressing picture</a> of the spun-off newspaper industry, but concluded that its decline is no one&#8217;s fault in particular. Jarvis <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2014/08/11/absolution-hell/">countered</a> that the decline of newspapers has indeed been journalists&#8217; fault, and it should prompt not fatalism but renewed action and innovation.</p>
<p>At USA Today, Michael Wolff was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/08/10/newspapers-on-their-own/13772095/">more optimistic</a>, seeing some potential for newspapers to rethink what business they&#8217;re in and reinvent themselves. And Poynter&#8217;s Rick Edmonds said <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/business-news/the-biz-blog/262255/death-of-newspapers-announced-prematurely-yet-again/">there&#8217;s no reason to declare these newspaper spinoffs failures</a> before they even occur, and USA Today&#8217;s Rem Rieder said <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2014/08/06/newspapers-out-on-their-own/13674487/">there&#8217;s a way forward</a> for newspapers despite print&#8217;s decline: Find enough in digital subscriptions and advertising to keep revenue flat after years of declines. The Atlantic&#8217;s Derek Thompson <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/a-terrible-year-for-newspapers-a-great-year-for-news/375859/">added</a> that while there&#8217;s no certain model for making money off of news, there are several promising avenues, many of them in digital-native outfits or organizations with substantial private funds behind them.</p>
<p>Gannett also announced it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/261916/gannett-exec-goal-of-reshuffled-newsrooms-is-to-invest-fewest-resources-necessary-in-production/">restructuring the newsrooms at five of its papers</a> to cut down on resources for editing and design while increasing the emphasis on analytics, as Poynter&#8217;s Sam Kirkland reported. The Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Corey Hutchins <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/gannetts_changes_bring_excitement_some_pain_and_a_full-time_beer_beat.php?page=all">talked to an editor</a> of one of the papers about what the changes will mean, and Jim Romenesko <a href="http://jimromenesko.com/2014/08/06/cincinnati-enquirer-journalists-also-have-to-reapply-for-their-jobs/">rounded up details</a> of the news that journalists have to re-apply for their jobs, as well as the <a href="http://jimromenesko.com/2014/08/08/here-are-the-new-jobs-being-offered-to-gannett-journalists/">new job descriptions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Anonymity and abuse in Gawker comments</strong>: Writers at the Gawker blog Jezebel <a href="http://jezebel.com/we-have-a-rape-gif-problem-and-gawker-media-wont-do-any-1619384265">went public this week</a> with their complaints about Gawker&#8217;s inaction on an anonymous commenter posting pornographic rape GIFs, upsetting both readers and the staff members who have to remove the comments. Jezebel editor-in-chief Jessica Coen <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/262337/jezebel-staffers-wanted-to-light-a-fire-under-managements-collective-ass/">told Poynter</a> the staff published its post &#8220;to light a fire under management’s collective ass.”</p>
<p>Gawker responded by first <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/262773/jezebel-editor-on-disabled-image-uploads-a-temporary-band-aid-isnt-enough/">disabling all images in comments</a> as a temporary solution, then <a href="http://jezebel.com/what-gawker-media-is-doing-about-our-rape-gif-problem-1620742504">bringing back its old pending comment system</a>, in which only comments from approved users are immediately visible, and the rest are put in a separate &#8220;pending&#8221; queue that&#8217;s visible only with an extra click. As both Business Insider&#8217;s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jezebel-and-gawkers-porn-problem-2014-8?op=1">Caroline Moss</a> and the Lab&#8217;s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/08/jezebel-takes-its-kinja-problems-public-to-fight-the-trolls/">Justin Ellis</a> pointed out, the tension here is between Gawker founder Nick Denton&#8217;s vision of its commenting platform, Kinja, as an open, collaborative, and anonymous environment and the practicalities of allowing that kind of freedom to Gawker users.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed&#8217;s Myles Tanzer <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mylestanzer/gawker-media-staffers-are-still-ambivalent-about-kinja#13kau6w">talked to Gawker staffers</a> who expressed frustration at the disconnect between Denton&#8217;s vision for Kinja and the difficult, time-consuming reality of wading through comments looking for quality material. And PandoDaily&#8217;s Paul Carr <a href="http://pando.com/2014/08/12/gawker-blocks-all-images-to-protect-staff-from-abuse-now-what-about-everyone-else/">pointed out the inconsistency</a> between its handling of abusive content that affects its staffers and the content it posts about others.</p>

<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: A few other stories and discussions that have emerged in the busy last couple of weeks:</p>
<p>— After making a bid for Time Warner earlier this summer, Rupert Murdoch <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/06/media/fox-earnings/index.html?iid=SF_MED_River">announced</a> his entertainment media company 21st Century Fox was walking away from negotiations with Time Warner, which had been taking a hard line and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/business/media/time-warner-and-fox-negotiations.html?_r=0">refusing to negotiate</a>. As CNN&#8217;s Brian Stelter <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/07/media/what-next-for-time-warner/index.html">reported</a>, media watchers still see the deal as in play eventually, even if it&#8217;s no longer seen as inevitable. The Guardian&#8217;s Heidi Moore <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/06/break-ups-bids-big-media-moguls-rupert-murdoch">wondered</a> whether we&#8217;re seeing the decline of the great media moguls, without anyone to take their place. Meanwhile, News Corp&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/08/news-corp-full-year-profits-halved-as-australian-newspaper-revenue-drops">profits dropped</a>, but Murdoch <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/08/8550394/news-corp-holds-firm-value-print">continued to express his bullishness</a> on print.</p>
<p>— The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/08/07/the-executive-editor-on-the-word-torture/">announced</a> that it would now refer to torture by that name, rather than the term &#8220;harsh&#8221; or &#8220;brutal&#8221; interrogation techniques. The Freedom of the Press Foundation&#8217;s Barry Eisler <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/08/torture-new-york-times-gets-right-result-wrong-reasons">criticized the paper&#8217;s reasoning</a> for finally using the term, and journalism professor Dan Gillmor <a href="http://dangillmor.com/2014/08/08/on-torture-new-york-times-tells-only-part-of-the-truth/">called for The Times to apologize</a> for referring to it incorrectly for years. NYU&#8217;s Jay Rosen <a href="http://pressthink.org/2014/08/wrong-side-of-the-orwell-mister-editor-the-new-york-times-falls-down-on-the-word-torture/">analyzed the factors</a> behind The Times&#8217; refusal to use the term for so long and its change of mind.</p>
<p>— In the ongoing battle between Amazon and the book publisher Hachette, more than 900 writers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/business/media/plot-thickens-as-900-writers-battle-amazon.html?_r=0">paid for ad in The New York Times</a> siding with Hachette and urging readers to complain to Amazon. Amazon <a href="http://www.readersunited.com/">responded with a letter to readers of its own</a>, urging them instead to complain to Hachette. TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/getting-orwell-wrong/">John Biggs</a> and The Times&#8217; <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/orwell-is-amazons-latest-target-in-battle-against-hachette/">David Streitfeld</a> criticized Amazon for its misuse of a quote from George Orwell, and writers John Scalzi (<a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/08/09/amazon-gets-increasingly-nervous/">two</a> <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/08/10/a-brief-list-of-standard-answers-for-the-amazonhachette-thing/">posts</a>), <a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2014/08/09/in-which-amazon-calls-you-to-defend-the-realm/">Chuck Wendig</a>, and <a href="http://matt-wallace.com/?p=326">Matt Wallace</a> picked apart Amazon&#8217;s argument. Writer <a href="https://www.eviscerati.org/articles/2014/08/Amazon-v-Hatchette-Everyone-Wrong-Me">Christopher Wright</a> and Slashgear&#8217;s <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/amazon-hachette-collateral-damage-and-you-09340506/">Nate Swanner</a> gave more &#8220;a pox on both their houses&#8221; analysis.</p>
<p>— Two potentially useful posts: The American Press Institute&#8217;s Kevin Loker on the <a href="http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/strategy-studies/events-revenue/">best strategies</a> for using events to generate revenue for news organizations, and journalism professor Dan Kennedy with a guide to <a href="https://medium.com/@<a href="http://twitter.com/dankennedy_nu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="View dankennedy_nu's Twitter Profile">dankennedy_nu</a>/blog-like-a-journalist-8a4acac100c0">blogging like a journalist</a>.</p>
<p>— Finally, two thought-provoking pieces: Mat Honan of Wired on <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/i-liked-everything-i-saw-on-facebook-for-two-days-heres-what-it-did-to-me/">what happened when he liked everything on Facebook</a> for two days, and Ethan Zuckerman in The Atlantic on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/?single_page=true">the ad-based model</a> as the Internet&#8217;s original sin (along with <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2014/08/14/dystopia-com/">Jeff Jarvis&#8217; response</a>).</p>

<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The key reads this week are <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/buzzfeed-benny-johnson-plagiarism-109444.html">Dylan Byers&#8217; piece</a> on the possible connection between BuzzFeed&#8217;s web-based curation style and the risk of plagiarism and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/business/media/at-front-lines-bearing-witness-in-real-time.html">David Carr&#8217;s piece</a> on war coverage and bearing witness in real time.</p>
<p><strong>Covering war in a social media environment</strong>: Much of the news over the past few weeks has taken place in war zones (or near-war zones) with action quickly moving from one crisis to the next. That&#8217;s put the journalists covering those stories in some particularly dangerous situations: In Ukraine, journalists have been intimidated, detained, and attacked in alarming numbers over the past month, as The Guardian&#8217;s Roy Greenslade <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/23/journalist-safety-ukraine">cataloged</a>. The Committee to Protect Journalists <a href="http://cpj.org/2014/07/journalists-missing-fixer-kidnapped-press-banned-i.php">condemned</a> the abductions and detentions, which are &#8220;happening at dizzying speed in eastern Ukraine.&#8221; One of those involved a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/24/world/europe/ukraine-cnn-fixer-abducted/index.html">Ukrainian freelancer working for CNN</a>, who was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-cnn-freelancer-freed/index.html">freed several days later</a>.</p>
<p>In Gaza, several journalists were <a href="http://cpj.org/2014/07/at-least-three-journalists-injured-by-israeli-airs.php">injured in Israeli airstrikes</a>, and one radio station was forced to shut down because its broadcasting equipment was damaged. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/gunshots-fired-at-al-jazeera-bureau-gaza-2014722829152765.html">Gunshots were fired</a> into Al Jazeera&#8217;s Gaza bureau, a day after Israeli&#8217;s foreign minister reportedly said he would work to shut down Al Jazeera&#8217;s operations in Israel. And in Iran — though not a war zone — a Washington Post correspondent was arrested and detained <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-confirms-arrest-of-post-correspondent/2014/07/25/54fdbc9c-13f6-11e4-8936-26932bcfd6ed_story.html">without explanation</a>, prompting the Obama administration to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/senior-official-calls-for-release-of-post-reporter-in-iran/2014/07/29/47e398e4-173c-11e4-85b6-c1451e622637_story.html">call for his release</a>.</p>
<p>For many news consumers, the bloodshed and mayhem of war has been communicated primarily through social media, with videos, photos, and eyewitness accounts coming from reporters and citizens alike. The New York Times&#8217; David Carr <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/business/media/at-front-lines-bearing-witness-in-real-time.html">reflected</a> on the nature of bearing of witness to war in a real-time environment, writing that <strong>&#8220;Bearing witness is the oldest and perhaps most valuable tool in the journalist’s arsenal, but it becomes something different delivered in the crucible of real time, without pause for reflection.&#8221;</strong> The Times also <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/22/not-the-time-for-antiseptic-coverage-dean-baquet-on-covering-violence-abroad/">defended its decisions</a> to run graphic photos of the violence in Gaza and Ukraine, with executive editor Dean Baquet saying, &#8220;This is not the time for antiseptic coverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The immediate dissemination of news from unstable and uncertain war zones through social media has made verification a particular challenge. The Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/27/mh17-storyful-social-media-twitter-youtube">explored the tactics Storyful used</a> to confirm information shared online, and PBS MediaShift&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2014/07/goodwhen-good-people-share-bad-things-the-basics-of-social-media-verification">Julie Posetti</a> and the Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cjr.org/news_literacy/verifying_ugc.php?page=all">Jihii Jolly</a> both laid out of the basics of the quickly developing discipline of social verification, and Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/18/want-to-help-fact-check-breaking-news-like-the-malaysian-airplane-disaster-heres-how-and-where-you-can-do-it/">outlined some of the most helpful tools</a> for quickly checking out online information.</p>
<p>The real-time reporting of war and the more personal nature of social media have also given rise to new controversies, with two reporters being pulled from Gaza for controversial social media posts. NBC&#8217;s Ayman Mohyeldin was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/17/nbc-news-ayman-mohyeldin-gaza_n_5596268.html">pulled from Gaza</a> then <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamberger/anger-after-nbc-pulls-award-winning-journalist-from-gaza">briefly reinstated</a> after he witnessed Palestinian boys being killed by Israeli shells, and CNN&#8217;s Brian Stelter <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/20/media/ayman-mohyeldin-nbc-news/">reported</a> that he was removed after NBC gave the script he wrote about the incident to another reporter to read. CNN had its own correspondent, Diana Magnay, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/18/cnn-diana-magnay-israel-gaza_n_5598866.html?1405690372">removed from covering the conflict</a> after she referred to Israelis cheering missile strikes as &#8220;scum&#8221; on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism and the ethics of writing online</strong>: Two news organizations dealt with plagiarism cases this week: In the more serious case, BuzzFeed viral politics editor Benny Johnson was fired after he was <a href="http://gawker.com/buzzfeed-has-fired-benny-johnson-for-widespread-plagiar-1611269882">caught plagiarizing from dozens of sources</a>, BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/editors-note-an-apology-to-our-readers">apologized to readers</a> and cataloged the 41 instances of plagiarism that BuzzFeed discovered.</p>
<p>Talking Points Memo&#8217;s Tom Kludt <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/crushingbort-blippoblappo-interview-benny-johnson-buzzfeed">talked to the pseudonymous Twitter users</a> who initially exposed Johnson&#8217;s plagiarism (after Johnson had called out another writer for plagiarizing him), and Digiday&#8217;s Ricardo Bilton <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/buzzfeed-plagiarism-ad-buyers/">talked to ad buyers</a> who weren&#8217;t concerned about the incident&#8217;s impact on BuzzFeed — &#8220;We expect that,&#8221; said one. &#8220;That&#8217;s the medium.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other case involved The New York Times&#8217; Carol Vogel, who was <a href="http://gawker.com/new-york-times-reporter-lifted-text-from-wikipedia-too-1612702486">caught lifting some text from Wikipedia</a> in an article last week. The Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/business/media/times-issues-editors-note-in-response-to-plagiarism-charge.html">added an editor&#8217;s note</a> to the article and &#8220;dealt with&#8221; Vogel in some unspecified way.</p>
<p>The two cases sparked a debate as to how serious plagiarism in these contexts. The Washington Post&#8217;s Gene Weingarten <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/07/29/gene-weingarten-when-plagiarism-is-merely-petty-bull-poo/">pooh-poohed the Johnson case</a>, arguing that his was simply &#8220;crappy, lazy Internet writing&#8221; rather than &#8220;real plagiarism,&#8221; because he lifted things that were of negligible value to produce content that was of negligible value.</p>
<p>New York&#8217;s Joe Coscarelli <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/new-york-times-buzzfeed-wikipedia-plagiarism.html">countered</a> that Weingarten&#8217;s argument was less about the propriety of copying than &#8220;an outdated rant against the state of internet writing in general.&#8221; The Times&#8217; public editor, Margaret Sullivan, <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/carol-vogel-plagiarism-investigation/">stated simply</a> that whether you&#8217;re at BuzzFeed or The Times, the rules are the same: Use your own stuff, or attribute and link. Reuters&#8217; Jack Shafer said <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/2014/07/29/plagiarists-real-crime-ripping-off-readers/">Weingarten is focused too narrowly</a> on plagiarism&#8217;s violation against the creator of the content being copied, when it&#8217;s a much greater crime against readers, &#8220;who have every right to believe that journalists vouch for the copy they serve,&#8221; whether it&#8217;s a listicle or something more substantial.</p>
<p>The Washington Post&#8217;s Erik Wemple <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/07/27/the-ravages-of-buzzfeeds-benny-johnson">went deeper into Johnson&#8217;s plagiarism</a> at BuzzFeed, looking at the sources he borrowed from and how the scandal might influence BuzzFeed. Politico&#8217;s Dylan Byers <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/buzzfeed-benny-johnson-plagiarism-109444.html">posited the idea</a> that outfits like BuzzFeed, which are built around collecting and pithily displaying content from around the web, are more susceptible to bouts of plagiarism than traditional news organizations. <strong>&#8220;If the BuzzFeed case feels different, it is because the site’s very business model — Internet &#8216;curation&#8217; — walks a fine line between aggregation and plagiarism,&#8221;</strong> he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parsing The Times&#8217; numbers</strong>: The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/business/despite-circulation-gains-profit-falls-21-at-new-york-times-co.html">released its quarterly financial numbers this week</a>, and the news was mostly negative: Its revenue and profits both dropped. It did pick up 32,000 new digital subscribers, but as Poynter&#8217;s Rick Edmonds <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/business-news/the-biz-blog/260596/nyts-new-digital-apps-and-subscriptions-are-off-to-a-bumpy-start/">reported</a>, its new paid-content offerings — led by the NYT Now and NYT Opinion apps — haven&#8217;t done as well as expected, serving to confuse some readers and cannibalize subscribers to its existing plans.</p>
<p>At the Lab, Ken Doctor <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/a-stormy-set-of-revenue-numbers-for-the-new-york-times-and-the-broader-news-industry/">saw the slow uptake of NYT Now</a> as a cautionary lesson for other news organizations hoping to gain subscription revenue from new digital products. The Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Ryan Chittum <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/the_nyts_new_paywall_products.php">contrasted The Times&#8217; mediocre figures</a> with the Financial Times&#8217; steady growth and suggested that The Times start tweaking its core subscriptions rather than adding new options as revenue drivers. And The Atlantic&#8217;s Derek Thompson <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/the-new-york-times-is-a-great-company-in-a-terrible-business/375240/">noted</a> that despite its strong efforts to boost circulation, it just can&#8217;t solve the digital advertising problem that plagues its industry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Capital New York&#8217;s Joe Pompeo <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/07/8549875/shorter-emtimesem">reported</a>, based on a reader survey that was recently sent out, that The Times is considering another subscription option, this one in print: A condensed print edition that would be about half the price of the current paper.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluating Fox&#8217;s bid for Time Warner</strong>: Since news of 21st Century Fox&#8217;s bid for Time Warner was reported a few weeks ago, little has occurred publicly on that front. But as The New York Times&#8217; David Carr and Business Insider&#8217;s Henry Blodget <a href="http://reliablesources.blogs.cnn.com/2014/07/20/david-carr-henry-blodget-on-rupert-murdochs-bid-for-time-warner/">told CNN</a>, the question of Fox acquiring Time Warner quickly shifted from &#8216;whether&#8217; to &#8216;when&#8217; and &#8216;how much.&#8217; Blodget <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/murdoch-raise-time-warner-bid-2014-7?op=1">reported</a> that Fox will take its time in raising its bid and that Time Warner shareholders expect the deal to happen once they can get the price bumped up sufficiently. On the other hand, Time Warner <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/time-warner-cancels-shareholders-ability-to-call-special-board-meeting/?smid=tw-dealbook&amp;seid=auto">amended its bylaws</a> to remove shareholders&#8217; ability to call a special meeting, buying itself some time against a sale forced by shareholders.</p>
<p>The New York Times&#8217; Richard Sandomir <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/business/media/fox-challenges-espn-with-pursuit-of-time-warner.html">looked at the challenge</a> a Fox-Time Warner acquisition would present for ESPN, with the addition of TBS, TNT, and Bleacher Report to Fox&#8217;s portfolio. Journalism professor Dan Kennedy said Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s Fox <a href="http://wgbhnews.org/post/why-rupert-murdoch-could-prove-be-savior-cnn">could save Time Warner&#8217;s CNN</a> by having it sold to a new owner who would overhaul the lackluster network, while The Guardian&#8217;s Roy Greenslade <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/24/rupert-murdoch-time-warner">argued</a> that the decline in competition from deals such as this one would be bad news for viewers.</p>
<p>At The Times, Carr <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/business/media/riding-the-juggernaut-that-left-print-behind.html">noticed</a> that there was one thing conspicuously absent from this rumored merger and the future of media these companies are trying to form: Print. <strong>&#8220;To the extent that the proposal offered a crystal ball on the future of media, print doesn’t seem as if it will be much a part of it.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: There were a number of smaller media happenings over the past couple of weeks — here are a few to keep an eye on:</p>
<p>— Forbes Media, which had been owned since its founding in 1917 by the Forbes family, <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/forbes-media-to-sell-majority-stake-to-hong-kong-investors/">sold a majority stake</a> to the Hong Kong investment company Integrated Whale Media Investments, which valued the company at a reported $475 million. Former owner <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2014/07/18/the-next-frontier-for-forbes/">Steve Forbes</a> and executive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2014/07/21/inside-forbes-after-our-sale-what-it-means-and-where-were-headed/">Lewis DVorkin</a> talked about what&#8217;s next for the company, and both the Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/is_forbes_worth_475_million.php?page=all">Ryan Chittum</a> and journalism professor <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2014/07/18/silver-bullets/">Jeff Jarvis</a> wondered what Forbes&#8217; click-driven editorial strategy has cost the company in quality and credibility.</p>
<p>— First Look Media, the news venture founded last year by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, announced a shift this week in a <a href="https://firstlook.org/2014/07/28/update/">blog post by Omidyar</a>. Instead of building a family of &#8220;digital magazines&#8221; as it had initially intended, it will focus on the two it&#8217;s already launched — one built around Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s work and another around Matt Taibbi&#8217;s — while planning on doubling its staff to 50 and centering its work on more tech-based experimentation with news. Jay Rosen, a consultant to First Look, <a href="http://pressthink.org/2014/07/first-look-media-shifts-direction-some/">offered his interpretation</a> of the announcement, as did the Lab&#8217;s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/first-look-media-changes-course-on-digital-magazines/">Justin Ellis</a> and Gigaom&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/28/first-look-media-revises-its-focus-wants-to-be-more-of-a-journalism-lab-than-a-standalone-news-site/">Mathew Ingram</a>.</p>
<p>— The Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/17/coming-soon-storyline/">announced</a> that it will launch Storyline, a sister site to Wonkblog, which had been piloted by Ezra Klein, who&#8217;s since departed to found Vox. The Huffington Post&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/22/washington-post-storyline_n_5607342.html">Michael Calderone</a> and Poynter&#8217;s <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/259865/heres-the-storyline-behind-the-washington-posts-storyline/">Benjamin Mullin</a> both gave some details about The Post&#8217;s plans: It will center on policy issues, and will be data-driven and topic-oriented.</p>
<p>— The New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/28/note-readers">relaunched its website</a> last week, a move that includes the addition of a metered paywall. The Guardian&#8217;s Hannah Jane Parkinson <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jul/22/new-yorker-website-redesign-magazine-archives">went through the redesign</a>, and Capital New York&#8217;s Nicole Levy and Peter Sterne <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/07/8549298/relaunch-emthe-new-yorkerem-high-stakes">went deep</a> into what&#8217;s at stake with the overhaul.</p>
<p>— E. W. Scripps and Journal Communications <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/news31-b99321641z1-269303021.html">announced a deal</a> in which they will merge their broadcast operations and spin off their newspapers into a separate company. Here at the Lab, Joshua Benton <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/diversified-media-companies-are-hurrying-to-undiversify/">explained</a> how the move marks a trend of media companies looking to narrow their portfolios after years of talk of diversification.</p>

<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The key pieces to read this week are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/business/media/in-modern-media-realm-big-mergers-are-a-bulwark-against-rivals.html">David Carr</a> and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/the-newsonomics-of-the-new-quest-for-big-big-big/">Ken Doctor</a> on what&#8217;s behind the push for big media mergers, <a href="https://medium.com/makers-perspective/you-gotta-read-this-59e07bdf9cd1">John Borthwick</a> on clickbait, sharing, and attention, and <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/259122/essay-hey-publishers-stop-fooling-us-and-yourselves/">David Boardman&#8217;s warning</a> to newspaper executives.</p>
<p><strong>Murdoch&#8217;s play for Time Warner</strong>: Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s latest in a long history of big media takeover bids was revealed this when The New York Times <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/rupert-murdoch-said-to-have-made-offer-for-time-warner/">reported</a> that his 21st Century Fox made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner that was rejected last month. 21st Century Fox, the entertainment media properties of the former News Corp (Murdoch&#8217;s news properties now make up News Corp), would be buying an entertainment company that includes Warner Bros. movies, Turner, and HBO, now shorn of its cable/broadband business and publishing business (which have split off as Time Warner Cable and Time Inc., respectively).</p>
<p>Mashable&#8217;s <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/16/rupert-murdoch-big-hbo-fan/">Andy Fixmer</a>, Quartz&#8217;s <a href="http://qz.com/235746/its-not-tv-that-rupert-murdoch-wants-its-hbo/">John McDuling</a>, and Bloomberg&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-16/hbo-said-valued-at-20-billion-by-fox-seeking-netflix-killer.html">Erik Schatzker and Caitlin McCabe</a> all said HBO is at the center of Fox&#8217;s pursuit of Time Warner; it would give Fox one of the world&#8217;s premier content properties and, through HBO Go, a major tool to compete with Netflix in the growing streaming video market. Bloomberg said Fox values HBO at $20 billion — a quarter of its total offer for Time Warner. Business Insider&#8217;s Jay Yarow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-rupert-murdoch-offered-to-buy-time-warner-2014-7">argued</a> that Fox&#8217;s interest is a bit broader: It wants to gobble up as many valuable TV properties as it can to improve its leverage with TV distributors.</p>
<p>Slate&#8217;s Jordan Weissmann said the deal <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/16/_21st_century_fox_time_warner_merger_offer_murdoch_is_going_hunting.html">may be as simple</a> as Fox digging deeper into a still very profitable business (TV), and asserted that if Murdoch wants Time Warner, he&#8217;ll eventually get it. Ad Age&#8217;s Simon Dumenco <a href="http://adage.com/article/media/rupert-murdoch-unstoppable-immortal/294144/">also made that point</a>, declaring Murdoch &#8220;untouchable and unstoppable.&#8221; USA Today&#8217;s Rem Rieder <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2014/07/16/the-amazing-resilience-of-rupert-murdoch/12730313/">marveled</a> at how Murdoch is bouncing back from News Corp&#8217;s phone-hacking scandal. Still, Business Insider&#8217;s Hunter Walker <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/experts-regulators-will-watch-rupert-murdochs-time-warner-deal-2014-7?op=1">noted</a> that antitrust regulators could stand in the way of a potential deal, and The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Keach Hagey <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/21st-century-fox-bid-puts-cnn-in-cross-hairs-1405550201-lMyQjAxMTA0MDEwNjExNDYyWj">looked at what a sale might mean</a> for the Time Warner property CNN, which would be left out of the deal as an antitrust concession.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s to Fox or to someone else, Peter Lauria of BuzzFeed argued that <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/peterlauria/why-time-warner-will-sell-to-someone">Time Warner will sell eventually</a>, since it likely represents the best value for its shareholders at this point. Capital New York&#8217;s Alex Weprin <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/07/8549045/what-other-companies-could-make-credible-play-time-warner">broke down</a> several of the other potential buyers, and Peter Kafka of Recode said <a href="http://recode.net/2014/07/16/whos-going-to-buy-time-warner-someone-who-loves-cable-tv/">it will be bought</a> by a company that wants to make a big bet on the pay TV business. The New York Times&#8217; Jonathan Mahler and Emily Steel <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/business/media/foxs-bid-was-made-possible-by-time-warner-chiefs-revival-program.html">analyzed the turnaround</a> at Time Warner that&#8217;s made the company so attractive.</p>
<p>The New York Times&#8217; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/business/media/in-modern-media-realm-big-mergers-are-a-bulwark-against-rivals.html">David Carr</a> and the Lab&#8217;s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/the-newsonomics-of-the-new-quest-for-big-big-big/">Ken Doctor</a> both explained the climate of ever-bigger mergers and consolidations that has begun to swirl again around the media industry. They pointed to a couple of major rationales for these defensive moves — size yields negotiating power, and if you can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em, buy &#8217;em — and noted that regulators don&#8217;t seem to be a big obstacle: <strong>&#8220;For the most part, the current government has passed on regulating potential monopolies, and as citizens, we have become inured to the consequences of bigness,&#8221;</strong> Carr wrote.</p>
<p>Finally, USA Today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/07/16/ginsberg-key-to-murdoch-pursuit-of-time-warner/12728435/">Michael Wolff</a> and Financial Review&#8217;s <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/business/companies/time_fox_deal_will_show_the_true_AjQJNmGRLNU1RvSHZhgqGL">Neil Chenoweth</a> looked at two behind-the-scenes players on each side who are helping engineer this possible deal: Time Warner&#8217;s Gary Ginsberg, in Wolff&#8217;s piece, and Fox&#8217;s Chase Carey, in Chenoweth&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Going beyond clickbait and its backlash</strong>: &#8220;Clickbait&#8221; has been one of this summer&#8217;s ongoing topics of discussion in the media world, and The Daily Beast&#8217;s Emily Shire <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/14/saving-us-from-ourselves-the-anti-clickbait-movement.html">examined</a> the anti-clickbait movement — exemplified by The Onion&#8217;s <a href="http://www.clickhole.com/">Clickhole</a> and Twitter accounts like <a href="https://twitter.com/SavedYouAClick">@<a href="http://twitter.com/SavedYouAClick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="View SavedYouAClick's Twitter Profile">SavedYouAClick</a></a> — as evidence that people are getting wise to the premise of duping and manipulating readers through unnecessarily coy headlines. Vox&#8217;s Nilay Patel said clickbait headlines still work (most of the time) because <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5901977/can-you-answer-these-four-questions-and-save-the-media-from-taylor-swift">they&#8217;re essentially games</a> for the reader to play, and Poynter&#8217;s Andrew Beaujon <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/258985/the-real-problem-with-clickbait/">posited</a> that the main problem with clickbait is not the headlines, but the disappointing content that goes with them. &#8220;And yet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the blame often falls more heavily on marketing than the people churning out stuff that sucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Betaworks CEO John Borthwick <a href="https://medium.com/makers-perspective/you-gotta-read-this-59e07bdf9cd1">provided some data</a> on the connection between attention and sharing that&#8217;s the foundation of most clickbait&#8217;s popularity, and found that there are many readers who spend very little time on pages after clicking but share the article anyway, sharing essentially based on the headline alone. But beyond those headline-sharers and the people who read on and are disappointed with the content, there are also a significant number of people who spend substantial time reading an article and are also quite likely to share it. Borthwick urged publishers to spend more time attracting those kinds of readers, and Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/16/the-news-about-reader-attention-and-the-evolution-of-media-isnt-all-bad-theres-the-hill-of-wow/">described Borthwick&#8217;s findings</a> as two versions of the online world: One noisy, fast and click-driven; and the other deeper, slower, less noticeable, but still widely read and shared.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent sites built around the former model, Upworthy, <a href="http://blog.upworthy.com/post/91319489171/look-ma-upworthy-is-an-actual-business-now">reported late last week</a> that by far their most viewed, shared, and closely read pieces are not their own editorial content, but their native ads. At Contently, Joe Lazauskas <a href="http://contently.com/strategist/2014/07/15/upworthys-sponsored-posts-are-crushing-their-regular-editorial-heres-why/">gave a few reasons</a> for Upworthy&#8217;s remarkable success with native ads: It likely pays to relentlessly promote those ads on social networks, and the type of blandly feel-good content that makes for the best ads is exactly the same type of content Upworthy&#8217;s already producing in its editorial content.</p>

<p><strong>Was SI scooping or suckered?</strong>: Sports Illustrated scored the biggest breaking sports news story of the year last Friday when it ran a <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers">first-person piece</a> by NBA star LeBron James revealing that he would re-sign with his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. The essay was written as an as-told-to piece with veteran SI journalist Lee Jenkins. <a href="http://deadspin.com/how-cleveland-and-sports-illustrated-won-the-lebron-jam-1603763328/">Deadspin</a>, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/07/11/how-si-com-got-the-big-lebron-scoop-and-how-its-traffic-soared/">The Wall Street Journal</a> and the <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2014/07/how_sis_lee_jenkins_got_the_bi.html">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a> all provided some details about how the story came about: Jenkins got wind of James&#8217; decision on Thursday, pitched a first-person piece to his editors at SI, interviewed James and wrote the piece Thursday night, and handed it off to his editors on Friday. Deadspin reported that the idea for a first-person essay was first proposed by James&#8217; camp, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/sports/basketball/role-of-sports-illustrated-in-lebron-jamess-announcement-raises-journalistic-questions.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a> reported that it came from Jenkins.</p>
<p>The Times&#8217; Richard Sandomir <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/12/sports/basketball/role-of-sports-illustrated-in-lebron-jamess-announcement-raises-journalistic-questions.html?_r=0">criticized SI&#8217;s strategy</a>, saying the magazine gave up an opportunity to put some journalistic weight behind a big story. Said Sandomir: &#8220;the approach cast Sports Illustrated more as a public-relations ally of James than as the strong journalistic standard-bearer it has been for decades.&#8221; In an online chat, The Washington Post&#8217;s Gene Weingarten <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/258756/si-takes-heat-for-lebron-to-cavs-scoop/">echoed the point</a>, calling it an example of a journalistic mindset in which &#8220;being first is overvalued and being good is too often beside the point, or financially imprudent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craig Calcaterra of NBC Sports <a href="http://craigcalcaterra.tumblr.com/post/91542310207/sports-illustrated-gets-modern-media-gets-criticized">questioned</a> what exactly Sandomir was expecting SI to add to the story, characterizing it as commodity news as opposed to a substantial story crying out for in-depth reporting. Sandomir, he said, is <strong>&#8220;fetishizing the business of <em>Serious Journalism</em> at the expense of understanding what sports fans actually care about, appreciating how informed sports fans already are and asserting that the reporter’s highest and best function is to get between fans and the news as opposed to delivering it to them.&#8221;</strong> Poynter&#8217;s Sam Kirkland said <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/258756/si-takes-heat-for-lebron-to-cavs-scoop/">it&#8217;s still possible</a> for SI to break the story this way and do deeper journalism on it as well. (Jenkins was in Cleveland this week reporting a feature on James&#8217; decision.) And Deadspin&#8217;s Kevin Draper <a href="http://deadspin.com/who-actually-got-the-lebron-james-scoop-1604853768">looked at the other reporters</a> who scrambled to get this scoop.</p>

<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: A few other pieces to read from this week:</p>
<p>— Industry analyst Alan Mutter <a href="http://newsosaur.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-newspaper-crisis-by-numbers.html">pulled together some simple numbers</a> to remind us just how dire the newspaper industry&#8217;s situation is, and Temple University&#8217;s David Boardman <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/259122/essay-hey-publishers-stop-fooling-us-and-yourselves/">criticized the Newspaper Association of America&#8217;s Carolyn Little&#8217;s rosy speech</a> and instead urged newspapers to drop to one day a week in print. Little <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/259276/newspaper-group-ceo-we-need-to-embrace-all-media-including-print/">issued a defense</a> of her picture of the industry.</p>
<p>— The U.S. Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s public comment period on its proposed &#8220;fast lane&#8221; plans for Internet providers was supposed to end on Tuesday, but it was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/15/fcc-extends-deadline-user-comments-net-neutrality">postponed until today</a> because a surge of comments from net neutrality supporters overwhelmed its system. The Washington Post&#8217;s Brian Fung <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/07/15/todays-the-biggest-day-for-net-neutrality-in-months-heres-whats-at-stake/">explained</a> the proposal and backlash, and at The Guardian, Dan Gillmor <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/16/fcc-net-neutrality-open-internet-big-telecom">urged net neutrality advocates</a> to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>— Capital New York&#8217;s Joe Pompeo <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/07/8548700/jim-bradys-philly-gamble-third-times-charm">profiled</a> the new Philadelphia-based online local journalism initiative by Washington Post/TBD/Digital First veteran Jim Brady, Brother.ly, and Brady <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/259052/brady-local-coverage-should-involve-communities-and-help-them-improve/#.U8e1VtWRxKs.twitter">talked with Poynter&#8217;s Butch Ward</a> about what he&#8217;s learned about local news.</p>
<p>— Finally, Nebraska professor Matt Waite <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/true-facts-maybe/">wrote a thoughtful and important piece</a> on the value of doubt in data journalism, with some ideas on how to better incorporate it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[This review was originally posted at the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/this-week-in-review-facebook-and-online-control-and-educating-stronger-data-journalists/">Nieman Journalism Lab</a> on July 11, 2014.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The key pieces this week are NYU&#8217;s Jay Rosen (in an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/03/dont-blame-facebook-for-screwing-with-your-mood-blame-academia/">article</a> and an <a href="http://blog.wan-ifra.org/2014/07/10/jay-rosen-to-journalists-and-editors-facebook-has-all-the-power-you-have-almost-none">interview</a>) on Facebook&#8217;s legitimacy and control, journalism professor <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/alberto-cairo-data-journalism-needs-to-up-its-own-standards/">Alberto Cairo</a> on solving data journalism&#8217;s current crisis, and Cornell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/qa-tarleton-gillespie-says-algorithms-may-be-new-but-editorial-calculations-arent/">Tarleton Gillespie</a> on algorithms, journalism, news judgment, and personalization.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook, online research, and control</strong>: A week after <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">Facebook&#8217;s experimental study</a> on News Feed content and user emotions initially prompted an uproar, observers continued to talk about its implications for research, social media, and control. A privacy group <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/privacy-group-complains-to-f-t-c-about-facebook-emotion-study/">filed a complaint</a> with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission late last week, and the journal that published the study <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/07/02/1412469111.full.pdf+html">published a formal</a> &#8220;expression of concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others pushed back against the outrage at Facebook over the study: Microsoft researcher Duncan Watts <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/07/facebook-study-science-experiment-research">argued</a> that our emotions are being manipulated all the time by marketers and politicians and said we should insist that companies like Facebook &#8220;perform and publish research on the effects of the decisions they&#8217;re already making on our behalf.&#8221; Likewise, Forbes&#8217; Jeff Bercovici said Facebook&#8217;s study was <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/06/30/facebooks-experiment-on-emotions-sounds-creepier-than-it-was/">much more innocuous</a> than it&#8217;s being made out to be.</p>
<p>Former Facebook data scientist Andrew Ledvina <a href="http://andrewledvina.com/code/2014/07/04/10-ways-facebook-is-the-devil.html">questioned</a> why there was so much outrage about this particular study when Facebook conducts constant experiments on user behavior. The only change Ledvina saw emerging from this episode was not that Facebook would stop doing these types of experiments, but that it would stop making them public. Similarly, Microsoft&#8217;s Andrés Monroy-Hernández said the incendiary tone of the discussion surrounding this study <a href="http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/07/07/a-system-designers-take-to-the-facebook-study-a-response-to-danah-boyd-reaction/">makes him more reluctant</a> to share his own research publicly.</p>
<p>Blogger and developer Dave Winer this incident <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/07/04/aboutFacebookUsersAndFacebook.html">damages Facebook</a> by destroying its users&#8217; illusion of an organically generated News Feed: &#8220;Facebook just broke the fourth wall. Of a sudden we see the man behind the curtain. And it&#8217;s ugly and arrogant and condescending and all around not a nice feeling.&#8221; On the other hand, Gigaom&#8217;s Tom Krazit said most users <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/06/why-you-can-no-longer-expect-that-the-news-will-find-you/">already knew that Facebook manipulates their News Feed</a>, but we don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re doing it, so we can no longer consider it a useful source of news.</p>
<p>NYU&#8217;s Jay Rosen <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/03/dont-blame-facebook-for-screwing-with-your-mood-blame-academia/">argued late last week</a> that Facebook has a very &#8220;thin&#8221; form of legitimacy for its experiments because of its lack of attunement to ethical concerns, and in an <a href="http://blog.wan-ifra.org/2014/07/10/jay-rosen-to-journalists-and-editors-facebook-has-all-the-power-you-have-almost-none">interview this week</a>, he warned that Facebook needs to be careful not to derive false confidence from its dominance of the social media market. <strong>&#8220;&#8216;W</strong><span style="color: #<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23222222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Search Twitter for &quot;222222&quot;">222222</a>;"><strong>here else are they going to go?&#8221; is a long way from trust and loyalty. It is less a durable business model than a statement of power,&#8221;</strong> he wrote.</span></p>
<p>From a bigger-picture viewpoint, Stanford professor Michael Bernstein said <a href="https://medium.com/@<a href="http://twitter.com/msbernst" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="View msbernst's Twitter Profile">msbernst</a>/9155cdff659">researchers need to rethink</a> how they apply the principle of informed consent to online environment, and Gigaom founder Om Malik <a href="http://om.co/2014/07/08/with-big-data-comes-big-responsibility/">looked at the responsibility</a> that needs to come with the unprecedented level of data and automation that&#8217;s involved in modern life.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Improving data journalism with education</strong>: A couple of conversations this week converged on two important issues facing the news industry: data journalism and journalism education. Miami journalism professor Alberto Cairo <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/alberto-cairo-data-journalism-needs-to-up-its-own-standards/">diagnosed the underwhelming output</a> at some of the prominent new data-oriented journalism sites, concluding that <strong>&#8220;Even if data journalism is by no means a new phenomenon, it has entered the mainstream quite recently, breezed over the peak of inflated expectations, and precipitously sank into a valley of gloom.&#8221;</strong> Cairo made a set of prescriptions for data journalism, including devoting more time, resources, and careful critical thinking to it. At Gigaom, Derrick Harris <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/07/09/data-journalism-could-use-a-jolt-of-data-science-too/">added that data journalism could use more influence from data science</a>, especially in finding and developing new datasets. And sociology professor Zeynep Tufekci <a href="https://medium.com/message/learning-from-natesilver538s-omg-wrong-bra-vs-ger-prediction-9d47fa0611e">used this week&#8217;s World Cup shocker</a> to look at flaws in statistical prediction models.</p>
<p>In a weeklong series, PBS MediaShift took a deeper look at what journalism schools are doing to meet the growing demand for skilled, critically thinking data journalists. The series included an <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2014/07/6-questions-for-the-tow-centers-alex-howard-on-data-journalism/">interview on the state of data journalism</a> with Alex Howard of Columbia&#8217;s Tow Center, tips from The Upshot&#8217;s Derek Willis on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2014/07/take-an-interviewing-approach-to-find-stories-in-data/">&#8220;interviewing&#8221; data</a> to understand it and find its stories, a look at <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2014/07/how-j-schools-are-tackling-the-demand-for-data-journalism-skills/">how journalism schools are teaching data journalism</a>, and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2014/07/7-ways-to-incorporate-data-journalism-into-your-classes/">practical suggestions</a> of ways to incorporate data into journalism education.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in journalism education, the American Journalism Review&#8217;s Michael King <a href="http://ajr.org/2014/07/07/journalism-enrollments-fall/">examined enrollment declines</a> at American journalism schools, noting the tricky question of whether these declines are a leading or lagging indicator — something primarily indicative, in other words, of journalism&#8217;s last several years or next several years. And David Ryfe, director of the University of Iowa&#8217;s journalism school <a href="http://www.davidryfe.com/j-school-curricula/">looked at the difficulty</a> of fitting the dozens of skills desired by employers into a relatively small number of journalism courses.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Google raises censorship concerns</strong>: One story on Google and censorship that came to a head late last week: In response to a May ruling by a European court, Google began removing pages from certain European search results per requests filed based on irrelevant or false information. By last week, that began including news articles, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28130581">most notably a BBC column</a> on Merrill Lynch, but also <a href="http://marketingland.com/eu-right-to-be-forgotten-censorship-89783">several other articles</a>. In a pair of helpful posts, The Guardian&#8217;s Charles Arthur <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/what-is-google-deleting-under-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-why">explained the removals in general</a>, and Marketing Land&#8217;s Danny Sullivan <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28130581">explained</a> the removals of news articles.</p>
<p>Google <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/03/us-google-searches-idUSKBN0F82L920140703">reversed its decision</a> to remove several links to Guardian stories as British news organizations <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/03/google-right-to-be-forgotten-law-uk-news-search-requests">criticized Google&#8217;s implementation</a> of the law. Gigaom&#8217;s <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/07/03/the-eus-right-to-be-forgotten-is-a-bad-idea-and-google-is-handling-it-exactly-the-right-way/">Mathew Ingram</a> and The Next Web&#8217;s <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2014/07/04/google-takedown-requests/">Paul Sawers</a> both posited that Google, which opposed the ruling, is enforcing it in deliberately draconian so as to create a controversy about the censorship it entails. But Danny Sullivan <a href="http://searchengineland.com/eu-right-forgotten-mess-google-195813">countered</a> that it&#8217;s highly unlikely that Google is doing this to sabotage the ruling, since the links it&#8217;s removing span much broader than easily outraged media outlets.</p>

<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: A few other bits and pieces going on during this slow week:</p>
<p>— The U.S. National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed another finding on surveillance this week: The Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-nsa-intercepted-data-those-not-targeted-far-outnumber-the-foreigners-who-are/2014/07/05/8139adf8-045a-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html">reported</a> that the number of ordinary American Internet users in communications intercepted by the NSA far outnumber the legally targeted foreigners. The Intercept also <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/07/09/under-surveillance/">reported</a> on several prominent Muslim American academics and activists who were monitored by the NSA. The Intercept&#8217;s Glenn Greenwald <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/greenwald-q-a/">talked to Wired</a> about why the story is important, while PandoDaily&#8217;s Paul Carr <a href="http://pando.com/2014/07/06/why-did-greenwald-agree-to-government-plea-to-hold-major-nsa-story-but-the-post-didnt/">questioned Greenwald&#8217;s hesitation</a> in publishing the story.</p>
<p>— The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/wsj-editor-in-chief-a-letter-to-readers-1404787773">celebrated its 125th anniversary</a> this week with an <a href="http://wsj.com/125/wsj-125-archive/bIssues">archive</a> looking at how they&#8217;ve covered big news events in the past as well as a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/WSJ-125-Anniversary.html">special report</a>. The Lab&#8217;s Joseph Lichterman <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/how-the-wall-street-journal-is-celebrating-its-125th-anniversary-while-also-looking-ahead/">took a closer look</a> at the Journal&#8217;s anniversary offerings, and Capital New York <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/07/8548509/60-second-interview-gerard-baker-emwall-street-journalem-managing-edit?news-image">talked to Journal managing editor Gerard Baker</a>. The Atlantic&#8217;s Adrienne LaFrance, meanwhile, had a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/a-design-lesson-from-the-wall-street-journal/374059/">fascinating look at the Journal&#8217;s design</a> through the years.</p>
<p>— The Pew Research Center <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2014/07/10/coping-with-fewer-reporting-resources/">released a study</a> on the declining number of reporters covering U.S. state legislatures and what&#8217;s being done to fill the gaps. The Lab&#8217;s Joseph Lichterman <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/pew-study-new-media-outlets-attempt-to-fill-void-in-statehouse-coverage-across-the-u-s/">wrote a good summary</a>.</p>
<p>— This week&#8217;s handiest piece: Sarah Marshall&#8217;s <a href="http://sarahmarshall.io/post/90941979203/a-guide-to-advanced-newsgathering-using-tweetdeck">summary</a> of the tips Johanna Geary, head of news at Twitter UK, gave to British journalists about using Tweetdeck as a reporting tool.</p>
<p>— Finally, the Lab&#8217;s Caroline O&#8217;Donovan <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/qa-tarleton-gillespie-says-algorithms-may-be-new-but-editorial-calculations-arent/">talked to Cornell&#8217;s Tarleton Gillespie</a> about a wide range of issues surrounding algorithms, including personalized news, news judgment, and clickbait.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[This review was originally posted at the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/this-week-in-review-questions-on-facebooks-experiment-and-a-knockout-blow-to-aereo/">Nieman Journalism Lab</a> on July 3, 2014.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The key pieces from the past couple of weeks are <a href="http://codingconduct.tumblr.com/post/90242838320/frame-clashes-or-why-the-facebook-emotion-experiment">Sebastian Deterding</a> on the ethics of Facebook&#8217;s experiment, the Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/washington_post_jeff_bezos.php?page=all">Michael Meyer</a> on Jeff Bezos&#8217; plan for The Washington Post, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/25/-sp-phone-hacking-trial-rebekah-brooks-rupert-murdoch">Nick Davies&#8217; sweeping review</a> of News Corp.&#8217;s phone hacking scandal and British tabloid journalism culture.</p>
<p>The review has been off the last two weeks, so this week&#8217;s review covers the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook&#8217;s ethically dubious experiment</strong>: Facebook was under fire again this week for collecting data from its users without their knowledge, this time in conjunction with Cornell University professors for an experiment on the influence of Facebook&#8217;s News Feed on its users&#8217; emotions. The <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/05/29/1320040111.full.pdf">study</a>, which was published in May, involved skewing what nearly 700,000 users saw for a week in their News Feeds with more positive or negative words and then measuring the positivity and negativity in their own posts.</p>
<p>The Atlantic&#8217;s Robinson Meyer has a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">good explanation</a> of the procedural and ethical details behind the study: Cornell&#8217;s institutional review board, which reviews all research the university does involving human subjects, wasn&#8217;t involved until after the experiment was finished. And as Forbes&#8217; Kashmir Hill <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/30/facebook-only-got-permission-to-do-research-on-users-after-emotion-manipulation-study/">reported</a>, the statement in Facebook&#8217;s terms of service that it can use its users&#8217; data for research wasn&#8217;t added until after the study was conducted. It&#8217;s not clear what review the study did get — in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/29/facebook-doesnt-understand-the-fuss-about-its-emotion-manipulation-study/">another Hill article</a>, Facebook said it conducted an &#8220;internal review&#8221; of the study. The Atlantic&#8217;s Adrienne LaFrance also <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/even-the-editor-of-facebooks-mood-study-thought-it-was-creepy/373649/">reported</a> on the misgivings of the study&#8217;s editor as well as her reasons for approving it.</p>
<p>Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-that-facebook-experiment-that-manipulated-your-emotions/">put together a good summary</a> of the criticism and defenses of the study&#8217;s ethics from people within and outside Facebook. British regulators said <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-01/facebook-s-news-feed-experiment-probed-by-u-k-regulators.html">they&#8217;re investigating Facebook</a> on the study, and Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/02/facebooks-sandberg-apologizes-for-news-feed-experiment/">apologized</a> on the company&#8217;s behalf — not for the study itself, but for communicating it poorly. One of the study&#8217;s authors, Facebook data scientist Adam Kramer, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/akramer/posts/10152987150867796">defended the study&#8217;s design</a> while apologizing for &#8220;any anxiety it caused&#8221; and noting that Facebook&#8217;s internal review processes have improved since the study was conducted.</p>
<p>Numerous writers condemned Facebook&#8217;s callousness in running the study, including <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140629/06260027718/facebook-messed-with-emotions-689003-users-science.shtml">Mike Masnick</a> of Techdirt, <a href="http://time.com/2941107/facebook-experiment-ethics/">James Poniewozik</a> of Time, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/do_the_math/2014/06/facebook_study_the_iffy_ethics_of_making_a_huge_number_of_people_very_very.html">Jordan Ellenberg</a> of Slate, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/29/facebook-and-the-ethics-of-user-manipulation/">Alex Wilhelm</a> of Techcrunch. Wired&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-06/30/facebook-manipulating-emotions-study">Katie Collins</a> argued that the study reminds us that &#8220;Facebook as a company trades in information, not people,&#8221; and both <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/30/facebook-emotion-study-another-reason-distrust">Charles Arthur</a> of The Guardian and <a href="http://pando.com/2014/06/28/facebooks-science-experiment-on-users-shows-the-company-is-more-even-powerful-and-unethical-than-we-thought/">David Holmes</a> of PandoDaily warned that the study indicates Facebook&#8217;s immense power and its willingness to use that power for ignoble ends.</p>
<p>Several researchers published defenses of Facebook: The University of Texas&#8217; Tal Yarkoni <a href="http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2014/06/28/in-defense-of-facebook/">argued</a> that concerns about Facebook manipulating its users&#8217; experience are overblown because the News Feed is an entirely artificial environment, the site of constant manipulation. Northeastern&#8217;s Brian Keegan <a href="http://www.brianckeegan.com/2014/06/the-beneficence-of-mobs-a-facebook-apologia/">argued</a> that &#8220;every A/B test is a psych experiment.&#8221; And in a more measured post, Microsoft researcher danah boyd said that <a href="http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/07/01/facebook-experiment/">too much of the criticism</a> has narrowly focused on Facebook because it provided a concrete point on which to focus their anxiety about big data.</p>
<p>Sociologist Zeynep Tufekci <a href="https://medium.com/message/engineering-the-public-289c91390225">pushed back</a> against those defenses, arguing that the concern about manipulation is a legitimate one: <strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>it is clear that the powerful have increasingly more ways to engineer the public,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;That, to me, is a scarier and more important question than whether or not such research gets published.&#8221;</strong> Design researcher Sebastian Deterding had the <a href="http://codingconduct.tumblr.com/post/90242838320/frame-clashes-or-why-the-facebook-emotion-experiment">most thorough ethical breakdown</a> of the study, explaining the clash of opinions as a collision between understandings of the study as academic research and as social media A/B testing. At The Atlantic, Sara Watson said the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/data-science-what-the-facebook-controversy-is-really-about/373770/">controversy centers on the question</a> of whether data science can consider itself a science.</p>
<p>Sociologist Janet Vertesi said this study <a href="http://time.com/2950699/facebook-experiment-social-science-funding/">points up the larger issue</a> of increasing corporate funding of academic research. Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-test-we-canand-shouldrun-on-facebook/373819/">called for future experimental studies</a> to be made opt-in, and at Wired, Evan Selinger and Woodrow Hertzog <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/facebook-partner-in-scheme/">urged the development</a> of a &#8220;People&#8217;s Terms of Service Agreement.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>A big court win for broadcast</strong>: Aereo, a startup that allowed users to pay to stream over-the-air television by renting tiny antennas, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/business/media/supreme-court-rules-against-aereo-in-broadcasters-challenge.html?smid=tw-share">lost its case in the U.S. Supreme Court</a> last week in a big victory for broadcasters. In its majority decision, the court stated that Aereo was not so much an equipment provider (as the company claimed) as a cable system that transmitted copyrighted content. Cable carriers have to pay retransmission fees for the over-the-air networks they broadcast, which Aereo was trying to avoid. Aereo <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/28/aereo-pause-supreme-court-ruling-chet-kanojia">suspended its service</a> in the wake of the decision while it determines if it can find a way to continue, while its streaming-TV competitors <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/after-supreme-court-ruling-aereos-rivals-in-tv-streaming-seize-opening.html">began to move in</a> on its spot in the market.</p>
<p>Techdirt&#8217;s <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140625/09340227683/supreme-court-uses-bizarre-looks-like-cable-duck-test-to-outlaw-aereo.shtml">Mike Masnick</a>, Public Knowledge attorney <a href="http://bergmayer.info/post/89884947355">John Bergmayer</a>, and Notre Dame law professor <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/06/abc_v_aereo_ruling_the_supreme_court_s_terrible_technological_analogies.single.html">Mark McKenna</a> all critiqued the legal foundations of the decision, concluding that its vague definition of why Aereo was substantially like a cable system provides little guidance for future cases and leaves the door open for a raft of legal challenges and differing conclusions. At The Guardian, Julian Sanchez <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/25/supreme-court-aereo-ruling-cloud-computing">argued</a> that if future courts don&#8217;t care much about technological differences between Aereo and cable systems, the ruling&#8217;s precedent could endanger a whole range of cloud-based services, and Vox&#8217;s Timothy B. Lee <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/25/5841820/the-supreme-courts-aereo-decision-could-endanger-cloud-storage">made a similar point</a> about the perilous future of cloud storage. Gigaom&#8217;s Derrick Harris said the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/26/after-aereo-why-dropbox-is-safe-but-your-dvr-might-not-be-and-networks-need-to-embrace-digital-data/">impact on cloud services</a> won&#8217;t be as severe as feared, but DVR could be challenged.</p>
<p>Fox has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/fox-aereo-ruling-against-dish-streaming">already used</a> the Aereo decision to support its case against a streaming-TV service by Dish, and Variety&#8217;s Ted Johnson <a href="http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/the-aereo-decision-5-likely-scenarios-for-whats-next-1201247091/">looked more closely</a> at several possible outcomes from the ruling: Increasing TV bills and retransmission fees, more timidity among startups, and a broader legal definition of what constitutes a &#8220;public performance.&#8221; Forbes&#8217; Sarah Jeong said <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahjeong/2014/06/25/well-never-know-the-internet-we-lost/">we&#8217;ll never know the innovative startups</a> we&#8217;ve lost as a result of this ruling.</p>
<p>Recode&#8217;s Peter Kafka said that while the decision helps the TV industry in the short run, it <a href="http://recode.net/2014/06/25/the-tv-industrial-complex-stays-put-for-now/">could hamper its development in the long run</a>, since a legal Aereo would have pushed it to innovate more aggressively in light of its inevitable disruption. Instead, he said, &#8220;they’ll be sticking with lucrative business as usual for now. Pretty sure we’ve seen this show before.&#8221; Michael Learmonth of the International Business Times <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/what-aereo-google-told-us-about-tv-business-today-1611920">made a similar point</a>. At the Columbia Journalism Review, Sarah Laskow said <a href="http://www.cjr.org/cloud_control/aereo_scotus.php">local TV news may have avoided catastrophe</a> with the ruling, since a decision in Aereo&#8217;s favor may have eventually meant reduced retransmission fee revenue or even a move by the networks to pay TV.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution and continued questions in hacking case</strong>: After at least three years at the center of the British media spotlight, News Corp.&#8217;s phone hacking scandal reached something resembling a denouement last week, when the trial of two of its principal figures <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/world/europe/rebekah-brooks-found-not-guilty-in-phone-hacking-case.html?_r=0">concluded with the acquittal</a> of Rebekah Brooks and the conviction of her deputy, Andy Coulson, on a conspiracy charge. Brooks, the former head of Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s British newspaper holdings, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/26/rebekah-brooks-phone-hacking-statement_n_5533769.html">proclaimed herself &#8220;vindicated&#8221;</a> by her acquittal <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/06/25/news-corp-silent-speculation-rebekah-brooks-could-be-deployed-australia">amid speculation</a> News Corp. might deploy her to Australia. Coulson, the former editor of the now-defunct News Corp. tabloid News of the World, was hired as Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s spokesman in 2010, a move for which Cameron <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/06/25/news-corp-silent-speculation-rebekah-brooks-could-be-deployed-australia">apologized last week</a>.</p>
<p>News Corp.&#8217;s trouble is certainly not over, though. Scotland Yard <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/24/scotland-yard-want-interview-rupert-murdoch-phone-hacking">informed Murdoch it wants to interview him</a> in their investigation into the phone-hacking case, and in the U.S., <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/26/us-britain-hacking-investigation-idUSKBN0F12VD20140626">the FBI is still investigating</a> whether anyone from the company may have broken American law. The Daily Beast&#8217;s Peter Jukes <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/25/rupert-murdoch-s-trouble-has-only-just-begun.html">reported</a> that the FBI has 80,000 emails from News Corp.&#8217;s New York servers, and the Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Ryan Chittum said that while it will take quite a bit of firepower to go after Murdoch, <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/rupert_murdoch_and_news_corps.php">his potential influence is being substantially diminished</a>.</p>
<p>At USA Today, Michael Wolff <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2014/06/24/rebekah-brooks-hacking-verdict-murdoch/11306741/">noted</a> how Murdoch was distanced from Brooks&#8217; and Coulson&#8217;s trial, and The New Yorker&#8217;s Ken Auletta <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/06/an-incomplete-phone-hacking-verdict.html?currentPage=all">wondered</a> whether the British tabloid press will be chastened by the embarrassment that the trial was for their industry. At The Guardian, Suzanne Moore said the scandal <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/25/rebekah-brooks-journalists-politicians-phone-hacking-trial">exposed the coziness</a> between British journalists and politicians, and The Economist said it <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21606013-downfall-david-camerons-former-press-secretary-has-damaged-british-democracy-andy-coulsons?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/ed/andycoulsonmalignlegacy">diminished the political importance</a> of the British press.</p>
<p>The Telegraph argued that the trial was an <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/10922935/Scandal-that-could-not-scupper-press-freedom.html">underwhelming spectacle</a> that ultimately showed there isn&#8217;t a conspiracy among the press against the public, but in a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/25/-sp-phone-hacking-trial-rebekah-brooks-rupert-murdoch">scathing review of the scandal and the trial</a>, The Guardian&#8217;s Nick Davies said that despite the not-guilty verdicts, the News Corp. newspaper empire&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/25/-sp-phone-hacking-trial-rebekah-brooks-rupert-murdoch">corruption and coarsening of British public culture</a> was on full display. The Independent&#8217;s Cahal Milmo and James Musick also <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/andy-coulson-guilty-in-phone-hacking-trial-we-need-a-hit-badly-how-culture-of-news-of-the-worlds-glory-days-led-to-its-downfall-9559699.html">reviewed News of the World&#8217;s behavior in the scandal</a>, emphasizing its willingness to cut ethical corners in order to land scoops.</p>
<p>The Guardian also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/24/news-international-was-media-giant-out-of-control">expressed its hope</a> that the era in which the British tabloid insisted that there was no right to privacy had ended. &#8220;In its place should come respect for the universal right to privacy, honoured by all those who wield power – a mighty news company no less than the state itself,&#8221; the editorial stated. The Guardian&#8217;s media columnist, Roy Greenslade, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/26/1">criticized the British press</a> for its shoddy coverage of the case.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt jails three journalists</strong>: Three Al Jazeera English journalists who had been arrested in Egypt in December were sentenced last week to seven to 10 years in prison on dubious terrorism-related charges after a surreal and chaotic trial. The Guardian had a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/al-jazeera-journalists-jailed-seven-years-egypt">vivid account</a> of the verdict, while The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/world/middleeast/egyptian-court-convicts-3-al-jazeera-journalists.html">focused on the response</a> by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Journalists around the world <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/al-jazeera-journalists-egypt-jailed_n_5531283.html">rallied to the jailed trio&#8217;s cause</a>, including <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27988754">protests by hundreds of journalists</a> in London. The Committee to Protect Journalists <a href="http://cpj.org/blog/2014/06/egypts-shame.php">condemned the verdict</a> as a politicized result with no connection to the law, asserting that &#8220;Egypt cannot be allowed to normalize its international relationships so long as it continues to jail journalists.&#8221; Despite the pressure from numerous Western governments, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/world/middleeast/egyptian-leader-refuses-to-intervene-in-al-jazeera-case.html">wouldn&#8217;t interfere with the court&#8217;s decision</a>.</p>

<p><b>Reading roundup</b>: A few of the other stories and discussions that have merited some attention over the past couple of weeks:</p>
<p>— Poynter&#8217;s Andrew Beaujon <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/256936/almost-half-of-the-nyts-blogs-will-close-or-merge/">reported</a> that The New York Times will close more than half of its blogs, including its aggregative news blog The Lede, as part of a long move away from blogs at the paper. Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/26/can-the-new-york-times-kill-its-blogs-without-losing-the-soul-of-blogging-in-the-process/">expressed concern</a> that The Times will lose some of the innovative drive that came with the blogs, though Times public editor Margaret Sullivan said moving away from blogs <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/02/whats-gained-and-lost-as-the-times-ends-many-blogs/">could be a good thing</a> for The Times to encourage continual experimentation, as long as its journalists can integrate what they&#8217;ve learned from them into the rest of their work. Blogging pioneer Dave Winer said The Times&#8217; blogs <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/06/27/iKnowWhatABlogIs.html">were never truly blogs</a> because they were edited and impersonal, while PandoDaily&#8217;s David Holmes <a href="http://pando.com/2014/06/27/stop-obsessing-about-what-a-blog-is-in-2014-its-all-just-writing/">countered</a> that we shouldn&#8217;t worry about what&#8217;s blogging and what&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>— SCOTUSblog, one of the top sources of U.S. Supreme Court news and analysis, had its appeal for a congressional press pass from the Senate Daily Press Gallery denied last week based on concerns about it independence from the law practice of its publisher, Tom Goldstein. Goldstein <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/06/the-walls-erected-by-traditional-media/">wrote a defense</a> of his site&#8217;s credentialing case, one echoed by Talking Points Memo&#8217;s <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-law-is-an-ass">Josh Marshall</a> and Techdirt&#8217;s <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140623/18023027662/jealous-journalistic-competitors-reject-again-scotusblogs-request-press-pass.shtml">Mike Masnick</a>. The Columbia Journalism Review <a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/scotusblog_press_credential_denied_disappointing_preference_traditional_news_media.php?page=all">reviewed the history</a> of SCOTUSblog&#8217;s application to the Senate press gallery to critique the gallery&#8217;s decision. SCOTUSblog also got <a href="http://newsguild.org/node/4032">support from the Newspaper Guild-CWA</a>.</p>
<p>— Upworthy <a href="http://blog.upworthy.com/post/89621755036/the-code-literally-to-what-lies-between-the-click-and">released the source code</a> for its preferred metric, attention minutes, which focuses on time spent on a site rather than number of visits or shares. BuzzFeed explained <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mylestanzer/upworthy-wants-you-to-play-by-its-rules">what&#8217;s in it for Upworthy</a>, and Digiday&#8217;s <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/buyers-sold-attention-minutes/">Ricardo Bilton</a>, the Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/upworthy_attention_minutes.php?page=all">Fiona Lowenstein</a>, and Gigaom&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/23/is-time-spent-a-better-metric-than-pageviews-upworthy-says-it-is-and-open-sources-its-code-for-attention-minutes/">Mathew Ingram</a> all looked at what other publishers think of using attention as a primary metric.</p>
<p>— Finally, the Columbia Journalism Review <a href="http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/washington_post_jeff_bezos.php?page=all">went deep</a> into Jeff Bezos&#8217; efforts to restore The Washington Post&#8217;s global ambition. It&#8217;s a lengthy, well-reported look at some important changes underway there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[This review was originally posted at the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/this-week-in-review-time-inc-tries-to-survive-on-its-own-and-the-global-shift-to-mobile-news/">Nieman Journalism Lab</a> on June 13, 2014.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The most important pieces to read this week are the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism&#8217;s <a href="http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/">online news consumption study</a>, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/the-newsonomics-of-time-inc-s-anxious-spinoff/">Ken Doctor</a> on Time Inc.&#8217;s strategy, and The Atlantic&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/method-journalism/372526/">Alexis Madrigal</a> on method journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Magazine survival on the web</strong>: Time Inc. completed its split from its parent company, Time Warner, at the end of last week, and the occasion was generally an ominous one for the U.S.&#8217; largest magazine publisher. While Time Warner&#8217;s stock rose after the move, Time Inc.&#8217;s <a href="http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/time-stock-falls-spin-off-time-warner-1201216350/">dropped 4.6%</a> in its first morning trading as a standalone magazine company.</p>
<p>With no lucrative media properties elsewhere in the company to prop it up, Time Inc. faces an uphill journey to financial viability, to say the least. An Agence France Presse article <a href="http://www.afp.com/en/news/spinoff-takes-time-inc-back-future">laid out the basic case for pessimism</a> about Time Inc. — and the vote of no confidence that its split means for the magazine industry as a whole. But Bloomberg&#8217;s Edmund Lee <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-05/time-inc-s-solo-debut-raises-pressure-on-move-to-digital-1-.html">noted some reasons for optimism</a>: Time Inc. will be able to reinvest its profits rather than sending them up to Time Warner, and several other print-based media companies, like the recently spun-off News Corp., have been up recently.</p>
<p>The New York Times&#8217; David Carr and Ravi Somaiya <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/business/media/time-inc-to-set-a-lonely-course-after-a-spinoff.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0">gave some more details</a> on the difficulties of Time Inc.&#8217;s situation, the circumstances that led to the merger, and reported that the company is expected to cut 25% of editorial costs in the next few months. The Atlantic&#8217;s Derek Thompson <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/time-inc-has-a-big-problemso-does-digital-journalism/372460/">outlined the advertising conundrum</a> in which Time Inc. and other legacy publishers find themselves: Advertising attention and revenue is plummeting in print, but the attention online and in mobile is too scattershot and fleeting to bring in big money right now. <strong>&#8220;My bet is that small, niche, and premium digital journalism survives with high CPMs and light costs, while big, broad, and everything-for-everyone journalism struggles with low CPMs and heavy ambitions,&#8221;</strong> Thompson concluded.</p>
<p>So Time Inc. needs to go beyond magazines and move into fresh, robust digital offerings. But, of course, Time already knows this — the question is how. The Lab&#8217;s Ken Doctor <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/the-newsonomics-of-time-inc-s-anxious-spinoff/">offered several suggestions</a>: Move deeper into less competitive niches, go from reading to doing, go mobile-friendly and visual, and target TV and web video for disruption. Gigaom&#8217;s Mathew Ingram <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/09/time-inc-is-independent-but-saddled-with-debt-and-digitally-adrift-3-things-it-needs-to-do/">echoed some of those ideas</a>, urging Time Inc. to undertake a complete rethink of its culture, platforms, and business model.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mobile news consumption around the world</strong>: Oxford&#8217;s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/about/news/item/article/news-organisations-face-second-wave.html">released its annual study</a> on digital news consumption around the world, with findings that centered on the continued shift toward consuming news on smartphones, through quick, small-scale news &#8220;snacking.&#8221; In his summary of the report, The Guardian&#8217;s Roy Greenslade <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jun/12/digital-media-social-media">noted</a> that mainstream news media in some countries are doing much better than others in retaining market share in this environment, and that the market is being more deeply segmented through the generational divide in the use of smartphones.</p>
<p>The BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27772070">emphasized the good news</a> for traditional news organizations, pointing out that they remain the dominant news sources in the UK, while also stating that &#8220;There&#8217;s a new class of press baron, Facebook Superfriends or Twitterati, who are increasingly playing a role in driving the news agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lab&#8217;s Joseph Lichterman <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/more-people-around-the-world-are-getting-news-on-phones-but-paying-for-it-is-still-rare/">looked more closely</a> at the study&#8217;s data on mobile news consumption, highlighting the findings that people use fewer news sources on mobile and prefer text to video overall, though very few of them pay for news in any form. (Also at the Lab, Joshua Benton <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/the-mobile-majority-engaging-people-on-smartphones-is-the-next-big-challenge-to-the-news/">wrote about the challenges</a> in engaging the growing number of mobile news users.)</p>
<p>And British journalism professor Richard Sambrook <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2014/jun/12/objectivity-and-impartiality-in-digital-news-coverage">examined the study&#8217;s finding</a> that most users said they trust organizations with traditional, objectivity-based reporters more than ones that practice alternative forms. <strong>&#8220;Audiences appear more attached to the traditional norms of balanced and impartial news than some might suppose,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;The question going forward is how well that sits among the growing range of digital services seeking to establish themselves by adopting a point of view to maximise impact.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sorting through the Register&#8217;s decline</strong>: After the Orange County Register <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-register-problems-20140604-story.html">announced widespread cuts and buyouts</a> last week, dozens of staffers have been lining up for the buyouts, with the rest bracing for layoffs when the round of buyouts ends. The cuts are expected to wipe out all of staff positions the Register added in its daring print expansion over the past two years, according to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-register-layoffs-20140610-story.html">Los Angeles Times</a>.</p>
<p>The paper&#8217;s owner, Aaron Kushner of Freedom Communications, was resolute in his insistence to Register staff that the paper was not dying; OC Weekly has <a href="http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2014/06/layoffs_aaron_kushner_oc_register.php">more details</a> from Kushner&#8217;s Q&amp;A with staff, as well as a <a href="http://blogs.ocweekly.com/navelgazing/2014/06/oc_register_on_expected_layoffsbuyouts_its_going_to_be_a_fucking_bloodbath.php">quote from an anonymous Register</a> staffer saying that &#8220;He&#8217;s lost the newsroom. No one has any faith in him at all. People want to get the hell out while they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Ryan Chittum <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/why_the_orange_county_register.php?page=all">looked at the minimal margin for error</a> built into the Register&#8217;s financial plans and said the flaws in the its strategy are becoming apparent: Even if revenue is up, it&#8217;s not enough to support the massive investment in staff and geographical expansion, and the Register has neglected the digital side of its operation. <strong>&#8220;The bet on better journalism was always the key to success, not the emphasis on print itself,&#8221;</strong> he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: A few other stories to keep an eye on this week:</p>
<p>— A few notes on Vox and explanatory journalism: Vox executive Michael Lovitt talked about <a href="http://product.voxmedia.com/2014/6/6/5673934/nine-weeks-to-launch-vox">how the site was built and launched</a> in just nine weeks, and the Lab&#8217;s Joshua Benton <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/how-vox-com-was-built-in-9-weeks-not-9-months/">marveled</a> at how quickly they did it. Vox&#8217;s Melissa Bell <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/9/5792136/the-homepage-is-dead-we-re-building-one-anyway">explained</a> why the site is still using a homepage, despite the homepage&#8217;s widely discussed decline. The Economist looked at <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/06/economist-explains-3">why explanatory sites are becoming more popular</a>, and the Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Corey Hutchins <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/the_case_for_voxsplaining_the_local_news.php?page=all">called for more</a> Vox-style explaining in local news.</p>
<p>— The Center for Public Interest Journalism at Temple University in Philadelphia shut down its nonprofit news site AxisPhilly late last week, but will launch a new news venture called Brother.ly run by Washington Post, TBD, and Digital First veteran Jim Brady. Here&#8217;s the article on the move from <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/06/06/axisphilly-jim-brady/">Technically Philly</a>, and announcements from <a href="http://axisphilly.org/article/axisphilly-to-cease-operations/">AxisPhilly</a> and <a href="http://www.cpijournalism.org/2014/06/06/update-from-the-center-for-public-interest-journalism/">Temple</a>.</p>
<p>— BuzzFeed&#8217;s Jonah Peretti gave a <a href="https://medium.com/matter/buzzfeeds-jonah-peretti-goes-long-e98cf13160e7">mammoth, 22,000-word interview</a> to Fusion&#8217;s Felix Salmon, and fortunately, the Lab&#8217;s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/inside-jonah-peretti-on-lacanian-psychoanalysis-not-wasting-time-on-the-mediocre-and-the-god-metric/">Caroline O&#8217;Donovan</a> and Gigaom&#8217;s <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/11/the-seven-most-interesting-things-buzzfeed-founder-jonah-peretti-said-to-felix-salmon-in-his-massive-interview/">Mathew Ingram</a> rounded up the most interesting pieces of it for you.</p>
<p>— Finally, The Atlantic&#8217;s Alexis Madrigal <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/method-journalism/372526/">wrote about the spate of new sites</a> that are devoted a particular method, rather than a topic or subject area. <strong>&#8220;It seems absurd to say that we need some more publications that are <em>about something</em>,&#8221; Madrigal concluded. &#8220;But that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at.&#8221;</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[This review was originally posted at the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/this-week-in-review-a-setback-for-reporter-privilege-and-a-new-new-york-times-opinion-app/">Nieman Journalism Lab</a> on June 6, 2014.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The key pieces to read this week are The Atlantic&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/whos-going-to-buy-the-new-york-timess-new-opinion-app/372138/">Robinson Meyer</a> on the NYT Opinion app, <a href="http://towcenter.org/blog/the-art-and-science-of-data-driven-journalism/">Alexander Howard&#8217;s report</a> on data-driven journalism, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-one-year-nsa-surveillance-reform">Spencer Ackerman</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/05/what-snowden-revealed-changed-nsa-reform">Trevor Timm</a> at The Guardian on the Edward Snowden documents a year later.</p>
<p><strong>James Risen&#8217;s case hits a wall</strong>: New York Times reporter James Risen&#8217;s long legal battle against being forced to reveal the name of a confidential source in legal testimony reached a dead-end in the courts this week. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal of a federal ruling against him, leaving the matter up to the Department of Justice to resolve.</p>
<p>As The Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/us/james-risen-faces-jail-time-for-refusing-to-identify-a-confidential-source.html">reported</a>, it&#8217;s now up to the Justice Department to determine whether it wants to compel him to testify — and jail him if he refuses. The Obama administration has sent mixed signals: In its brief on the case, it said reporters have no privilege to refuse to testify about confidential sources, but Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/AP999e905bbf294d1b8a9cfc83db089522.html">reportedly told journalists last week </a>that no reporter doing his or her job will go to jail.</p>
<p>Risen vowed to continue to fight, but as The Washington Post&#8217;s Erik Wemple <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/06/02/after-supreme-court-punts-its-nyts-risen-against-the-justice-department/">noted</a>, he&#8217;s already been fighting for six years, and even if the government pulls up short of forcing jail time now, it still may leave a real chilling effect on the press. Wemple also gave some background on the legal case, as did Fortune&#8217;s Roger Parloff, who <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/06/01/why-the-supreme-court-should-hear-james-risens-case/">argued</a> for the Supreme Court to take the case.</p>
<p>USA Today&#8217;s Rem Rieder <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2014/06/02/supreme-court-ducks-opportunity-on-reporters-privilege/9864627/">expressed his hope</a> that Risen&#8217;s setback would spur Congress to pass a shield law protecting journalists from testifying. And late last week, ABC News&#8217; Mike Levine <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/justice-dept-vows-jail-reporters-jobs/story?id=23915952&amp;singlePage=true">revealed</a> that he had been subpoenaed by the government to reveal a confidential source in 2011 when he worked for Fox News, but the Justice Department dropped the fight after just more than a year. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/us/politics/amid-moves-on-shield-laws-a-journalist-tells-of-2011-subpoena-fight.html">added some background</a> on Levine&#8217;s case and the shield law fight.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>The plan behind NYT Opinion</strong>: The New York Times launched its second specialized subscription app (after NYT Now this spring) this week: A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/opinion/announcing-nytopinion.html">new opinion-only app</a> called NYT Opinion. It&#8217;ll cost $6 per four weeks, and the app will include two main streams: One of all The Times&#8217; columnists and op-ed pieces, and the other called Op-Talk which will offer a selection of opinion from around the web chosen by Times editors. Between the Op-Talk feature and NYT Now&#8217;s aggregative approach, as TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/04/new-york-times-steps-up-its-premium-march-with-nyt-opinion-app/">noted</a>, The Times seems to be trying to position itself as an aggregator, but it in a way that separates its own content from the web&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The app is the first of The Times&#8217; new digital subscription options to focus on a particular content type, but it&#8217;s not the first time The Times has charged specifically for its opinion content: From 2005 to 2007, it put its opinion content behind a paywall called TimesSelect. The Atlantic&#8217;s Robinson Meyer <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/whos-going-to-buy-the-new-york-timess-new-opinion-app/372138/">examined the differences</a> between this effort and that one (it&#8217;s not a hard paywall — that&#8217;s the big one), and wondered who this app is intended for. The answer from The Times was that it&#8217;s for people who are already up on the news, but are particularly interested in The Times&#8217; op-ed content.</p>
<p>Meyer wondered if NYT Opinion could be compared to Slate&#8217;s membership program Slate Plus, with both banking on a long-standing reputation for compelling opinions as the once-exploding blogosphere starts to get gobbled up by established media outlets. <strong>&#8220;Maybe there’s an opening now for readers to support the institutions—and the voices—they come back to. NYT Opinion provides just that,&#8221;</strong> he wrote.</p>
<p>The Awl&#8217;s Matt Buchanan said that as The Times gets unbundled in app form, <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/06/the-unbundling-of-the-times">it&#8217;s worth questioning</a> whether each chunk can stand on its own as well as they all did as a whole. Writer and designer Craig Mod, meanwhile, <a href="https://medium.com/message/coming-home-nyt-now-e3fc26f60a59">gave NYT Now</a> an enthusiastic review, and media analyst Steve Outing <a href="http://mediadisruptus.com/2014/06/03/what-if-nyt-ended-daily-print/">wondered what would happen</a> if The Times cut its print edition.</p>

<p><strong>A set of Apple announcements</strong>: Apple made a slew of product announcements this week in its keynote at its annual developers&#8217; conference. If you want to know all about all of them, you can dive into the couple hundred posts <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/140603/h0640">pulled together on Techmeme</a>, but here&#8217;s a quick rundown: Apple unveiled a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-introduces-ios-8/">new iOS</a> (iOS 8) for its mobile devices, a <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/281863/everything-want-know-os-x-yosemite/">new operating system</a> for its desktops (OS X Yosemite), a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/apples-swift-explained-what-it-is-and-what-it-means/">new programming language</a> (Swift), a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5771942/apple-announces-icloud-drive">new file-sharing system</a> (iCloud Drive), a <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/06/03/much-ado-about-homekit-the-new-apple-smart-home-framework/">new smart home framework</a> (HomeKit), a <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/06/02/apple-health-initiative/">new health API for developers</a> (HealthKit), and a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apples-imessage-adds-self-destructing-audio-and-video-messages-location-sharing/">revamped messaging system</a>.</p>
<p>A few of the more substantive posts coming out of that set of announcements: Fast Company&#8217;s Chris Dannen <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3031400/whats-new-and-different-about-apples-new-swift-programming-language">looked at Swift&#8217;s move</a> toward the more popular scripting languages of the web like JavaScript and Python, and The Verge&#8217;s Ben Popper <a href="http://www.theverge.com/apple/2014/6/2/5773928/apple-swift-programming-developers-objective-c">wrote about the idea</a> that this shift will draw a larger pool of iOS developers. The Atlantic&#8217;s Megan Garber <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/your-home-theres-an-app-for-that/372032/">looked at HomeKit</a> as Apple&#8217;s attempt to standardize the world of objects as it moves into &#8220;the Internet of things,&#8221; and TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden pointed out <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/taking-direct-aim-at-google-apple-puts-search-front-and-center/">the increasing centrality of search</a> for Apple and the simultaneous crowding out of Google in its products.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Southern California newspaper setback</strong>: Just two months after it launched a new daily paper in Los Angeles, Freedom Communications, the owner of the Orange County Register and Los Angeles Register, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-register-problems-20140604-story.html">announced a range of cuts</a> this week, including a merger of the Long Beach Register, which it launched last year, with its L.A. paper, mandatory two-week furloughs, buyouts intended to cut 100 jobs, and a 25% drop in print news space.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/the-newsonomics-of-the-orange-county-registers-swerves-all-over-the-freeway/">typically authoritative analysis</a>, the Lab&#8217;s Ken Doctor described the changes as &#8220;a big red flag, screaming <em>we’re running out of money really soon</em>, following numerous months of yellow flags.&#8221; Journalism professor Dan Kennedy said that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-kennedy/aaron-kushners-latest-cut_b_5446255.html">signs don&#8217;t look good</a> for the strategy of Freedom owner Aaron Kushner, and his pockets aren&#8217;t as deep as other recent news investors, like The Boston Globe&#8217;s John Henry, to ride out the rough patches of local newspaper experimentation. USA Today&#8217;s Rem Rieder <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2014/06/03/reversals-at-orange-county-register/9915629/">commended Kushner for trying his bold plan</a>, but said the odds of its success are getting longer.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: There was quite a few other interesting developments and conversations happening this week. Here&#8217;s a quick rundown:</p>
<p>— A year after Edward Snowden released his trove of documents on U.S. National Security Agency surveillance, The Guardian&#8217;s Spencer Ackerman <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/edward-snowden-one-year-nsa-surveillance-reform">took stock</a> of where the issue stands and Trevor Timm of the Freedom of the Press Foundation <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/05/what-snowden-revealed-changed-nsa-reform">looked at four ways</a> Snowden&#8217;s act changed the landscape of surveillance and cybersecurity. The Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/guardian-launches-securedrop-whistleblowers-documents?CMP=twt_gu">launched a leaking platform</a> for whistleblowers called SecureDrop, and Microsoft <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/04/microsoft-calls-on-us-gov-to-end-bulk-nsa-data-collection/">called on the U.S. government</a> to end bulk data collection.</p>
<p>— The American Prospect <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mylestanzer/american-prospect-mass-exodus-begins">announced last week</a> that it&#8217;s shifting back to its roots as a quarterly policy journal, scaling back its digital operation and laying off or losing most of its staff. Vox&#8217;s Ezra Klein, an American Prospect alum, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/3/5774198/remembering-tapped-the-birthplace-of-the-policy-blogosphere">reflected</a> on the outsized influence the Prospect had on online policy news and commentary, and The Washington Post&#8217;s Alyssa Rosenberg <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/05/30/the-fate-of-the-american-prospect-and-what-keeps-a-journalism-ecosystem-healthy/">looked at the difficulty</a> of being an incubator for online journalism as the Prospect was.</p>
<p>— Two fantastic resources on data and journalism were published in the past week: The Tow Center&#8217;s Alexander Howard&#8217;s extensive report (<a href="http://towcenter.org/blog/the-art-and-science-of-data-driven-journalism/">summary</a> and <a href="http://towcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tow-Center-Data-Driven-Journalism.pdf">PDF</a>) on how data-driven journalism is done, and Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford on <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-anxieties-of-big-data/">the anxieties of big data</a>.</p>
<p>— A couple of other interesting studies released this week: The Tow Center <a href="http://towcenter.org/blog/tow-center-launches-amateur-footage-a-global-study-of-user-generated-content-in-tv-and-online-news-output/">published a study</a> on the use of user-generated content in global TV and online news, and a group of organizations led by the Digital Media Law Project <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/credentials/">released a study</a> examining who gets press credentials (and who doesn&#8217;t) and why. You can read pieces on the study at the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/survey_one_in_five_journalists_has_had_credential_request_denied.php?page=all">Columbia Journalism Review</a> and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/who-gets-press-passes-a-new-survey-looks-at-how-journalists-are-being-credentialed-or-not/">here at the Lab</a>.</p>
<p>— Finally, two fascinating peeks behind the curtain at NPR: Melody Kramer <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/building-smart-newsroom-tools/">described at Source</a> how she and Wright Bryan developed a data analytics dashboard for NPR journalists, and Brian Boyer <a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org/2014/06/04/how-we-work.html">explained</a> how the NPR visuals team works.</p>

<p>The study:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2013.836378#.U4_INvldUkI">Tweeting conventions: Political journalists&#8217; use of Twitter to cover the 2012 presidential campaign</a>, by Regina G. Lawrence, Logan Molyneux, Mark Coddington, and Avery Holton. <em>Journalism Studies</em>. (It&#8217;s paywalled, but I&#8217;ll send you a PDF copy if you email at markcoddington at gmail dot com.)</p>
<p><strong>What were you trying to find out?</strong></p>
<p>The idea for this study came from <a href="http://journalism.utexas.edu/faculty/regina-lawrence">Regina Lawrence</a>, a professor at the University of Texas (where I&#8217;m a Ph.D. student) who&#8217;s been studying how political journalists do their job for a couple of decades. As frantic and spastic as political journalism (and especially campaign journalism) may seem at times, it&#8217;s actually one of the most stable and settled forms of journalism we have in the U.S. The idiosyncrasies of political journalism were first nailed down in a definitive way in the early 1970s, and have been the subject of countless exposés and jeremiads since then — most famously, in journalism, in Timothy Crouse&#8217;s classic on the 1972 campaign, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Bus-Timothy-Crouse/dp/0812968204/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401932570&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=boys+on+the+bus">The Boys on the Bus</a>,&#8221; and in academia, in Thomas Patterson&#8217;s early 1990s critique of the campaign process, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-Order-incisive-domination-political/dp/0679755101/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401932634&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=out+of+order">Out of Order</a>.&#8221; And frankly, they haven&#8217;t changed much since then.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably familiar with how campaign journalism works and why it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Heck, you&#8217;ve probably ranted about it a few (or a few hundred) times yourself. But just to spell out exactly what we&#8217;re all talking (and ranting) about, here are a few of the very well-defined traits that have made American campaign journalism so easy to loathe for the past few decades:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectivity</strong>: It&#8217;s ostensibly built around the idea that journalists can and should separate their opinions and values from the facts on which they&#8217;re reporting. But objectivity often turns out to just mean a &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; style of reporting that refuses to do the work to evaluate competing claims and instead leaves them to us to scratch our heads over. It&#8217;s meant to undergird a certain rigor in reporting, but on the campaign trail, it often means journalists pass on campaigns&#8217; claims without basic fact-checking.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>: Objectivity does leave some wiggle room: Reporters often work within it to write more interpretively about how campaigns are trying to woo and manipulate voters (more on this in the next point). But the candidates&#8217; attempts to manipulate and negotiate with reporters themselves have historically been off-limits (though this is changing a bit). What&#8217;s still an unmentioned issue among most reporters is their own influence in how campaigns are run — part of <a href="http://pressthink.org/2011/08/why-political-coverage-is-broken/">what Jay Rosen calls</a> &#8220;the production of innocence.&#8221; Journalists are a key part of setting the rules of political game, but we don&#8217;t hear much — certainly not from them — about their own role.</li>
<li><strong>Horse-race journalism</strong>: Journalists&#8217; preference for reporting on strategy and gamesmanship rather than issues and substance is one of best-documented aspects of their campaign coverage. This style allows them to write incisively about the campaign while avoid charges of partisanship, but despite this show of independence, it can end up deeply influencing the trajectory of the campaign. It also leaves voters ill-informed about the voting decision they&#8217;re making.</li>
<li><strong>Insider journalism</strong>: Partly because of the grueling and insular environment of campaign reporting that Crouse documented, it&#8217;s been especially prone to insider-ism — a relatively bounded group of journalists talking to itself and to an even more tightly bounded set of sources from within and around the campaigns, and using this very narrow range of perspectives to gauge the conventional wisdom about the campaign. The result is a form of journalism and opinion that seems very removed from the concerns and viewpoints of people outside this bubble, and can be <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/nate-silver-led-statistics-men-crush-pundits-in-election.html">very easily debunked</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&#8217;s campaign journalism as we&#8217;ve known it. But this is a pretty old model of political journalism, one that&#8217;s rooted in what <a href="http://www.jour.unr.edu/pcr/1601_2005_winter/commentary_hallin.htm">Dan Hallin called</a> the &#8220;high modernism&#8221; of American journalism — an era in the late 20th century when traditional journalism was powerful, prosperous, stable, and pretty much got to dominate the public sphere. But all of that has changed: Professional journalism&#8217;s stability and authority have been rocked by a variety of forces — economic, social, political, and technological. The one we wanted to look most closely at was the environment for politics on Twitter, which could potentially challenge each one of these conventions of campaign journalism:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectivity</strong>: Giving your opinions on things seems to be a core function of Twitter — if you&#8217;re not sharing any of your opinions, you look like you don&#8217;t know how to use it, or at the very least, everyone thinks you&#8217;re pretty boring. So the norms of Twitter would seem to work against the careful, studied objectivity of traditional journalism.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of transparency</strong>: Here we run into another of Twitter&#8217;s key uses (for better or worse): Sharing the mundane details of your day-to-day life. To the extent that those details involve reporters&#8217; work, that&#8217;s an opportunity for a level of transparency we haven&#8217;t seen before.</li>
<li><strong>Horse-race journalism</strong>: Here, the difference on Twitter might be more indirect. The public has repeatedly said in surveys that it prefers substantive issues to strategy coverage, so <em>if</em> social media users resemble the public in that respect and <i>if</i> they voice those preferences to journalists and <em>if</em> those journalists are listening and responding, then we might see some reduction in horse-race journalism there.</li>
<li><strong>Insider journalism</strong>: It&#8217;s easy to see how this might change on Twitter, which opens the door for so many people outside the traditional media/political arena to have a voice, gain a following, and earn the attention of a small sliver of the American public. If that sliver includes political journalists, it could go a long way toward helping them open their reporting beyond the usual insiders.</li>
</ul>
<p>In light of this potential, our overarching question was a pretty simple one: Do these classic attributes of campaign journalism still hold in the Twitter environment, or does something about them change?</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;d you do?</strong></p>
<p>We used a custom-built program based on Twitter&#8217;s API to gather political journalists&#8217; tweets during the 2012 presidential campaign, then systematically analyzed a sample of them manually for a variety of characteristics that could indicate these journalistic practices.</p>
<p>We started by gathering a sample of 430 political journalists and commentators to collect tweets from. We identified a range of news organizations on a variety of platforms — 19 national news organizations, both traditional (New York Times, CBS, CNN, NPR) and nontraditional (BuzzFeed, Slate, Politico), and 76 other local news organizations in battleground states based on campaign spending amounts. We used a <a href="http://www.cision.com/us/">database of media professionals</a> to find any staffers with politics or campaigns listed as part of their job description or coverage area, then found their professional Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>We collected all of their tweets between the start of the conventions in August 2012 through Election Day, but for this study we only used the period during both parties&#8217; conventions. We wanted a focused, bounded sample from a point when nearly all political media attention would be trained on the same political events, which would help minimize irrelevant tweets and extraneous variance in the journalists&#8217; situations, allow us to more efficiently and directly compare groups within the sample. We collected about 39,000 tweets during the conventions, and once we sampled a random subset of those tweets we ended up with 1,629 tweets to analyze, with the non-political ones being excluded from the main analysis.</p>
<p>We then did some quantitative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis">content analysis</a>, using five different people to go through each tweet manually and code it for several characteristics that we thought could help measure some of the dimensions we described earlier: Statements of opinions or personal identity and fact-checking for objectivity; talk about the journalists&#8217; work for transparency; discussion of candidate strategy, characteristics, and voting blocs (as opposed to issues) for horse-race journalism; and linking to and retweeting insider and outsider sources and seeking information from users for insider journalism.</p>
<p>One other note: I was the third author out of four on this paper, which in this case means I led the content analysis and chipped in on revisions of the review of literature and discussion of results.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;d you find out?</strong></p>
<p>The TL;DR version: <strong>Journalists showed some willingness to deviate a bit from their traditional norms regarding objectivity, transparency, and horse-race journalism. But despite Twitter&#8217;s potential to dramatically broaden the political conversation, they&#8217;re still as resolutely insular as ever.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with this chart, which should give you a basic overview of the tweeting patterns we found (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://markcoddington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Post-chart-image.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1563" alt="Post chart image" src="http://markcoddington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Post-chart-image.png" width="586" height="272" srcset="http://markcoddington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Post-chart-image.png 837w, http://markcoddington.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Post-chart-image-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectivity</strong>: Of the tweets we analyzed, 29% contained a statement of opinion, which we defined as using evaluative language or offering unattributed commentary beyond the facts of an issue. That&#8217;s a pretty high number, especially since we pitched the tweets that weren&#8217;t about the journalists&#8217; professional lives (i.e., work or politics). A sizable minority of our sample was made up of commentators rather than reporters, yet when we just included reporters, opinion was still at 24%. Interestingly, national reporters were significantly more likely to include opinions than local reporters, and not surprisingly, those in cable news were significantly more opinionated than those in broadcast news.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: The amount of talk about journalism was higher than we expected, too: 15% of the tweets contained some sort of information or comment about journalists doing their daily work. Those tweets tended not to include information about the rest of the campaign, whether horse-race or policy. Now, these daily-detail tweets probably fall more reliably into the category of &#8220;tedious navel-gazing&#8221; than any meaningful form of transparency. But they&#8217;re more than what we were getting before, which was pretty much zero.</li>
<li><strong>Horse-race journalism</strong>: This was, in our minds at least, the strangest finding. Only 2% of the tweets had a horse-race element, and only 5% mentioned a voting bloc. A bit more — 10% — mentioned a candidate characteristics (these were often paired with statements of opinion). But even more tweets than any of these (14%) mentioned a policy issue. This trend — more policy, less strategy — is the exact reverse of what&#8217;s been found over and over again in campaign journalism. So maybe there&#8217;s a bit more space for policy news and discussion on Twitter in the midst of campaigns than we thought. On the other hand, there may be methodological issues here: We had to define horse-race (whether a tweet mentioned a candidate&#8217;s position in polls or fundraising) and campaign strategy (mentioning a voting bloc) pretty narrowly in order to achieve reliability between coders. So there may be more horse-race talk that our study wasn&#8217;t able to pick up.</li>
<li><strong>Insider journalism</strong>: The results here weren&#8217;t surprising, but they were still dismal. Of the links in journalists&#8217; tweets, 90% were to professional news outlets (46% to the journalist&#8217;s own work), with only 10% going anywhere else. Of the journalists&#8217; retweets, 82% were other journalists, while 7% were what we defined as political insiders (candidates, campaign staff, consultants, interest groups), and just 11% were from anyone outside those two groups. Journalists also requested information from their followers in just 2% of all tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this study, political journalists on Twitter are loosening the traditional bounds of objectivity and horse-race journalism and even, to an extent, showing some transparency. And that&#8217;s a meaningful development, something for which journalists deserve some commendation. But their conversation is a performative one, rather than something that&#8217;s truly interactional. They&#8217;re talking with fellow journalists, with the rest of us simply watching their conversation; to the extent that we try to enter it, our efforts are generally futile. In other words, campaign journalism is still made almost exclusively by a set of boys on the proverbial bus, except the rest of us are now pressing our faces to the windows, straining to hear and be heard. We can pick up the loudest bits and pieces of their conversation, and they, it seems, can barely hear us at all.</p>

<p><strong>This week&#8217;s essential reads</strong>: The key articles this week were Michael Kinsley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/books/review/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald.html?_r=0">New York Times review</a> of Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s new book, the Lab&#8217;s <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-scariest-chart-in-mary-meekers-slide-deck-for-newspapers-has-gotten-a-little-scarier/">Joshua Benton</a> on the gap between mobile and print attention and advertising, and <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/newspaper_subscription_revenue.php?page=all">Ryan Chittum</a> of the Columbia Journalism Review on historical trends in newspapers&#8217; reliance on reader vs. advertising revenue.</p>
<p><strong>A new attack on Greenwald&#8217;s judgment</strong>: Late last week, political journalist and pundit Michael Kinsley launched a particularly contentious new round in the nearly year-old debate about the release of Edward Snowden&#8217;s documents about National Security Agency surveillance. Kinsley <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/books/review/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald.html?_r=0">delivered a scathing review</a> of Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s book &#8220;No Place to Hide&#8221; for The New York Times which described the book as self-righteously bombastic and concluded that the government should ultimately have the responsibility for determining what of its information gets released. &#8220;Someone gets to decide&#8221; what gets published, he wrote, &#8220;and that someone cannot be Glenn Greenwald.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kinsley&#8217;s review unleashed a storm of livid responses, with the Freedom of the Press Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/05/journalist-argues-ny-times-publishing-decisions-should-ultimately-be-made-government">Barry Eisler</a>, Gawker&#8217;s <a href="http://gawker.com/michael-kinsley-comes-out-against-journalism-1580220672">Hamilton Nolan</a>, and Firedoglake&#8217;s <a href="http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2014/05/22/in-nyt-review-of-greenwalds-book-vanity-fair-editor-endorses-prosecuting-journalists-who-publish-leaks/">Kevin Gosztola</a> all arguing that, as Nolan put it, &#8220;Michael Kinsley is coming out in opposition to journalism.&#8221; The Washington Post&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/05/22/michael-kinsley-on-glenn-greenwald-he-cannot-decide-what-secrets-get-published/">Erik Wemple</a> also argued that even though Kinsley says Greenwald can&#8217;t be trusted to decide what gets published, he doesn&#8217;t give any evidence that Greenwald&#8217;s mismanaged it. Greenwald also <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/05/23/response-michael-kinsley/">replied</a>, saying that Kinsley&#8217;s review was simply evidence of the complicity of Washington journalism with government authority.</p>
<p>Times public editor Margaret Sullivan <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/kinsley-greenwald-and-government-secrets/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">chastised</a> both Kinsley and the Times&#8217; Book Review editor, Pamela Paul, for the review, concluding that while the piece shouldn&#8217;t have been edited to change its point of view, &#8220;surely editing ought to point out gaping holes in an argument, remove ad hominem language and question unfair characterizations; that didn’t happen here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kinsley <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/michael-kinsley-responds-to-criticism-of-greenwald-review/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">responded to Sullivan</a> by saying she mischaracterized his argument as well as American legal protections for the press, and New York magazine&#8217;s Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/05/times-vs-sullivan-vs-kinsley-vs-greenwald.html">sided with Kinsley</a> regarding Sullivan&#8217;s response: &#8220;The notion that it’s wrong for the book review to print abhorrent reviews, let alone to poke fun at no less a hero than Glenn Greenwald, is an artifact of the culture of smugness that Kinsley is writing about here,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Kinsley&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t the only critical review of Greenwald&#8217;s book. At Prospect magazine, The New Yorker&#8217;s George Packer wrote a <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-errors-of-edward-snowden-and-glenn-greenwald/#.U4dGHvldUkL">more thorough, less personal but equally stinging critique</a> of Greenwald&#8217;s account and argument. On the other side, GQ <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201406/glenn-greenwald-edward-snowden-no-place-to-hide?currentPage=1">published a lengthy interview</a> with Greenwald about the book, the Snowden documents, and his background.</p>
<p>Snowden himself also made some public statements this week, in the form of a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/edward-snowdens-motive-revealed-he-can-sleep-night-n116851">lengthy interview with NBC News</a>. In it, he denied any relationship with or support from the Russian government and lamented that he was &#8220;stuck&#8221; in a place with so little protection for the individual rights he champions. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/us/politics/snowden-says-he-was-a-spy-not-just-an-analyst.html">had a good summary</a> of the interview&#8217;s particularly noteworthy elements, as well as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/business/media/to-get-snowden-interview-nbc-news-relied-on-secrecy.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0">story of how NBC News got a sit-down with Snowden</a>.</p>
<p><strong>—</strong></p>
<p><strong>New numbers on the state of the Internet</strong>: Legendary Internet analyst and venture capitalist Mary Meeker <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends">released her annual slides</a> on the state of the Internet this week, which, as The Lab&#8217;s Joshua Benton <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-scariest-chart-in-mary-meekers-slide-deck-for-newspapers-has-gotten-a-little-scarier/">noted</a>, is a very useful set of hard numbers to pin down our sense of how the Internet is changing and where it&#8217;s headed. The trend that got the most attention was the acceleration of mobile use: As <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2014/05/28/no-surprise-but-mobile-rules-in-mary-meekers-annual-guide-to-internet-trends/">Robert Hof</a> of Forbes and Recode&#8217;s <a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/28/meeker-as-internet-user-growth-slows-the-real-driver-is-mobile-usage/">Liz Gannes</a> highlighted, the growth of Internet use is slowing, while smartphone use is up more than 20% annually around the world and mobile traffic is up 81% thanks largely to video.</p>
<p>Forbes&#8217; Jeff Bercovici also <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/05/28/the-most-important-technology-trend-of-2014-according-to-mary-meeker/">pointed out the increase</a> in sensors and other wearable or mobile systems that are measuring mountains of user data, only a very small portion of which is being analyzed. On the financial side, Meeker <a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/28/kleiners-meeker-tamps-down-all-that-bubble-talk/">presented some numbers</a> suggesting that tech&#8217;s role in the market isn&#8217;t approaching the bubbly levels of the dotcom bust era, as Recode&#8217;s James Temple noted, though Fortune&#8217;s Dan Primack <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/05/28/mary-meekers-missing-vc-math/">argued</a> that Meeker was selectively omitting data indicating abnormally high VC valuations of tech companies.</p>
<p>For those in traditional journalism, Benton <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-scariest-chart-in-mary-meekers-slide-deck-for-newspapers-has-gotten-a-little-scarier/">broke down</a> what he called the scariest chart in Meeker&#8217;s slide deck, which shows that despite the decline in print advertising, it still far outstrips the attention paid to print, which continues to drop every year. Benton noted that while one could argue that print may be a medium distinctly suited for advertising, <strong>newspapers need to reckon with the fact that &#8220;Print advertising is not coming back. It will fall further. <em>Substantially </em>further.&#8221; On the flip side, he said, &#8220;mobile is eating the world, and most news organizations make only a pittance off it.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reading roundup</strong>: A few more things to check out as this relatively slow week comes to a close:</p>
<p>— On the New York Times and diversity front: The Pew Research Center&#8217;s Monica Anderson <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/28/as-the-new-york-times-first-black-executive-editor-dean-baquet-is-in-a-distinct-minority/">noted</a> that new Times executive editor Dean Baquet is part of a small minority of racial and ethnic minorities in American newspapers. The New Yorker&#8217;s Ken Auletta gave <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2014/05/summing-up-the-firing-of-jill-abramson.html?currentPage=all">yet another report</a> on the circumstances behind the firing of his predecessor, Jill Abramson, and at The Washington Post, journalism professor Nikki Usher <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/05/28/its-not-just-jill-abramson-women-everywhere-are-getting-pushed-out-of-journalism/">argued</a> that beyond Abramson, women are being marginalized in journalism, especially the more tech-centric parts of it. Former Digital First journalist Mandy Jenkins <a href="http://zombiejournalism.com/2014/05/technology-is-a-solution-not-a-problem-for-women-in-newsrooms/">countered</a> that tech is an asset, not an obstacle, for women to gain larger roles in newsrooms.</p>
<p>— On the New York Times and innovation front: In Politico magazine, David Warsh <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/the-new-york-times-innovation-report-is-a-disaster-107041.html#.U4TRgvldUkL">criticized</a> The Times&#8217; <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/224332847/NYT-Innovation-Report-2014">recently released Innovation Report</a> as short-sighted, while French media executive Frédéric Filloux <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/05/25/the-new-york-times-kpis/">praised the paper&#8217;s digital adaptation</a> and said it could conceivably even drop print and survive financially. And here at the Lab, Times news analytics director James Robinson <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/watching-the-audience-move-a-new-york-times-tool-is-helping-direct-traffic-from-story-to-story/">explained a tool</a> The Times is using to track the flow of traffic and audience attention across the site.</p>
<p>— The New York Times&#8217; David Carr <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/business/media/a-platform-and-blogging-tool-medium-charms-writers.html">profiled Medium</a>, the publisher-as-platform run by Evan Williams of Blogger and Twitter fame. Ricardo Bilton of Digiday <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/medium-goes-vertical-latest-editorial-pitch/">looked into its prospects</a> for bringing in revenue as well.</p>
<p>— Finally, the Columbia Journalism Review&#8217;s Ryan Chittum <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/newspaper_subscription_revenue.php?page=all">analyzed some historical newspaper data</a> to make the case that newspapers have been relying on inflated advertising revenue and must extract more revenue from their readers as they did before about 1980.</p>
