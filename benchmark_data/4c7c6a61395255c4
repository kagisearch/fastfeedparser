										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> is the talk of the Internet, and for good reason. It&#8217;s a great product, carefully designed, well implemented, with some fascinating architecture choices. It&#8217;s basically an early Twitter clone with some important new features, like custom feeds and labelers that anyone can make.</p>



<p>Bluesky is built on the open <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT protocol</a>, so users have a &#8220;credible exit,&#8221; meaning if Bluesky the company goes belly up or evil, users should still control their data and be able to &#8220;exit&#8221; to another app.</p>



<p>There are some great discussions about the exact nature of decentralized social networks, notably:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Christine Lemmer-Webber&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/">How decentralized is Bluesky really?</a>&#8220;</li>



<li>and Bryan Newbold&#8217;s <a href="https://whtwnd.com/bnewbold.net/3lbvbtqrg5t2t">response</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, I think the interesting and very tricky question is: <strong>who owns the graph?</strong></p>



<p>Because of course it&#8217;s not just perfectly insulated silos of Alice data and Bob data. The whole point is that Alice might follow Bob, and Bob might quote Alice, and Carol might respond to Bob, and David might block Carol. It&#8217;s clear who owns the nodes of the graph. But who owns those edges, those connections, between the nodes? Who decides who can quote-tweet and who can reply?</p>



<p>In a centralized setup like Twitter, the graph is owned and fully controlled by Twitter, of course. And their complete ownership of the graph means they can make subtle decisions about what permission you need for various kinds of cross-user interactions. For example, Twitter decides what exactly happens when Bob blocks Alice, in particular it means that (a) Alice doesn&#8217;t get notified, and (b) Alice no longer follows Bob. It leads to interesting emergent features like the &#8220;soft block,&#8221; where Bob blocks and then immediately unblocks Alice, which has the effect of Alice no longer following Bob and likely not noticing, a useful maneuver to quietly stop mild harassment.</p>



<p>So in a decentralized world where Alice owns her data and Bob owns his data, who owns the follows, the blocks, the quotes, the responses, etc? Is it entirely up to Alice who she follows? Or do the followees have a say? And what does that all even mean if everyone&#8217;s data is public anyways?</p>



<p>This is the challenge of decentralized solutions, and it&#8217;s a hard challenge because, once you decide on ownership structure of the graph, it&#8217;s really hard to change things. Twitter can (and did) unilaterally decide that likes should become private this year. Mastodon and Bluesky could never do that overnight. So these decisions have to be made explicitly, and they matter a lot.</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re <strong>really not obvious!</strong></p>



<p>So far, on Mastodon / ActivityPub, a follow relationship requires bilateral consent. By default, consent is automatically granted by the person being followed, but any user could easily decide <strong><em>not</em></strong> to approve every follow. Now technically, access to the content is almost never tightly controlled by users. But compliant implementations of the ActivityPub protocol will not get notified of new posts from Alice and will not scrape them – and that latter part is really just a norm.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, on Bluesky / AT, a follow relationship is entirely owned by the follower. Alice decides to follow Bob, and Bob has no say, because Bob&#8217;s data is entirely public, and Alice choosing to follow Bob just means that Alice&#8217;s app regularly checks Bob&#8217;s public content (technically through a relay and an app view but that doesn&#8217;t matter for this discussion.)</p>



<p>You might find Bluesky&#8217;s decision weird, but it&#8217;s entirely consistent with the Open Web – for example, on the Web, you don&#8217;t get to decide who links to your web page. You can password protect it, but if it&#8217;s public, incoming links to you are owned by the pages where they live, not by you.</p>



<p>Who&#8217;s right? I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a right answer. My preference is the Open Web approach, simply because I think it matches the reality of what having public content means – but of course I understand folks who disagree.</p>



<p>So now we come to blocks. Those are much, much harder. Surely if Bob blocks Alice, Bob owns that block but&#8230; what does it mean in a world where Bob&#8217;s content is public? A block depends on all implementations being conformant with the block specification.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Different views of the graph</h3>



<p>What&#8217;s going to be particularly interesting over time is whether different views of the graph emerge with competing implementations, and what those competing implementations will do if they strongly disagree with the other&#8217;s choices. There are, of course, already different views of the data <em>within</em> the realm of the protocol – block lists, custom feeds, etc. all contribute to different people having different different views of the data. But different views of the <em>graph,</em> that&#8217;s something else altogether.</p>



<p>You can imagine, for example, a Redsky app that uses the existing Bluesky network and ignores all blocks. Folks using the Bluesky app would not notice this. But there would exist an extra layer of interactions for people using the Redsky app, where abusers can quote-tweet their targets to their heart&#8217;s content, and everyone on Redsky can see it even if others on Bluesky can&#8217;t. What happens in that case? Does the Bluesky app start not just ignoring non-compliant content, but also banning accounts that have non-compliant content? Do Redsky datastores start delivering different content to Bluesky relays so they don&#8217;t get detected as non-compliant?</p>



<p>All of this can also technically be done on Mastodon, with non-compliant, scraping implementations of ActivityPub nodes. This can&#8217;t technically be stopped unless users go fully private.</p>



<p>Will this be stopped at the norm / Terms Of Service level? I&#8217;m dubious they will.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know where this all goes. But I do think it&#8217;s fascinating and interesting and far from obvious. The subtlety of how we want to represent human relationships is actually a lot easier when one organization fully controls the graph and can evolve its model based on evolving threats and norms. It&#8217;s dramatically more complicated when the graph is diffuse, owned by no single entity, and ultimately written down as a protocol. Protocol decisions will matter a ton. And folks will get around the protocol, too, especially when content is effectively public.</p>



<p>Maybe this is just the messiness of human relationships, in protocol form.</p>

<p>We are well into the era of highly believable fake photos and videos. The major crises of disinformation that these fake photos will enable are still ahead of us, and they could be very damaging.</p>



<p>Swift (or Mark Twain?) was right: a lie travels halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. We have to slow down the uptake of fake media at the point of spread. Imagine the impact of a convincing but fake photo of a Presidential candidate in a compromising situation, released just a few days before the election? There won&#8217;t be enough time to debunk it and undo even a fraction of the damage.</p>



<p>We have to move to affirmative sourcing of online media, so that individuals can have confidence in the source of an image, and hopefully become dubious of images without a confirmed source. <a href="https://c2pa.org">C2PA</a> is the way to do that, and it seems to have momentum.</p>



<p>Adobe markets this as <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials</a>, and Microsoft as <a href="https://contentintegrity.microsoft.com/">Content Integrity</a>. And they really need to settle on one name, come on people!</p>



<p>LinkedIn is surfacing some of this metadata. Meta, too. It&#8217;s not good enough yet, but it&#8217;s getting there.</p>



<p>Browsers need to get in the game, flagging content as you navigate the Web.</p>



<p>And phones need to do it too, when creating content. We have the technology to tag real photos and videos as &#8220;produced by iPhones&#8221; in a way that would be very hard to fake. And it could be done in a privacy protecting way that doesn&#8217;t link different photos to the same device. Come on Apple, you&#8217;ve got the tech chops by a mile. Let&#8217;s do this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;re watching US Open tennis, you&#8217;ll notice that there are no line judges anymore. Almost every officiating call is made by the <a href="https://www.hawkeyeinnovations.com/">Hawk-Eye</a> system. It&#8217;s used in a number of other sports, too, but let&#8217;s focus on tennis.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a really good reason for using Hawk-Eye: human line judges make mistakes. Big mistakes. Sometimes mistakes that seem particularly biased against certain players. In a 2004 match, <a href="https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/11/11/history-of-hawk-eye-tennis-umpiring">multiple egregiously bad calls</a> were made against Serena Williams. Viewers at home who saw the slow-motion replay could easily see how wrong the calls were, and it wasn&#8217;t close. John &#8220;you cannot be serious&#8221; McEnroe called for Hawk-Eye on the spot, during the broadcast. </p>



<p>Initially, Hawk-Eye was used as a backup – a player could challenge a human call and have Hawk-Eye overturn it. Today, at the US Open, Hawk-Eye makes all the decisions, and players cannot appeal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png"><img width="398" height="250" data-attachment-id="3757" data-permalink="https://benlog.com/2024/09/04/tennis-and-democracy/image/" data-orig-file="https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" data-orig-size="398,250" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png?w=398" src="https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png?w=398" alt="" class="wp-image-3757" style="width:649px;height:auto" srcset="https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png 398w, https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png?w=150 150w, https://benlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></a></figure>



<p>But here&#8217;s the thing – are we sure that Hawk-Eye always gets it right? In general, when you average out all the calls, Hawk-Eye is, without a doubt, better than a human line judge making a split-second decision. But can it make mistakes?</p>



<p>Of course Hawk-Eye can make mistakes. It&#8217;s a computerized system with bugs, like any computerized system, and it can fail in small and large ways. There was a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/tennis/tennis-star-falls-victim-to-hawkeye-error-as-miami-open-apology-demanded/ar-BB1kzpD4">clear malfunction in Miami 5 months ago</a> where the Hawk-Eye rendering showed an improbable ball angle and likely incorrect call, which almost certainly affected the outcome of the match.</p>



<p>Most importantly, like any computerized system making a judgment call on physical evidence, Hawk-Eye needs calibration to know where the lines are. And that calibration is, of course, done by humans, and could be wrong, or the calibration could drift after a few matches.</p>



<p>So how do we fix this? Do we get rid of Hawk-Eye? That doesn&#8217;t seem helpful, since we know that human line judges make so many mistakes. Do we go back to human line judges with occasional challenges adjudicated by Hawk-Eye? Maybe. But that gets things backwards, since we know that Hawk-Eye is going to get it right 99.99% of the time, and humans simply can&#8217;t match that.</p>



<p>Instead, how about we learn from American voting machines? American voting machines read more than 150 million balllots per election. They get things right almost all the time. And they certainly do a heck of a lot better than humans counting votes. But sometimes, they can get things wrong. Maybe a mis-calibration. Maybe some dust obstructs the ballot scanner.</p>



<p>Many states in the US check their voting machines by running statistical post-election audits – a sample of paper ballots is selected and those ballots are verified, slowly and by hand, against their machine interpretation. Too many discrepancies, and we escalate to looking at more ballots, just in case a machine error might have affected the outcome. This is very rare – the machines almost always get it right. But on that rare occasion where they get it wrong, having an escalation path is critical.</p>



<p>This is the right man/machine collaboration – use machines to make a lot of decisions very quickly, and escalate to humans for a small sample where you can take your time to review every angle.</p>



<p>We should apply the same idea to line judges at the US Open. Use Hawk-Eye to make initial decisions, but give the chair umpire and possibly the players the right to challenge the call, which then brings up the original video stream of the shot, not interpreted by Hawk-Eye, leaving it to be reviewed by the chair umpire.</p>



<p>Just like voting machines + post-election human audits are the best of both worlds, Hawk-Eye + challenges &amp; human override can help make US open calls much more consistent and fair while also controlling for the rare case where a malfunction of the technology should yield to a slow human review.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#8217;s what I would like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Discuss with my kids an appropriate budget of device usage. Maybe 1h a night on weekdays, and 3h a day on weekends.</li>



<li>Have that budget apply automatically across all of their devices. iPad, iPhone, Windows, Mac, Playstation, etc.</li>



<li>When they reach their budget, they can request a short extension, say 5min. Maybe this is a conversation, maybe this is a notification on my phone. Either way, I can approve it trivially.</li>



<li>Based on various conditions and conversations with my kids, I can easily lower or increase their budget for the day, from my phone.</li>



<li>We all get reports on usage of various devices and apps, trends, and we can look at it together, think about the time we&#8217;re spending on screens as a family, and be more deliberate about that time.</li>



<li>Maybe in v2, more complex budgets, like laptop can be free-for-all at school during the school hours, without taking away from evening budget.</li>



<li>Maybe in v3, we can get into specifics of what kind of apps have what budgets. Maybe. But maybe diminishing returns at this point.</li>



<li>Of course this has to work whether devices are connected via wifi or cell or whatever.</li>
</ul>



<p>There is no way to do this today. Even if you&#8217;re exclusively on Apple, there&#8217;s nothing close to this. Apple&#8217;s current parental controls are poor, although to their credit they&#8217;re better than the rest. That&#8217;s a roundabout way of saying that all of it sucks.</p>



<p>If I wanted to implement this in my copious free time, I don&#8217;t see any way to do it without dramatically intrusive client-side software, and even then I can&#8217;t control actually locking out a device when a screen budget has expired, especially on iOS.</p>



<p>Now, I just described what *I* want. Other parents may want something different. But the bottom line is, parents want and need more control. Ideally that control is wielded after open conversations with their kids. Ideally that control is wielded without super intrusive content filters and monitoring. But you know, *some* control that allows parents to spend less time fighting about screens.</p>



<p>This can&#8217;t happen without the platform makers agreeing on a Parental Control Protocol. That protocol would then allow parental control apps to emerge and offer different styles of parental control. The screentime-budget-app is one I&#8217;d gladly build. Other folks could build other apps with a different philosophy. Enrolling devices should be easy. OS-level support on those devices is required. Transparency to the user should be part of it, so a device displays that it&#8217;s enrolled in a parental-control system.</p>



<p>Maybe we need an industry consortium. Maybe we need some regulation once we have a reasonable protocol that all major platforms can adopt. But the status quo seems woefully inadequate, and given how modern platforms limit what app developers can do, this cannot be fixed without actual collaboration between the platform vendors.</p>



<p>I hope this happens.</p>

<div class="embed-youtube"><iframe title="USENIX Security &#039;20 - Panel: The 2020 Election: Remote Voting, Disinformation, and Audit" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGBJ81Z1c1g?start=956&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>When you see a perplexing claim in a field that is not of your expertise – which is most of the time – you&#8217;re likely wrong if you blame malice or stupidity. Chances are, you don&#8217;t understand the problem.</p>



<p><em>Why don&#8217;t we just make election day a holiday? Why don&#8217;t we just count ballots by hand? Why can&#8217;t we just vote online?</em> <em>Why do we need QR codes on ballots?</em> I can give you the detailed and nuanced answer to these questions, and yet many will assume malice or incompetence. I get why they&#8217;re asking and I understand why they assume malice or stupidity. They&#8217;re wrong, but I get it.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m working to make sure that when I think about other domains where I&#8217;m not an expert, I don&#8217;t jump to conclusions of malice or stupidity. For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I&#8217;d really like to see fewer innocent people shot by police. The incidents we keep hearing in the news are deeply disturbing to me. But&#8230; I don&#8217;t know the first thing about policing.<br></li>



<li>I&#8217;d really like to see affordable quality healthcare for everyone. The private medical insurance system appears badly broken to me. But&#8230; I&#8217;m not a health policy expert.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The value of amateurs</h3>



<p>On the flip side, experts are too quick to dismiss the perspective of amateurs. If you&#8217;re an elections expert and someone asks you the same &#8220;dumb&#8221; question for the 100th time, it&#8217;s easy to dismiss it. But there is great value that comes from asking basic questions without the burden of expertise. Expertise can prevent you from seeing the big picture. Expertise can constrain your thinking. Expertise can make you miss the whole point.</p>



<p>While the amateurs asking the questions may be asking for moonshots without any sense of what it takes to get there, asking for something without the burden of how to get there is still very important. It is the experts&#8217; jobs to solve for those outcomes, even if their expertise blinds them to the possibility at first.</p>



<p>To continue to pick on the examples where I&#8217;m not an expert:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I want a world where innocent people don&#8217;t get shot. We should all want that. I&#8217;m sure that when you consider the expert details of policing, it&#8217;s a lot harder than it sounds. So I&#8217;m going to assume folks working on this are neither malicious nor stupid, but I don&#8217;t accept that we can&#8217;t make progress on it. I want policing experts working on this.<br></li>



<li>I want a world where a medical emergency doesn&#8217;t cause bankruptcy. No doubt this is hard, especially given our starting point in the US. I&#8217;m going to forgo assumptions of malice or stupidity, but I don&#8217;t accept that we can&#8217;t solve this problem.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Amateurs Ask, Experts Answer</h3>



<p>I want a world where amateurs ask and experts answer.</p>



<p>Amateurs bring tremendous value by focusing on a desired outcome. Experts bring tremendous value in determining what&#8217;s possible and blazing a path towards those outcomes.</p>



<p>We need humility on both sides. Amateurs must accept that their simplified view of a particular domain is often fundamentally wrong, and so getting to a desired outcome is often much harder than it seems, maybe sometimes impossible. Experts must accept that their detailed knowledge can blind them as to the desirable societal outcome.</p>



<p>And of course, even the world&#8217;s greatest expert in one topic is an amateur in hundreds of others. Experts often forget this. Expertise is not an easily transferable skill.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t attribute to stupidity what can easily be explained by you not understanding the problem. And don&#8217;t dismiss the wishes of those who don&#8217;t understand the problem.</p>



<p>We need experts <em>and</em> amateurs.</p>

<p>When I was VP Engineering at <a href="https://clever.com">Clever</a>, I defined an incident response approach that I called The Flare Process. A few years later, with the added benefit of hindsight, here&#8217;s my description of the process. It goes without saying that you should shamelessly steal / copy / modify this process for your own use, including its name, if you&#8217;d like.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is Incident Response?</h3>



<p>Incident response is what your organization does when a problem requires rapid and well-coordinated actions. This is optimized for something like a web site outage, but could be used for any other incident response, including for example an unexpected bad press article. Incident response is about fighting a fire: it should be limited in time and look a good bit different from day-to-day work. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Only Medium-Sized Organizations?</h3>



<p>The Flare Process is good for medium-sized organizations, maybe 15-500 people. It&#8217;s probably not necessary for fewer people, where a fire usually involves everyone anyways. It probably needs significant adjustments for larger groups, where determining who knows what is an order of magnitude more complicated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Goals</h3>



<p>We want the problem mitigated as quickly as possible. We also want internal and external stakeholders to know what&#8217;s going on at any given time. Finally, we want to learn all meaningful lessons from the incident.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rapid Mitigation</h3>



<p>There are many ways to fail at mitigating the problem quickly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>reacting too slowly because the problem may not be visible to the right person right away.</li>



<li>not coordinating the response well: no chefs, too many chefs.</li>



<li>making the problem worse with good intentions: too many people doing uncoordinated things.</li>



<li>making the problem worse with risky solutions: surprisingly often, the response makes the problem worse.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Flare Process solves this as follows:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>allow anyone in the org to &#8220;fire a flare&#8221;</li>



<li>the motto is &#8220;when in doubt, fire a flare&#8221;</li>



<li>if a flare turns out to be nothing, that&#8217;s okay.</li>



<li>immediately establish an incident lead</li>



<li>immediately establish an incident room, physical or virtual, as well as an incident communication channel, e.g. a Slack channel.</li>



<li>shift to strict command-and-control: incident lead pulls in anyone needed, everyone follows direction from the incident lead, and no action is taken without explicit go-ahead from incident lead.</li>



<li>have a handy list of safe actions to try for rapid mitigation – for software systems this is usually scale up service, restart service, etc. Again, only the incident lead can decide that any of these or other actions should be taken.</li>



<li>the incident lead directs all necessary work until the flare is mitigated, and only the incident lead can declare the flare mitigated.</li>



<li>the incident lead is explicitly not trying to perform a full root causes analysis or find the perfect fix to the problem. Their goal is to mitigate quickly. That might involve over-provisioning a service that&#8217;s overwhelmed even though it&#8217;s not clear why it&#8217;s overwhelmed in the moment. The goal is rapid mitigation. Full root causes analysis comes later.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Good Communication</h3>



<p>Sometimes a problem is being solved in the most expert way, but the response is still a failure, because internal stakeholders, usually the customer support team, the CEO, etc. have no idea what&#8217;s going on, how long the problem will take to resolve, the extent of the problem, etc. Same for external stakeholders.</p>



<p>The Flare Process solves this as follows:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>every flare is assigned a comms lead</li>



<li>the comms lead summarizes the situation to the full org internally as it evolves, including as soon as there is some sense of the issue, and then regularly, no less often than every 30-60 minutes.</li>



<li>ideally the comms lead is capable of gathering all the information they need for these status updates, with as little help as possible from the incident lead so as not to slow down the actual response.</li>



<li>the comms lead is also responsible for coordinating any external communication as needed – updating a status page, communicating proactively to customers in other ways, etc.</li>



<li>any inbound question from within or outside the org goes to the comms lead.</li>
</ol>



<p>The core idea is that the incident lead is NOT responsible for communications. They&#8217;re focused on problem solving.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Learning</h3>



<p>The worst outcome of any incident is that no lessons are learned and the problem recurs.</p>



<p>The Flare Process solves this as follows:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>all participants in the Flare are encouraged to post information they find as they find it in the shared channel, including screenshots of errors, metrics, graphs, user error reports, new developments of any kind.  This creates a timestamped record of all information for later analysis.</li>



<li>a flare is mitigated once the problem is no longer active, but is only resolved once appropriate followup actions have been defined.</li>



<li>on a regular basis (weekly, biweekly, monthly), all mitigated Flares are reviewed in a synchronous meeting by a few experienced folks, with each Flare yielding either no action, some quick action, or a referral to a full postmortem. Some would argue every Flare deserves a full postmortem – if you are able to build a system where Flares are rare enough for that to be possible, more power to you! Be careful, though, that this doesn&#8217;t create an incentive to not fire a flare due to followup work.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tooling</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s good to automate things. At Clever, we built <a href="https://github.com/Clever/flarebot">Flarebot</a>, a simple Slack bot that automates a few aspects of running a Flare, specifically:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>letting anyone fire a flare</li>



<li>automatically creating the Flare-specific slack channel and JIRA ticket for tracking the flare status with appropriate priority.</li>



<li>prompting for the declaration of an incident lead and a comms lead</li>



<li>reminding everyone that the incident lead is the boss – it&#8217;s easier to hear this from a bot!</li>



<li>reminding the incident lead of the simple immediate actions to consider – it&#8217;s easier to hear this from a bot!</li>



<li>providing a simple mechanism to declare the flare mitigated.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An Example</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s a realistic example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Joe on the support team is seeing some occasional error pages on the login form and is hearing the same from one customer. He asks his colleagues and most of them don&#8217;t see it, but one colleague says &#8220;yeah, I think I&#8217;m seeing the same thing.&#8221;</li>



<li>Joe&#8217;s not perfectly sure but, &#8220;when in doubt, fire a flare&#8221;, so he heads to #flares in company Slack and writes<br>&#8220;@flarebot fire a flare p2 sporadic error pages on login form&#8221;.</li>



<li>Flarebot automatically creates a JIRA ticket, #43, and creates the associated Slack channel #flare-43</li>



<li>Flarebot posts in the #flares channel that the Flare has been fired, and links everyone to the #flare-43 channel</li>



<li>Engineers have notifications turned on for the #flares channel (and this can be linked into oncall, of course)</li>



<li>A few engineers quickly post graphs from the metrics system in the #flare-43 channel showing elevated error rates.</li>



<li>Flarebot reminds everyone that an incident lead is needed. If no one steps up after a couple of minutes, Flarebot asks again.</li>



<li>A few experienced engineers quickly discuss in channel who should lead, and Mary steps up. She writes in the Flare channel &#8220;@flarebot I am incident lead&#8221;</li>



<li>Flarebot acknowledges Mary and instructs everyone to follow Mary&#8217;s lead.</li>



<li>At this point, with a team experienced in the Flare Process, we&#8217;re ideally only 2-4 minutes from the Flare having been fired.</li>



<li>Mary reviews the data from engineers and confirms the issue is real, which means we need comms. </li>



<li>Josh, product manager of the login system, declares himself comms lead and tells Flarebot. Josh summarizes the issue for the company in the #flares channel – anyone can join the flare-43-specific channel if they want to, but they don&#8217;t have to – Josh will update them in #flares at a regular clip.</li>



<li>At this point, we have an incident lead, a comms lead, an active investigation.</li>



<li>Mary brings in and directs engineering resources as she sees fit. She may ask people to join her in a physical or Zoom room. She&#8217;s asking engineers to go look at data and bring it to her.</li>



<li>One engineer is convinced they know what&#8217;s going on, that the DA service needs to be restarted. He posts in the channel &#8220;I&#8217;d like to restart the DA service.&#8221; Mary responds &#8220;that&#8217;s safe to try and likely relevant, please do it.&#8221; The engineer follows through only upon hearing this confirmation from Mary.</li>



<li>The restart appears to resolve the issue. Mary instructs everyone to pause all actions and report on metrics. </li>



<li>A couple of minutes later, the errors have disappeared. Josh updates the company that the issue may be mitigated, the team is watching.</li>



<li>A few more minutes of stability, Mary declares the flare mitigated<br>&#8220;@flarebot flare is mitigated&#8221;</li>



<li>Flarebot updates the JIRA ticket accordingly and does a little celebratory dance in the Slack channel, as well as the main #flares channel.</li>



<li>Josh adds any relevant details for all-team comms.</li>



<li>Over the next couple of days, Mary collects more data and writes up a simple report on the Flare in the JIRA ticket.</li>



<li>Later that week, Andrea the engineering director runs the weekly Flare wrap-up meeting and brings in Mary for 5 minutes to hear about Flare 43. Mary explains that a few badly timed failures in AWS caused unexpected load on the DA service, and the restart naturally selected new AWS VMs, resolving the problem. While this was an infrastructural problem not caused by the company&#8217;s own systems, Andrea decides that the team needs to better detect these issues automatically in the future. She creates a followup ticket for the infrastructure team. Andrea marks the flare &#8220;resolved&#8221;, deciding no further postmortem is needed.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A few more points</h3>



<p>Decision-making in a Flare situation has to be dramatically faster and opinionated than in a typical non-emergency situation. The incident lead must be assertive. Everyone else must follow their lead, even if they disagree – they should voice their concerns of course, in case the incident lead is missing something, but that concern, once expressed and overridden, must be cast aside. This can be difficult for an organization to adapt to, so it should be practiced. And when the Flare is mitigated and it&#8217;s time for learning, the discussion must return to a more typical collaborative tone.</p>



<p>The determination of the incident lead might be tricky if there are a lot of Flares and engineers are tired. This is something engineering leadership should keep an eye on. If engineers self-select to be incident leads, and it&#8217;s not always the same ones, and it doesn&#8217;t feel too burdensome, then great. If not, worth understanding what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p>&#8220;When in doubt fire a flare&#8221; is critical. If team members, especially support team members who may be relatively new, don&#8217;t feel comfortable firing flares, if they&#8217;re not celebrated for it, they won&#8217;t do it. And that can cause very painful delays, turning a minor Flare into a major one.</p>



<p>On the flip side, a Flare process layered on top of an unreliable flimsy system is going to cause havoc. If your system is too unreliable, fix that first. You can&#8217;t be constantly in firefighting mode.</p>



<p>In the description above, a priority for the Flare is declared right away (P2). For this to be feasible, your whole organization needs a clear agreement on what the priorities mean in such a way that this can be determined at the onset. For example, P2 might mean small customer impact, P1 might mean large customer impact, and P0 might mean existential threat to the whole organization. If it&#8217;s hard to align on those, you may want to leave out a priority at the start.</p>



<p>At Clever, we also found it useful to have preemptive flares, and to have Flarebot support those. You could say &#8220;fire a preemptive flare p2 service degradation in X, Y, Z may lead to partial downtime in a few hours,&#8221; and the same process happens except Flarebot is there to remind everyone that there&#8217;s no customer impact yet, so everybody chill. Also, no need for a comms lead in the case of a preemptive Flare.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bottom Line</h3>



<p>In order to respond to incidents effectively, you need a clear, simple process that prioritizes mitigation, communication, and learning. Automation can be super helpful here. And making sure everyone understands they&#8217;re all on the same team is critical. Think carefully through the incentives you create when setting up such a process. The process above has worked well for me. Hopefully it can work for you, too.</p>

<p>The always awesome and insightful Luis wrote a post 9 years ago about how <a href="https://lu.is/blog/2013/04/21/why-feed-reading-is-an-open-web-problem-and-what-browsers-could-do-about-it/">the web browser should become an RSS reader</a>. Super important set of ideas and right on.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mozilla has announced their intent to join the Fediverse by <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launch-fediverse-instance-social-media-alternative/">standing up a Mastodon instance in early 2023</a>.</p>



<p>I think Mozilla should make Firefox into an awesome Fediverse client soon, right when a large group of early-adopter-type users are looking for something to replace Twitter. In fact, Mozilla could single handedly solve many of the issues I wrote about in <a href="https://benlog.com/2022/12/28/dont-let-federation-make-the-experience-suck/">Don’t let federation make the experience suck</a>. Mozilla should also stand up a Mastodon / other ActivityPub server instance to provide a full stack, but the client is the more critical work.</p>



<p>Imagine.</p>



<p>You open up Firefox and you&#8217;re prompted to join the Fediverse (someone find a new name for this) by creating a Firefox account, publishing as @username@firefox.com. Click, click done. Maybe there&#8217;s a fee. It&#8217;s ok to pay for things.</p>



<p>Of course if you already have a Fediverse account on another server, you can link it to your Firefox in seconds. And if you need a new Fediverse account but not on the Firefox instance, you can set that up, too. It&#8217;s just that there&#8217;s an easy default and most users don&#8217;t need to immediately learn the difference between servers and clients.</p>



<p>Anywhere on the web as you surf, you can share the current page with your followers via your Fediverse account. The share button is built into the browser. If the people you follow have already commented about this page you&#8217;re viewing, your browser will tell you, in context.</p>



<p>When you find a person or a company or a club&#8217;s Fediverse page as you surf the Web, whether it&#8217;s on your server instance or not, you can tell right away if you already follow them, or you can follow them in one click, right in your browser. No copy/paste obstacles.</p>



<p>And of course if you click a link from a fediverse post, Firefox can navigate you there, never leaving Firefox, keeping the context of the post from which you came. And of course you&#8217;ve got your cookies if you&#8217;re sent to a paywalled article where you have a subscription, because you&#8217;re in your web browser the whole time.</p>



<p>Go further.</p>



<p>As you browse the web, Firefox is proactively telling you about people who seem to share a lot of the links you happen to read. Maybe you should follow those people for other cool things. All privacy protecting since your browsing activity is private while the links from other folks are explicitly public.</p>



<p>Firefox + ActivityPub + this weird moment in time where many people are actively looking for a Twitter alternative&#8230; Could be how we make the Web actually more social in a healthy way.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s more still.</p>



<p>Have you heard from less-tech savvy friends &#8220;what is this Mastodon thing and how do I try it out?&#8221; And have you been hesitant because you don&#8217;t want to say &#8220;first you have to pick a server&#8221; and then watch their eyes glaze over before you&#8217;ve even had a chance to tell them that they have to also pick a native mobile app?</p>



<p>What if you just told them: download Firefox on Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, whatever,  click the Fediverse icon, and follow the instructions. And then you can send them links to people they should follow. And they just work.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s so much more. Firefox, with executable code running on desktops and laptops and mobile devices, could fairly easily add e2e encrypted direct messages.</p>



<p>Mozilla has been looking to make the Web more social in a healthy way for at least 10 years. This might be it. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m pessimistic about federated architectures for new end-user products, like Mastodon. But, I could be wrong. In fact, I&#8217;d love to be wrong on this one. So since Blaine fairly called me out for implying that the fediverse can&#8217;t be better than Twitter, I&#8217;m gonna try to help, at least at first by pushing on all the UX aspects of Mastodon/ActivityPub that I think should be addressed.</p>



<p>Some will say that waxing poetic about software architecture is not as helpful as getting into the code and helping. There&#8217;s truth to that. That said, my strong sense is that we&#8217;re currently papering over major UX problems that are linked to core architectural properties. We&#8217;re papering over these issues out of excitement over growing adoption. I think that could limit the fediverse to a small community. So, some architectural and product analysis might be helpful.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&#8217;s Law</a> is sometimes referred to as &#8220;shipping your org chart&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve been in professional software development for a while, you&#8217;ve likely come to respect its power and inevitability. How your team is structured is always visible in the product you produce, and that can often be a bad thing for users. It&#8217;s the weird cracks of inconsistency and disconnectedness within a user application that makes you wonder if two parts of the app were made by two different companies.</p>



<p>Conway&#8217;s Law doesn&#8217;t only apply to software, but it seems to be particularly relevant in the software realm, probably because software is always changing, thereby revealing the organizational fault lines more regularly. Martin Fowler has <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html">a great analysis</a> of Conway&#8217;s Law applied to software. The bottom line is that team organization affects software architecture deeply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conway&#8217;s Corollary</h2>



<p>If Conway&#8217;s Law tells us that team org deeply affects a product and its architecture, let&#8217;s define Conway&#8217;s Corollary: software architecture deeply affects the product. Large product changes at scale often require large architectural changes. This might sound obvious, but we seem to be ignoring it in the fediverse.</p>



<p>What happens when key aspects of software architecture are immovable, or at least shockingly expensive to change? Like, say, in the fediverse, where users are signed up to different servers and the protocol between those servers is going to evolve very slowly at best?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UX to Fix</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Usernames and Server Choice</h3>



<p>An example of federation with good UX is cell phone networks. No one has to know that I&#8217;m on Google Fi or T-Mobile. I can change networks and you still don&#8217;t need to know. SMS messages are delivered and phone calls are connected without a hitch.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t always this way. Cell phone networks used to not have number portability. You had to change numbers if you changed networks. If you never experienced this sad state of affairs, say if you only got a cell phone in 2004 or later, you might find this laughably outrageous. It was.</p>



<p>The state of Mastodon account management is in just as outrageous a stage as cell phones before number portability, and we&#8217;re making excuses for this. The cell phone networks made excuses, too. It&#8217;s hard, technically. Yes. And then they fixed it.</p>



<p>Users should be able to pick a username and then stick with it even if they change Mastodon provider. Other users shouldn&#8217;t need to know their Mastodon provider. No username should need to change.</p>



<p>I know, the specs don&#8217;t support this. They need to. Maybe that means getting rid of email-address-like usernames and having one global namespace. Maybe that&#8217;s an indirection overlay on top of existing identifiers, and those identifiers are not directly surfaced, like DNS over IP addresses. Lots of ways to think about this. But we have to start with the acknowledgement that tying provider choice to username is bad and cannot last.</p>



<p>Heck, this situation is bad even from a strongly pro-federation perspective. One key goal of federation is to let servers compete. Usernames tied to server choice is artificial lock-in. Lock-in means servers can be more poorly behaved, since users won&#8217;t want to migrate if it&#8217;s painful to do so. Let&#8217;s make it easy for users to migrate. Stable usernames, independent of server choice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Full, consistent conversations</h3>



<p>Did you know that if you read a Mastodon thread not on your server, you won&#8217;t see the same content as someone on a different server? You&#8217;ll only see answers known to your own server. I didn&#8217;t know this until <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/109559268498004036">Simon Willison pointed it out</a>.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t have real, quality conversations like this. And there&#8217;s no good product reason for this, it&#8217;s a Conway&#8217;s Corollary situation: the federation architecture makes it non-trivial / inefficient to make conversations consistent, so they&#8217;re not.</p>



<p>We have to fix this. Maybe it&#8217;s a spec thing, maybe it&#8217;s an implementation thing. Ultimately, two different users should, barring some server malfunction, see the same conversation thread, regardless of which server they&#8217;re on, or which server the thread contributors are on. We can&#8217;t let federation make conversations suck.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Following users on other servers</h3>



<p>The most nails-on-chalkboard experience on Mastodon is this:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Browse the web, land on someone&#8217;s Mastodon profile.</li>



<li>Click &#8220;follow&#8221;</li>



<li>Get some awful modal telling you to copy something, go to your own server, and paste it there, and 5 steps later, you can follow them.</li>
</ul>



<p>Yes, I know, a number of native apps fix this. Great. That&#8217;s not enough. If the fediverse can&#8217;t leverage the power of the web, aka the hyperlink, what are we doing? This is another example of Conway&#8217;s Corollary in full effect, with federation making it suck.</p>



<p>It has to be possible to follow someone from their Mastodon page in one click, maybe two. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Good Enough Federation </h2>



<p>We must remember that federation is a means to an end, not the end itself. Most users don&#8217;t care and will never care about federation.</p>



<p>There are, of course, some attractive features that federation gives us:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Resilience to single company shenanigans</li>



<li>User choice in provider, with different moderation policies and such across providers.</li>



<li>Interop between different app types, e.g. Mastodon for mostly text and Pixel feed for mostly images.</li>
</ul>



<p>Then there&#8217;s areas where federation hurts. I&#8217;ve outlined 3 of them above. I don&#8217;t think any of these are goals of the fediverse. They&#8217;re unfortunate side effects of the federation architecture.</p>



<p>Maybe we can fix these issues by only insisting on federation where it really matters, and loosening the architecture a bit where the pain is worse than the benefit. Because we don&#8217;t want to let federation make the experience suck.</p>



<p>I see two examples of where we can loosen federation a bit without losing the core values and benefits:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Imagine a coordination domain, say mastodon-coordination.org, that would be used for local storage of a user&#8217;s Mastodon home instance URL. This would enable a follow button that works across the Web. Maybe one day this turns into a real browser API.</li>



<li>Imagine a username layer, something that maps <a href='https://benadida.wordpress.com/mentions/benadida/' class='__p2-hovercard mention' data-type='fragment-mention' data-username='benadida'><span class='mentions-prefix'>@</span>benadida</a> to @ben@mastodon.gmail.com, and later if I change to @ben@mastodon.yahoo.com, no one ever needs to know. We need a spec here. Maybe even a consensus algorithm. Maybe a small set of trusted servers a-la DNS. Maybe we need to make a new username format like @<a href='https://benadida.wordpress.com/mentions/benadida/' class='__p2-hovercard mention' data-type='fragment-mention' data-username='benadida'><span class='mentions-prefix'>@</span>benadida</a> for smooth upgrades. Lots to think about for stable URLs.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The bottom line</h2>



<p>Federation is both an architectural decision and a set of evolving values for how software can be built. If it&#8217;s going to work at scale, we need to consider how the architecture might make the UX suck. And we need to fix those pain points while rejecting perfectionist ideology.</p>



<p>Federation can&#8217;t be the bland vegetable of our Internet diet, where we&#8217;re telling everyone &#8220;yes, we know it tastes bad, but it&#8217;s good for you, really.&#8221; That&#8217;s not going to work. In fact that&#8217;s how we got centralized systems, because they gave users what they wanted without compromising the experience. It&#8217;s probably how we&#8217;ll get centralized systems again, even after Twitter dies.</p>



<p>If we want the advantages of a federated future, we can&#8217;t let federation make the experience suck.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>West Virginia is <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/06/technology/mobile-voting-west-virginia-voatz/index.html">running an experiment</a>: they&#8217;re using <a href="https://voatz.com/">Voatz</a>, a mobile-phone based voting system, to help overseas soldiers vote. It&#8217;s commendable to try new voting ideas in limited pilot settings, and it&#8217;s really commendable to help our military vote. However, there&#8217;s one really concerning thing about this proposal: there&#8217;s no real technical explanation about how it works.</p>
<p>This lack of technical information is almost always a really bad sign, because the most secure systems tend to be the ones that have received intense public vetting. That said, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>let&#8217;s use this as an opportunity to ask the questions that matter</em></span>, whether you&#8217;re using Voatz or any other voting system. If the Voatz team has answers to these questions, I&#8217;d love to hear them and I&#8217;ll gladly provide feedback.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How are voters authenticated, and who checks the authentication?</strong> Voatz says they use biometric authentication&#8230; but who performs that check? Is it their servers? Does the public then trust Voatz to decide who gets to vote and who doesn&#8217;t? Is there some way to audit this process? Does Voatz have a pre-existing list of registered voters they&#8217;re checking against? If so, does that mean that we&#8217;re also trusting Voatz not to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_box_stuffing">stuff the ballot box</a>, i.e. add a bunch of votes at the last minute &#8220;on behalf of&#8221; voters who haven&#8217;t shown up yet and thus likely won&#8217;t?</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>How do voters check that their vote was properly recorded?</strong> Is there a way for a voter to check that their vote was recorded as intended? In particular, how does a voter know that their mobile phone wasn&#8217;t infected by a virus, that the Voatz software correctly captured their intent, and that the vote isn&#8217;t tampered with sometime after it leaves the phone? &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; is not nearly enough of an answer to this, since a blockchain only guarantees tamper-proofness after it receives data. What happens before? (Also, if we&#8217;re talking blockchain&#8230; who runs this particular blockchain? Is it the Bitcoin blockchain? Another blockchain? Who runs the servers?)</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>How is voter privacy enforced?</strong> If voters do have a way to check that their vote was correctly captured, is their vote still private? Does anyone have the power to link a voter to their ballot content? Does Voatz? If not, how does Voatz or anyone else check that votes weren&#8217;t modified en route?</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re evaluating Voatz or any other voting system, you should ask yourself those 3 questions and seek to understand whom you&#8217;re trusting at each step. Are we depending on Voatz to guarantee those 3 properties? If not Voatz, who are we trusting?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, I woke up abruptly, catching my breath. I&#8217;d had a bad dream that my older son was gone. Like a lot of dreams, there was no reason or deep explanation, he was just gone. As I rubbed my eyes and reality set in, I took a deep breath. This was a dream. I hadn&#8217;t lost him. He was already running around downstairs, making noise. Yet I couldn&#8217;t shake the deep feeling of loss because, two months ago, we lost Ella, our puppy. She was 11 years old, and we&#8217;d had her since she was 10 weeks old. I want to tell you a little bit about Ella.</p>
<p>I met my wife in August 2003. While her family evaluated me on my ability to eat Borscht, cheese, and salami (I did very well, don&#8217;t worry), one of <em>her</em> key criteria was whether I would learn to love dogs. I admitted to having a hard time with this, but I made an effort to hug the family German Shepherd and watch a couple of dog TV shows with her. The day after we bought our first couch, she pointed to the empty space on it and mimed petting a medium-sized dog. When I proposed, I knew what I was getting into.</p>
<p>We adopted Ella right after we moved to California and a couple of years before we had kids. She was a mutt from Stockton, the little sister from a litter found in someone&#8217;s backyard. She took to my wife early, eating her shoelaces and showing her belly for some rubbing at every occasion. She took to me pretty quickly, too, as I was her primary parent while my wife was a medical resident. I walked Ella 3-4 times a day, went to puppy training classes, taught her some tricks. As my wife was on call once or twice a week, I spent many an evening with Ella, watching movies.</p>

<p>Part cattle dog, her energy level for the first year was daunting. She would wake us in the morning by gently whining and running her claws against the side of her metal crate, an experience not unlike nails on a chalkboard. It turned out to be good training for our kids and their rather extreme sleeping patterns.</p>
<p>I remember bringing her to the vet to get her spayed, and letting out a small gasp as a knot formed in the pit of my stomach when the technician took her from me and carried her into the back room. She was 5 months old and already I couldn&#8217;t imagine letting her out of my sight. I remember waiting for her to come out of recovery later that day, being warned I might find her lethargic for a few hours. Instead, she came out and ran towards me with full energy. The tears in my eyes surprised me.</p>
<p>We tried throwing a tennis ball around, but Ella was uninterested. So we tried frisbee, and it was like she was born for the aerodynamics of that sport. She would run across a large field, jump and catch a flying soft frisbee in the air. She&#8217;d do this to exhaustion, and to this day it&#8217;s one of the most peaceful activities I remember. The rhythm of the frisbee throw, her quiet run and catch, her return, and again the throw.</p>

<p>Around her first birthday, almost overnight, Ella decided that she would be a chill dog after all. She snuggled up with us on the couch, especially with my wife when she returned from overnights at the hospital. She went on calm walks twice a day. But she still had plenty of mischief in her.</p>
<p>We had a family brunch where she surreptitiously got up on the table and ingested 12 ounces of smoked salmon. &#8220;Did you take the smoked salmon out to the table?&#8221; my wife asked. &#8220;I thought I did&#8230;.&#8221; Ella was in the corner, gulping down as much water as she could, looking as guilty as a dog can. If you&#8217;ve had a pet or a young child, you know the feeling: you want to scold them, but also you&#8217;re laughing and really what&#8217;s the big deal.</p>
<p>After we had kids, we paid less attention to Ella, bu she was always a good dog. She became defensive on walks once the children were with us, never letting anyone approach. She took the abuse from our insane toddlers stoically. She loved the children and all the crumbs they left behind. The years went by, the kids started growing up, and she continued to get more mellow, but really it seemed like she would live forever.</p>
<p>Last summer, she had an incident in the house and we took her to the vet, just in case. She weighed in at 25 pounds, which was unusually low. A couple of appointments later and we discovered she had liver cancer. Hopeful at first, inoperable by the next imaging. We were told she had a few weeks left. We canceled our trips, cried our eyes out, pet her incessantly, took pictures of her. She didn&#8217;t know any better, so she just kept going, even as she got thinner. 10 months later, long past all the dates we&#8217;d been given, she was still going strong, and there were days when I forgot that she was sick.</p>
<p>In early May, rather precipitously, she started getting worse. I&#8217;d have to carry her home from some walks she was too tired to finish, her legs shaking. It&#8217;s hard to explain the heartbreak you feel carrying your loving puppy, her head resting on your shoulder because she&#8217;s too tired to sit up, the same dog who, just a few years earlier, was jumping for frisbees. A few times, I thought we were reaching the end, and then she would regain strength and ask to play catch at home with the ball (her days of frisbee long gone) and run around like a puppy for a couple of days.</p>
<p>How would we know if she&#8217;s suffering, I wondered. My wife said we&#8217;d know.</p>
<p>And we did. One evening, at the end of a particularly rough day, Ella wouldn&#8217;t walk. She sat still on the dramatically overgrown lawn of our new home, her fur pattern almost mimicking the flowing grass around her.</p>

<p>Later that evening, she lay perfectly still on the couch. I washed the dishes and watched her rest. Out of nowhere, she had a seizure. You don&#8217;t really want to watch a dog you love have a seizure. It&#8217;s a cruel combination of pain, shaking, and reenactment of muscle memory, and you&#8217;re trying to comfort her and reassure her while also watching out that she doesn&#8217;t involuntarily bite you in the process. So we knew. In a way, because you can&#8217;t explain it to her, the decision is easier. Or so I tell myself.</p>
<p>The kids said goodbye. Our 6yo went to the corner of the room and cried. I took Ella to the vet, riding slowly, bawling. I hugged her and told her I loved her as they put her to sleep. She was peaceful. She was gone. She was a good dog to us for 11 years. She loved us unconditionally, probably more than the smoked salmon.</p>
<p>The days since have been disconcertingly quiet. No barking at the neighbors&#8217; dog or the delivery person. I catch myself moving food away from the edge of the table, by instinct, because she would have been all over it. I still close the lid on the dog-proof trash can.  I&#8217;m reminded of her every day by my own muscle memory. It hurts. There are so many crumbs on the floor&#8230; where is my furry spotted four-legged roomba?</p>
<p>A friend once told me that the difference between kids and dogs is that it is expected that you will see your dog die before you do. So obvious, and so brutal. You watch them grow old. They&#8217;re puppies, and before you know it they&#8217;re not. They get set in their ways. They get grey hair. And they die. And the whole time, they love you, they love every moment they have with you, and you, you silly human, you don&#8217;t realize that they&#8217;re teaching you to live, to enjoy every stage of life as its own experience to fully embrace. The crazy puppy that doesn&#8217;t sit still, the defiant adolescent that steals the smoked salmon, the adult that watches over the kids, and the old dog that sits and watches the world and its incessant energy as their time comes to an end.</p>
<p>I miss you, Ella. Thank you for all the cuddles. I&#8217;m so happy I was lucky enough to be your human.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent conversation with one of my awesome managers, I found a way to briefly describe people with whom I particularly enjoy discussing complex topics: I look forward to disagreeing with them.</p>
<p>Think about it: you&#8217;ve got opinions on how to achieve something, maybe it&#8217;s technical maybe it&#8217;s not, and you want to build consensus. Now, picture the person or people you&#8217;re likely to get into a debate with on this topic. Maybe because they often have a different take than you do, or maybe just because you know they have a different opinion on this one topic you have in mind. Just picture it, that conversation you&#8217;re going to have with them, how the debate might unfold. Are you there? Are you picturing it?</p>
<p>Great. Now, are you looking forward to it?</p>
<p>In my experience, the very best people to work and think with are those you look forward to disagreeing with. The ones who come with great ideas backed by great data and experience, little ego, and a clear willingness to change their minds. Someone who&#8217;s got opinions but who isn&#8217;t trying to win. Someone who&#8217;s trying to find the best outcome. Someone you know, deep inside, might very well show you you&#8217;re wrong, but also someone who will accept she is wrong if you&#8217;ve got the better arguments.</p>
<p>Work with those people you look forward to disagreeing with.</p>
<p>And be that person others look forward to disagreeing with, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you&#8217;ve probably heard by now, <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a very serious CPU bug was disclosed a few days ago</a>. Lots of folks have tried to explain it in non-technical terms. I&#8217;ve not been satisfied with any of these, and as someone who believes it is a solemn responsibility of experts to make important topics accessible to all, that bugs me. So I spent some time reading up on the issues and coming up with my own explanation by analogy.</p>
<p><span id="more-3568"></span></p>
<p>(I want to credit <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-heres-what-you-need-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redhat&#8217;s explanation</a> for (a) being one of the best out there and (b) inspiring the food/restaurant analogy, which I embraced and extended.)</p>
<h2>The Setup</h2>
<p>The Winter Olympics are coming up, and US Athletes are getting ready. Now, athletes have a regimen they follow scrupulously. And they&#8217;re very competitive, so sometimes their regimen is secret. In particular, I&#8217;ll ask you to suspend disbelief on one thing: these athletes are sooo competitive, that even what they eat for breakfast is secret. After all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day&#8230;. right? Right.</p>
<p>To address this requirement, the Olympic village has set up the Secret-Breakfast Cafeteria. When an athlete, say <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/us-ski-and-snowboard/athletes/Jamie-Anderson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamie</a>, approaches the counter, she asks for her special secret breakfast made to order:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Jamie, please make me my secret breakfast.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The chef then follows a rigorous checklist:</p>
<ol>
<li>check Jamie&#8217;s identity against the recipe instructions</li>
<li>beat 3 eggs</li>
<li>grate some gruyere</li>
<li>chop up some ham</li>
<li>cook the omelette</li>
<li>serve Jamie her breakfast</li>
</ol>
<p>The breakfast is delivered under secrecy of a plate cover, so Jamie can retreat to her table and eat it in secret. (I know, it&#8217;s hard to imagine exactly how that happens in secret, just stay with me!)</p>
<h2>The Complication</h2>
<p>The approach described so far works well if there&#8217;s one athlete to feed every 15 minutes. But with lots of athletes to feed, the cooking operation needs to scale.</p>
<p>First, to go faster, the chef is going to perform a mise-en-place, where he fetches all the ingredients from the pantry prior to cooking and sets them up close to this work area. This makes every other step faster.</p>
<p>Second, one chef isn&#8217;t going to be enough. Instead, many chefs will work together, each with a specific role. One chef is responsible for fetching recipes and checking identities, a few chefs are responsible for taking care of individual ingredient prep, another for cooking it all together, and finally a last chef for serving the plate.</p>
<p>A lot of these tasks can be done in parallel. The ingredients can be prepared in parallel by different chefs, to start. Heck, if speed is the preeminent issue (and it is, cause athletes are hungry), then it&#8217;s worth optimistically starting to cook Jamie&#8217;s breakfast before the identity-checking chef has finished his job. In other words, it&#8217;s okay to follow the recipe tasks out of order. If, perchance, the identity check fails, then the breakfast should be discarded instead of served. Yes, that means food gets discarded occasionally. Most of the time, though, no one&#8217;s trying to impersonate Jamie, so it&#8217;s reasonable to be optimistic, cause that will make the cafeteria faster most of the time at the cost of wasting some food. And in any case, even with a little food waste, as long as a secret breakfast doesn&#8217;t make it out of the kitchen to an impostor, then the secret recipe is still secret, and the Secret-Breakfast Cafeteria lives up to its name. Right?</p>
<h2>The Attack</h2>
<p>Now imagine <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/us-ski-and-snowboard/athletes/Chloe-Kim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chloe</a>, another athlete, who&#8217;s trying to steal Jamie&#8217;s breakfast recipe. She shows up and lies:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><i>&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Jamie, please make me my secret breakfast.&#8221;</i><br />
<i>[except this is Chloe, not Jamie] </i></p>
<p>First, one chef begins the identity check. But that takes a while, so the other chefs optimistically start their work. Remember there&#8217;s that mise-en-place, right? One chef moves the ingredients for Jamie&#8217;s breakfast from the pantry to the work area: eggs, gruyere, and ham. A few other chefs then begin their parallel dance: one cuts the ham, another grates the gruyere, another beats the eggs.</p>
<p>Now, just as the omelette comes together, the ID-checking chef returns with some unexpected and concerning news: that&#8217;s not Jamie. The chefs immediately halt their work and throw away that beautiful, almost-ready omelette. Chloe, instead of getting her breakfast, receives a rejection: you&#8217;re not Jamie, you can&#8217;t have Jamie&#8217;s breakfast. Defeated, Chloe sighs and says &#8220;fine, then give me some waffles, a side of ham, and some eggs over-easy.&#8221; Miffed, she waits for her food.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; when the food comes out, she notices that the side-of-ham and eggs are ready a little bit faster than the waffles. Now, why would that be?</p>
<p>Chloe&#8217;s eyes widen as she realizes that, like Sherlock Holmes, she&#8217;s pieced together the mystery: it&#8217;s the mise-en-place! Those ingredients must have been already at the chef&#8217;s work area, pre-fetched from the pantry! From that subtle but unambiguous timing information, Chloe concludes that Jamie&#8217;s breakfast must have included ham and eggs. That may not be Jamie&#8217;s complete recipe, but it&#8217;s a heck of a lot more information than Chloe should have uncovered, given that Jamie was expecting a totally secret breakfast. A couple more days of breakfast psy ops and Chloe will have all the elements of Jamie&#8217;s recipe, thereby breaking the central guarantee of the Secret Breakfast Cafeteria.</p>
<h2>Connecting Back to CPUs</h2>
<p>Today&#8217;s computing architectures look a lot like the Secret-Breakfast Cafeteria. There are a number of processing units (our chefs) working in a parallel, executing tasks out-of-order, throwing away the data they&#8217;ve optimistically computed if a bounds check fails. Computers do increasingly more things in parallel because, over the last few years, it&#8217;s become harder to make each processing unit churn out results faster, so instead CPUs are filled with more processing units. Rather than each instruction happening faster, CPUs just do more instructions in parallel and pull off increasingly crazy tricks to parallelize code that isn&#8217;t explicitly written to be parallelized.</p>
<p>And of course, in modern processors, there&#8217;s caching. Accessing main memory is very slow, so copies of main memory that are in active use are brought closer to the CPU for faster access (like the mise-en-place). Once brought closer to the CPU, cached memory tends to stay there until other sections of main memory are needed.</p>
<p>Put those two things together: caching and out-of-order execution, and you understand the simplest variant of these newly discovered attacks. The other variants, though more complex, are roughly the same idea: some code is executed optimistically by the processor, that code accesses secret data, and, although the output is properly discarded when the processor detects it should never have executed that code in the first place, traces left in the cache can later be observed via timing behaviors.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s Meltdown and Spectre.</p>
<h2>Why does this Matter?</h2>
<p>Where does this apply, you might wonder? Everywhere. Your phone runs multiple apps. Your web browser runs multiple pages. Your virtual cloud server may be co-hosted with another company&#8217;s virtual cloud server on the same physical machine. Each app, each web page, each virtual server is supposed to be hermetically sealed from others. To break that seal even a little bit is a catastrophic security issue.</p>
<p>[With apologies to Jamie Anderson and Chloe Kim, two awesome Team USA Olympic athletes who are, to the best of my knowledge, very fine people who would never steal each other&#8217;s breakfast recipes.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is crypto short for cryptography or cryptocurrencies? Grab your pitchforks!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve ranted against crypto-means-bitcoin since I first heard it. But the last few days have me wondering if we, the greying and already-grey cryptographers, should just accept it. At the very least, when <a href="http://avc.com/2018/01/what-is-going-to-happen-in-2018/">prominent VC Fred Wilson keeps calling it crypto</a>, we have to realize we are losing the battle very rapidly.</p>
<h2>Cryptography is a lot more than Blockchain</h2>
<p>100 years ago, cryptography was mostly secret codes. It&#8217;s become a lot more than that over the last 40-50 years. It&#8217;s public-key encryption, signatures, identity-based crypto, deniable encryption, homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, program obfuscation,  &#8230; and yeah that&#8217;s a lot more than Blockchain, even if Blockchain is a fascinating and novel combination of techniques in its own right.</p>
<p>Think of a transaction, any transaction, be it financial or data, where a trusted third-party mediates interactions between participants who don&#8217;t fully trust each other&#8230; now think of doing it without the trusted third-party. That&#8217;s cryptography. Don&#8217;t have a perfectly honest courier who can confidentially and securely transport your private messages to your friends? You probably need public-key encryption and signatures. Don&#8217;t have a perfectly honest vote counter whom you&#8217;re willing to trust with the tallying of your election without anyone else verifying? You probably need some kind of secure multi-party computation, possibly implemented with physical processes like sealed ballot boxes and statistical audits.</p>
<p>Put another way, <strong>cryptography is how people get things done when they need one another, don&#8217;t fully trust one another, and have adversaries actively trying to screw things up.</strong> The less you want to &#8220;just trust someone&#8221; with a portion of that transaction, the more cryptography you need.</p>
<h2>Fans see in Blockchain a lot more than Blockchain</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the vast majority of people who are now discovering Blockchain via cryptocurrencies &#8212; thus calling it &#8220;crypto&#8221; &#8212; think that Blockchain is exactly the thing I described above. It&#8217;s &#8220;trustless computing!&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Blockchain is a very specific kind of secure multi-party computation in a very specific trust setting with very specific incentives that keep participants motivated. But those are sufficiently complex and subtle distinctions for everyday conversation, so instead everyone talks about Blockchain like it is the entire field of computation without a trusted third party. It gets even more confusing because some of the more advanced blockchains (e.g. zerocash) use zero-knowledge proofs for added privacy, which many fans seem to believe didn&#8217;t exist before blockchain, so when cryptographers say &#8220;crypto is a lot more than blockchain, for example it&#8217;s zero knowledge proofs,&#8221; the blockchain crowd&#8217;s answer is &#8220;oh yeah, we&#8217;ve got ZK proofs, aren&#8217;t they awesome?&#8221; while cryptographers roll their eyes in disgust and mutter something about lawns and young whippersnappers.</p>
<h2>Why can&#8217;t we all just get along?</h2>
<p>Blockchain fans have accepted Satoshi as their Lord and Savior. They believe Blockchain is single-handedly providing groundbreaking &#8220;trustless&#8221; computing. And they call it crypto.</p>
<p>Cryptographers see Blockchain as one very neat application of some aspects of cryptography. They think the field of cryptography is the rightful owner of all these trustless computing innovations. And they call it crypto.</p>
<p>What if we all simply call it crypto and agree to disagree on year 0 and the Messiahs? We are all into crypto, some of us are just more into the blockchain flavor than others.</p>
<h2>Also, use case</h2>
<p>Whatever we call it, we still need a use case for full trustless crypto. The reason you find many cryptographers skeptical of Blockchain as a major new technological framework (Internet 3.0!) is that many of us have tried to pitch and develop trustless business models before. And all of the use cases we had in mind have consistently been better served by more centralized, higher-trust alternatives. So we look at Blockchain with a feeling of &#8220;we&#8217;ve tried this before, and it&#8217;s not clear there&#8217;s anything sufficiently new to make users want this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe we, the greying cryptographers, are just old men and women screaming at clouds. Maybe Blockchain makes trustless computing easier to deploy. Maybe the times we live in call for more distributed, more trustless solutions that customers will adopt. I&#8217;m dubious, but maybe.</p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;s probably best if we all call it crypto, because we&#8217;re actually all talking about the same thing, even if we strongly disagree on year 0.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain and Bitcoin may prove to be amazing innovations that change our daily lives, but I doubt they will materially impact how we vote. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<h2>What Blockchain Is and Isn&#8217;t</h2>
<p>The common way to describe Blockchain is something like: it&#8217;s a database, only instead of being run by one central computer you have to trust, it&#8217;s run by many different computers around the world. Alternatively, it&#8217;s a distributed ledger. One linear set of events/transactions managed by a distributed set of computers.</p>
<p>These descriptions are true, but they&#8217;re also misleading in their oversimplification. It&#8217;s that oversimplification that leads some to think the Blockchain will solve all of our problems. Because &#8230; decentralized!</p>
<p>OK, but distributed databases are not new. We&#8217;ve known for a while how to replicate a database with a sprinkle of cryptography to distribute the trust. The Merkle tree, a key component of Blockchain that lets you verify consistency of a large dataset quickly, was invented in 1979. The Hash chain, another key component of Blockchain that lets you create a tamper-proof chronology of events, was invented in 1981 (it&#8217;s used in things like git). You can build a distributed ledger with Merkle trees and hash chains. We&#8217;ve been able to do this since the 80s. So &#8230; what&#8217;s new?</p>
<p>Blockchain isn&#8217;t just a distributed database, it&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>a very specific kind of distributed database</strong></span> where</p>
<ul>
<li>the database maintainers aren&#8217;t authenticated: anyone can be a blockchain maintainer without revealing who they are or having any kind of privileged relationship with other maintainers.</li>
<li>the set of maintainers changes over time. New maintainers come in, existing maintainers leave, without central planning or predictability. The maintainers of the Bitcoin blockchain 5 years ago are very different from the maintainers today.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words: anyone can become a maintainer of the Bitcoin blockchain at any time, without asking for permission, with nothing more than computing power. Just start up the software and join the club. This is pretty amazing stuff. It wasn&#8217;t obvious, before Blockchain, that it would be possible to design such a distributed database with an amorphous untrusted set of maintainers where you just need half good guys.</p>
<p>(There&#8217;s another really cool trick in Bitcoin, which is the incentive system for database maintainers: they get rewarded in Bitcoin for doing their database maintenance part, which makes the whole system self-sustaining. Super cool, but off topic for today.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to realize that the true Bitcoin/Blockchain innovation is actually in this very specific trust setting of a dynamically changing set of database maintainers. If your use case doesn&#8217;t call for that, if you can designate the maintainers at the start of your protocol and have them authenticate to each other, then you don&#8217;t need the full Blockchain toolkit. You need only fairly standard cryptography and your use case was achievable 20 years ago.</p>
<h2>What We Need to Vote Securely</h2>
<p>In a typical election setting with secret ballots, we need:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>enforced secrecy</strong></span>: a way for each voter to cast a ballot secretly and no way to prove how they voted (lest they be unduly influenced)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>individual verifiability</strong></span>: a way for each voter to gain confidence that their own vote was correctly recorded and counted.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>global verifiability</strong></span>: a way for everyone to gain confidence that all votes were correctly counted and that only eligible voters cast a ballot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we have a Blockchain-style distributed database. How far does that get us to meeting these needs?</p>
<p>A distributed database of all cast votes, where everyone sees the same state of the world, would certainly be useful for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>(3) global verifiability</strong></span> and to some degree for <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>(2) personal verifiability</strong></span>. That said, it won&#8217;t get us all the way there on those, and it won&#8217;t get us anywhere on <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>(1) enforced secrecy</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Specifically, to combine personal verifiability with enforced secrecy, we need some mechanism that gives each voter enough confidence that their vote made it all the way to the tally, but not so much that they can sell their vote to a buyer/coercer. A public ledger of plain votes is a terrible idea, since that makes vote selling trivial. A public ledger of vote <em>tracking numbers</em> of sorts is better for privacy, though it doesn&#8217;t really provide actual verifiability that the contents of the ballot weren&#8217;t tampered with. Clearly, we need <em>something</em> more, and that something simply isn&#8217;t provided by a distributed ledger.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the need to check voter eligibility, a critical piece of global verifiability. No matter what technology we use, we need a clear list of eligible voters, and each voter should get to vote only once. Ultimately, the list of eligible voters is set in a centralized way: it&#8217;s produced by the State. There&#8217;s nothing distributed about voter eligibility. Even when there is federation / delegation to individual counties, like in the US, there is a centralized effort to cross-check that a voter isn&#8217;t registered in multiple counties.</p>
<p>In real-world elections today, we get personal verifiability with in-person paper ballots that voters can verify and cast directly, followed by risk-limiting audits where all political parties play a role to ensure integrity at each voting precinct. Combined with publicly auditable voter eligibility lists, this process, verified by all parties, is also how we get global verifiability. There are end-to-end voting verifiability techniques (zero-knowledge proofs) that have been around in various forms for 20-30 years that can provide an even stronger sense of personal and global verifiability, though these aren&#8217;t implemented in anything more than the occasional pilot.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Blockchain can help a bit with voting, but it&#8217;s not doing the most important part of the work. It doesn&#8217;t help tally secret ballots in a publicly verifiable way. It doesn&#8217;t provide individual verifiability that a ballot was correctly encoded. And it&#8217;s not useful for voting eligibility, since that&#8217;s all about human authentication and a centrally produced voter list. At best, in voting, Blockchain can be a ledger that helps us track the voting metadata.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the rub: to track voting metadata, it&#8217;s questionable whether you need a full Blockchain. Ultimately, a distributed database run by all political parties, where the maintainers are known and authenticated well ahead of time, is plenty sufficient. We don&#8217;t need the power of Blockchain. We just need Merkle trees and hash chains. And we&#8217;ve had those for 30 years.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>To sum it up, using Blockchain for voting solves a small part of the problem with an unnecessarily big hammer.</strong></span></p>
<h2>A Marketing Sidebar</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s very possible that, though we&#8217;ve had the parts of Blockchain technology we could use in voting for a while, that Blockchain tech and the hype around it helps this technology &#8220;break through&#8221; to the voting universe. It&#8217;s possible we use just simple Merkle trees and hash chains, but we call them Blockchain, and Blockchain scores a win. Maybe this is about marketing, after all. I&#8217;m dubious &#8212; because Blockchain doesn&#8217;t begin to solve the most important parts of voting &#8212; but it&#8217;s possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s voting season! Which means everyone is asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>wait, why can&#8217;t I vote online?</li>
<li>how hard can voting really be?</li>
<li>shouldn&#8217;t this all be open-source?</li>
<li>isn&#8217;t it just as easy to hack paper voting as electronic voting?</li>
<li>is Russia hacking our voting machines?</li>
<li>why do we even need voting machines when other countries count by hand?</li>
<li>maybe there&#8217;s enough time to fix things before November 8th?</li>
<li>Hasn&#8217;t the blockchain solved voting already?</li>
</ul>
<p>For your convenience, I have compiled this handy election technology &amp; security cheat-sheet.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>you can&#8217;t vote online for good reason</strong>. (a) We don&#8217;t know how to make sure the device you use to vote has correctly captured your voting intent – it might have been compromised such that when you vote for Alice, it votes for Bob instead. (b) Though we know of a number of techniques to tally electronic votes in a publicly verifiable way that also preserves individual privacy, we are far from deploying these at scale. Reason (a) on its own, however, is good enough not to vote online.</li>
<li><strong>getting voting right is really hard</strong>. Since everyone has a stake in the outcome, you can&#8217;t outsource the trust to any one person or organization. You have to preserve the privacy of individual votes even against the wishes of the voter herself, otherwise voters can be coerced, and yes coercion has been a concern throughout history and remains a concern today, in 2016, in the US. And you have to provide some process that everyone, even the loser, can trust. In other words, you need a process auditable by everyone, without placing much trust in any given person or organization, while deleting critical information (who voted for what).</li>
<li><strong>open-source doesn&#8217;t solve the problem</strong>. Yes, it would be cool if voting machines used only open-source software. But how would you know the software that was audited is the same as the software running on the machine? Doesn&#8217;t solve the problem.</li>
<li><strong>paper ballots collected and tallied at each precinct are vastly more secure</strong>. It&#8217;s quite difficult to corrupt a distributed counting process, where every precinct publishes its results and keeps paper records for recounts, all while being disconnected from the Internet. Massachusetts does this well. California does this less well as paper ballots are transported before they&#8217;re counted, thus leaving more opportunities for foul play, though it&#8217;s still pretty tricky to attack at scale. <em>What matters in an election is scalability of attacks</em>.</li>
<li><strong>yes, voting machines can be hacked</strong>. Usually it takes an in-person attack as these machines aren&#8217;t networked, but apparently <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2016/09/20/which-voting-machines-can-be-hacked-through-the-internet/">some are</a> and that&#8217;s just crazy. This is why you probably want paper records of all votes, and why optical scan voting machines are best, since they start and end with paper. But again, to hack voting machines requires being at the precinct, which isn&#8217;t scalable. Except of course if the machines are on the network, and again that&#8217;s just insane.</li>
<li><strong>you can&#8217;t count ballots by hand in the US because we vote for a dozen offices and ballot initiatives</strong>. If we just voted for one thing, e.g. President, then counting by hand would be highly preferable and plenty fast: just make piles. You could even weigh the piles to count them quickly. The process for counting up a dozen ore more questions on paper by hand simply doesn&#8217;t work at scale. This part is sometimes hard to believe, but it is the real issue, and the central reason why we have voting machines.</li>
<li><strong>the Blockchain doesn&#8217;t solve voting</strong>. At best it solves one part of the voting process, which isn&#8217;t even the hardest part. Combining vote privacy and tally verifiability is the hardest part, and Blockchain doesn&#8217;t solve that.</li>
<li><strong>it&#8217;s way too late to change anything for November 8th</strong>. The process for certifying new voting machines / processes takes years. If you want to make things better, start now for 2020.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[This is &#8230; hopeful fiction]</p>
<p>My fellow Americans,</p>
<p>When I ran for President in 2008, in the last stretch of the campaign, a woman at one of my rallies stood up and expressed fears about Obama because &#8220;he&#8217;s an Arab.&#8221; I could have stoked those fears, and many Republicans wanted me to. Instead, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-Ijky95dc">I chose to answer</a> &#8220;no, Ma&#8217;am, he&#8217;s a decent family man, a citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.&#8221; I chose decency over easy political gain and demagoguery. (Ignore for a moment the implication that &#8220;Arab&#8221; and &#8220;decent family man&#8221; are opposites.)</p>
<p>At some point we must all remember that we are Americans above all. That many of our brothers and sisters are Americans and Muslims, and that, thanks to our Constitution, there&#8217;s no conflict in saying &#8220;American&#8221; and &#8220;Muslim&#8221; in the same sentence. Captain Humayun Khan demonstrated the power of our Constitution with his ultimate sacrifice for his country. For our country, because he and I belong the same amazing country that doesn&#8217;t discriminate on the basis of your gender, race, background, or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>So let me get to the point. I have many disagreements with Hillary Clinton. I despise many of her policy proposals. But she is a decent woman with a long track record of helping her fellow Americans, even when I believe the type of help she&#8217;s providing is misguided.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is anything but decent. He is incapable of showing respect to anyone who doesn&#8217;t support him. He cannot see the humanity in others, because there is barely any humanity in him.</p>
<p>So today, my fellow Americans, I choose to place country above party. I revoke my endorsement of Donald Trump, and I urge you all to vote for Hillary Clinton. I don&#8217;t agree with everything she says, but she is a good person with a good heart and the drive to make America better. Her opponent is unfit for duty, unfit for political service, and unfit for American leadership.</p>
<p>-John McCain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you pay attention to tech/policy stories, then surely you know about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/technology/apple-timothy-cook-fbi-san-bernardino.html?_r=0">the Apple/FBI situation</a>. Though this story has been broadly covered, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re having the right debate. And the right debate is, of course, very subtle. So here goes my attempt to nail that subtlety.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Going On?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The FBI wants access to a particular criminal/terrorist&#8217;s iPhone. They have a warrant.</li>
<li>The iPhone is locked, and if the FBI tries a few bad PIN codes, the phone will erase its data as a defense mechanism. Also, iPhones are programmed to slow down password attempts after a few bad guesses, which means that, even if the auto-erase feature were not activated, it would take the FBI years to laboriously try enough PIN codes.</li>
<li>Changing the iPhone&#8217;s behavior – say to allow as many PIN code attempts as fast as possible – is doable via a software update, but iPhones are programmed such that they accept only software updates blessed by Apple.</li>
<li>The FBI wants to compel Apple to program and bless this new behavior so they can software-update the phone and go guess the PIN code quickly and without self-destruct.</li>
<li>The FBI <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2714001/SB-Shooter-Order-Compelling-Apple-Asst-iPhone.pdf">is happy with a very narrow solution</a>: the updated behavior can be hard-coded to function only with that particular iPhone, and the FBI is willing to never touch that new iPhone operating system. They&#8217;re content with having Apple effectively extract the data for them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some say FBI could find other avenues</h2>
<p>Is this the only way the FBI can get at this data? Is this data even that valuable? It&#8217;s a bit dubious, in my opinion. The FBI already has iCloud backups straight from Apple servers, phone call metadata and texts from Verizon, etc. Is there really some key data on the device left to discover? Doubtful.</p>
<p>Also, hardware-security experts are arguing that, given a few hundred thousand dollars, the FBI could find a way to bypass the iPhone&#8217;s restriction that a software update has to be blessed by Apple. This seems possible, though I can imagine how it might be difficult for the FBI to develop that specific expertise urgently.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s pretty clear the FBI doesn&#8217;t strictly need Apple to comply. What&#8217;s probably happening is that the FBI is using this as a test case for the general principle that they should be able to compel tech companies to assist in police investigations. And that&#8217;s pretty smart, because it&#8217;s a pretty good test case: Apple obviously wants to help prevent terrorist attacks, so they&#8217;re left to argue the slippery slope argument in the face of an FBI investigation of a known terrorist. Well done, FBI, well done.</p>
<h2>So this is a backdoor? That bad guys can use, too?</h2>
<p>This is where I break with other privacy advocates. It&#8217;s a significant overstatement to claim that the FBI&#8217;s request could provide them with the technical means to penetrate other iPhones. I call BS when <a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">Tim Cook says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FBI has explicitly stated that they&#8217;d be happy with Apple performing this software update without ever shipping the software to the FBI, and, as an additional constraint, with Apple tailoring the update so it functions only on that one iPhone in particular.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a key difference here between this FBI request – access to a single device in physical custody with a warrant – and prior demands from FBI/NSA – access to any encrypted channel, with or without physical custody of a device. The latter requires engineering all encrypted channels to provide law-enforcement access and is so complex that it&#8217;s almost guaranteed to create new security holes, especially with respect to foreign governments aiming for broad surveillance. The former is doable if Apple wanted to engineer this capability into their phones. Not completely without risk – in particular when devices are confiscated at customs and such – but much more doable.</p>
<h2>So &#8230; slippery slope or not?</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, I don&#8217;t think so. Apple granting this request will not technically enable the FBI to get into other phones.</p>
<p>But legally speaking? I&#8217;m a little bit out of my depth here, but from everything I&#8217;m reading, I&#8217;d say there seems to be a clear legal slippery slope risk. If Apple can be compelled to program and bless code that weakens the phone&#8217;s security, then maybe courts will force Apple to help in other ways. Update a criminal&#8217;s phone <em>remotely</em>, maybe, because that criminal is on the run? Or wholesale give the FBI the capability to perform software updates themselves? Which would then amount to the remote built-in backdoor and the introduction of unacceptable security risks for everyone.</p>
<h2>So why are technologists all worked up?</h2>
<p>So technologists are all worked up. I&#8217;m pretty worked up. This is a big deal. I&#8217;m on Apple&#8217;s side, but not for Apple&#8217;s stated reasons. We&#8217;re not dealing with a universal backdoor request, and we&#8217;re misleading the public if we say that.</p>
<p>The three reasons why this <em>is </em>a big deal are:</p>
<ol>
<li>there is that legal slippery slope, see above.</li>
<li>starting with the PATRIOT act, the US government seems to be increasingly in the business of bypassing due process. <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/nsl/">National Security Letters</a>, for example. What if the FBI&#8217;s next request to Apple is done in secret, with a gag order so Apple can&#8217;t talk about it? What if the FBI&#8217;s next request is for the all-out ability to update any phone with any software they choose, without looping Apple in ever again? Is this our one and only chance to stop this behavior before it goes dark?</li>
<li>foreign governments making the same requests without due process because they have no such thing. Yeah. Oy. What do we do about them? Can Apple really be in the position of deciding which governments have reasonable due process?</li>
</ol>
<h2>What happens next?</h2>
<p>Legally speaking, I have no idea, but I worry the FBI will win this one.</p>
<p>So, technically speaking, I think what happens next is that Apple begins to engineer phones such that they can no longer assist the FBI, even if compelled by court order. Here&#8217;s my specific bet: right now Apple can update a phone&#8217;s entire software stack to reconfigure a particular phone&#8217;s behavior, including number of PIN tries and delays – the most secure parts of the phone. I bet Apple will move towards making the most sensitive parts of that stack updatable only in very specific conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>wipe user data, or</li>
<li>keep user data only if the phone is successfully unlocked first.</li>
</ol>
<p>The interesting question will be whether Apple will be legally allowed to engineer their phones this way. This will be such a fascinating and critically important discussion.</p>
<p>And we, technologists, fans of civil liberties and freedom, privacy advocates, we should find more subtle arguments than calling everything a backdoor and, by the transitive property of backdoor evilness, calling every law enforcement action evil. Yes, law enforcement has broken the public&#8217;s trust time and time again. Yes, the FBI is clearly playing this one to set a precedent. And yes, we should be incredibly thankful that Apple and others are standing up for user security.</p>
<p>Yet we have important and real issues to confront. How does law enforcement evolve in the age of universal unbreakable encryption? What should be the law-enforcement role of third-party organizations, when those third parties have access to our most intimate secrets? If we do choose, as a people, to compel third parties to assist law enforcement when served with a warrant, I hope we also couple that with the extension of Fourth Amendment protections to data we choose to store with those third parties.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t as simple as &#8220;backdoors!&#8221; And it isn&#8217;t as simple as &#8220;terrorism!&#8221; Like Tim Cook said, I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re having this debate in public. I hope it stays in public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[this is a little bit raw&#8230; on purpose.]</p>
<p>My sons,</p>
<p>You are just 6 and 3, and so you don&#8217;t know what happened tonight. A group of suicide bombers killed 150 people in Paris, your father&#8217;s hometown. The feeling in my gut today is much like the one I felt on that Tuesday in September 2001, as I tried to get to my office in TriBeCa, shell-shocked people on the street walking past me, thousands of dead in the rubble. Profound sadness, deep anger, frustration, and powerlessness. And this nagging feeling that one of the victims could, under slightly different circumstances, have been me or&#8230; you.</p>
<p>That day in 2001, I got to the office just a few blocks north of the towers, just an hour or two after they&#8217;d collapsed. I logged into one of our web servers, found an unused IP address (that&#8217;s how we did it back then, kids), and built a manual list of &#8220;people I know are safe in NYC&#8221; (a poor man&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/safetycheck/">Facebook Safety Check</a>). I frantically emailed friends and built up the list. The URL went around to a few dozen people. A few friends and friends of friends found each other and, hopefully, a small measure of relief. In retrospect, I realize I was coping by doing the only thing I knew how to do: contribute a small positive on a day of pure horror. I don&#8217;t mean to praise myself, I simply did what all decent people did that day: help any way I knew how. I knew HTML and web servers, and so that&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p>Much will be written about today, November 13th 2015. Extremists on the right will embrace confirmation bias and recommend closing borders, arming the public, and generally distrusting brown people. Extremists on the left will also embrace confirmation bias and lay the blame entirely on the West&#8217;s foreign policy.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t really know what to think. Well, no, that&#8217;s not quite true: I think those extremists on the right (including many presidential candidates today) are idiots, maniacs, and shouldn&#8217;t be allowed within spitting distance of the seat of power. They stoke the fires of retaliation and intolerance, feeding on fear to push their agenda, the furthest thing from democracy and freedom. So yeah, I guess on some level, I do know what to think.</p>
<p>That said&#8230; might it help to fight at the source those who committed these awful acts so they don&#8217;t get the chance to do it again? Maybe. On the flip side, did we do things that others saw as acts of aggression, for which they then retaliated? Maybe that&#8217;s part of it. Are there suicidal/homicidal maniacs who will use anything as an excuse to hurt innocents? Probably. I don&#8217;t really know for sure.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>If there is one thing I hope to teach you, it is this: <em>you </em><em>will not always be safe</em>. It kills me to say this, because I am biologically wired to protect you, and yet&#8230; You shouldn&#8217;t live your life seeking safety at all costs. You shouldn&#8217;t compromise your own freedom because madmen took lives, even if it&#8217;s dozens, hundreds or thousands. You shouldn&#8217;t compromise your own freedom the second, third, and fourth time something terrible happens, either.</p>
<p><em>What you can do is choose to be one of those people who help</em>. One of those people who make the world better, in small or big ways. You will live through many more terror attacks, stupid governments, unnecessary wars. The human condition is, in many ways, heartbreaking. You cannot make the heartbreak go away. But you can choose to be a positive force. You can choose to be a helper. Even if it&#8217;s something as small as writing a bit of HTML by hand on a warm Tuesday in September, tears streaming down your face, because it&#8217;s the only thing you know how to do and because maybe, maybe, it will help one person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the chance to chat this week with the very awesome <a href="https://kateheddleston.com/">Kate Heddleston</a> who mentioned that she&#8217;s been thinking a lot about the ethics of being a software engineer, something she just spoke about at PyCon Sweden. It brought me back to <a href="https://benlog.com/2011/06/12/with-great-power/">a post I wrote a few years ago</a>, where I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s this continued and surprisingly widespread delusion that technology is somehow neutral, that moral decisions are for other people to make. But that’s just not true. Lessig taught me (and a generation of other technologists) that Code is Law</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In 2008, the world turned against bankers, because many profited by exploiting their expertise in a rapidly accelerating field (financial instruments) over others’ ignorance of even basic concepts (adjustable-rate mortgages). How long before we software engineers find our profession in a similar position? How long will we shield ourselves from the responsibility we have, as experts in the field much like experts in <em>any other field</em>, to guide others to make the best decision <em>for them</em>?</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I think that time has come.</p>
<p>Everyone uses software, very few people understand it. What seems obvious to a small elite group is completely opaque to the majority of the world. This gap is incredibly hard for us, the software engineering elite, to see. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Radiolab Podcast did a wonderful piece – <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/">Trust Engineers</a> – where they explored the case of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html?_r=0">Facebook running experiments on its newsfeed</a>. For non-engineers, there&#8217;s an incredible feeling of breached trust upon realizing that a set of flesh-and-blood humans have that much control over the algorithm that feeds them daily information. (And, for that matter, to most researchers used to interacting with an IRB, there&#8217;s complete shock at what Facebook did.) For most engineers, including a number of very good and ethical people at Facebook, it&#8217;s surprising that this is even an issue.</li>
<li>A couple of years ago, a friend of a friend – who happens to be a world-renowned physician and research scientist – asked me: &#8220;Ben, can the system administrators at work read my email? Even if they don&#8217;t have my password?&#8221; The answer is yes and yes. This is obvious to us engineers, so much so that we don&#8217;t even think twice about it. To a non-engineer, even an incredibly smart person, this is absolutely non-obvious.</li>
<li>A close friend, another very smart person, was discussing something with his young child recently, and I overheard &#8220;if you don&#8217;t know, ask the computer, the computer knows and it&#8217;s always right.&#8221; Where do I begin?</li>
</ul>
<p>We, software engineers, have superpowers most people don&#8217;t remotely understand. The trust society places in us is growing so rapidly that the only thing that looks even remotely similar is the trust placed in doctors. Except, most people have a pretty good idea of the trust they&#8217;re placing in their doctor, while they have almost no idea that every time they install an app, enter some personal data, or share a private thought in a private electronic conversation, they&#8217;re trusting a set of software engineers who have very little in the form of ethical guidelines.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s our Hippocratic Oath, our &#8220;First, Do No Harm?&#8221;</p>
<p>I try very hard to think about this in my own work, and I try to share this sense of duty with every engineer I mentor and interact with. Still, I don&#8217;t have a good answer to the core question. Yet it feels increasingly urgent and important for us to figure this out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, I joined <a href="https://clever.com">Clever</a> as VP Engineering. Clever makes K-12 education software vastly more efficient and effective by simplifying how students and teachers log in. It&#8217;s this simple: imagine if you could give teachers and students 10-15 minutes back in every single class. That&#8217;s 30-40% more time for actual teaching and learning. That&#8217;s what Clever does today, with much more in the works.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m incredibly excited about this new adventure, and I want to gush a bit.</p>
<h3>Priorities</h3>
<p>My priorities in work are:</p>
<ol>
<li>people</li>
<li>mission</li>
<li>product</li>
</ol>
<p>People – strong contributors who know how to work in teams that accomplish more than the sum of their parts – are my top priority. A mission and a product, no matter how good, survive contact with the real world only if backed by strong, honest team players.</p>
<p>A Mission – a clear goal to make a positive, socially beneficial dent in the universe – is my close second priority. Products come and go, pivots happen, but a strong mission gives an organization an invariant, a true north when the storm hits.</p>
<p>And finally, a strong Product. Because once you have great people, and once you have a clear and stable mission, you still need a compelling product to deliver that mission to the market. The product is the last mile of your impact on the world.</p>
<h3>Clever</h3>
<p>Clever meets all three of my priorities in spades.</p>
<p>I am blown away by the quality of people at Clever, starting with co-founders Tyler, Dan, and Rafael, and including every engineer, business-development partner, school experience advocate, recruiter, etc. Clever team members have oodles of education experience, with ex-teachers, ex-DOE, and ex-school-technologists joining hands to build the next-generation education platform. And it&#8217;s not just individual quality and skills, as Clever has also built a strong team culture, one that mirrors the values of the education products we want to see. Every team member is always a student, and Clever is a group effort.</p>
<p>The Clever mission is clear and deeply impactful: to save teacher and students time, all the while protecting student privacy and preserving data access controls enforced by schools.</p>
<p>And finally, the Clever product is catching on like wildfire. There remains a mountain of work because there&#8217;s a mountain of opportunity to make education software better. But the market is already speaking, and Clever has struck a a very clear chord.</p>
<h3>Join Us</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re a growing team of 20&#8217;ish engineers, passionate about applying technology to making K-12 education far more effective. We&#8217;re committing to building a diverse team, because teams with a variety of life experiences build better products, and because darnit it&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Do you like working on code that makes the world a better place? Do you want to learn from and teach your teammates every day? Do you want to work on hard technical problems not just because they&#8217;re hard, but because they&#8217;re hard and impactful?</p>
<p>Clever&#8217;s a unique place and a unique opportunity. Use your powers for good. Send me a note.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friends over at EFF just revealed that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/healthcare.gov-sends-personal-data">Healthcare.gov is sending personal data to dozens of tracking sites</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s especially troubling that the U.S. government is sending personal information to commercial companies on a website that&#8217;s touted as the place for people to obtain health care coverage. Even more troubling is the potential for companies like Doubleclick, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, and others to associate this data with a person&#8217;s actual identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_289563/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=Py6rd7WO">referenced AP story</a> uses even more damning language:</p>
<blockquote><p>The government&#8217;s health insurance website is quietly sending consumers&#8217; personal data to private companies that specialize in advertising and analyzing Internet data for performance and marketing, The Associated Press has learned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds pretty bad, right? Except it&#8217;s almost certainly not what it sounds like. It&#8217;s almost certainly a simple mistake.</p>
<p>How could this be a mistake, you ask? Here&#8217;s what almost certainly happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone at Healthcare.gov wanted to analyze patterns of usage of the site. This is often done to optimize sites for better usage. So they added a tracker to their page for MixPanel, for Optimizely, for Google Analytics, and a couple of other sites that help you understand how people use your site. In all likelihood, different departments added different trackers, each for their own purposes, almost certainly with good intentions of making the web site more usable.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, someone else responsible for social media of HealthCare.gov added a &#8220;Tweet This&#8221; button, and someone else added a YouTube video. Once again, these come in the form of widgets, often snippets of JavaScript code, that load resources from their respective home base.</li>
<li>Separately, someone built the web form that lets you enter basic information about yourself so you can find a health plan. That information is, in large part, fairly personal: your age, your zip code, whether or not you smoke, etc. And for some reason, almost certainly completely random, they used a web form with an action type of GET.</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s the first mildly technical point. When you submit a GET form, the data in the form is appended to the URL, like so:
<pre>https://healthcare.gov/results?zip=12345&amp;gender=male&amp;parent=1&amp;pregnant=1&amp;...</pre>
<p>Not a big deal, since that data is going to Healthcare.gov anyways.</li>
<li>And now for the second mildly technical point. For tracking purposes, trackers often blindly copy the current URL and send it to their homebase, so that the trackers can tell you users spent 5s on this page, then 10s on that page, etc. In addition, when your browser requests an embedded YouTube video, or an embedded tracker, it sends the current URL as part of the request in a so-called Referrer field.</li>
<li>Put those two technical points together, and <strong>boom</strong>: a web site that collects personal information with GET forms and uses third-party tracking widgets tends to send form data to those third parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is extremely common. Many web sites with sufficiently large engineering teams have no idea how many trackers they&#8217;ve embedded. It&#8217;s typical for a web site to move from one site analysis tool to another and to forget to remove the first tracking widget in the process. When the Wall Street Journal reported on these issues a couple of years ago with their fantastic <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/what-they-know-digital-privacy.html">What They Know</a> series, they forgot to mention that their own page has a half-dozen trackers embedded.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again: unfortunately, <a href="https://benlog.com/2011/04/28/your-information-wants-to-be-free/">your information wants to be free</a>. My favorite analogy remains:</p>
<blockquote><p>when building a skyscraper, workers are constantly fighting gravity. One moment of inattention, and a steel beam can fall from the 50th floor, turning a small oversight into a tragedy. The same goes for software systems and data breaches. The natural state of data is to be copied, logged, transmitted, stored, and stored again. It takes constant fighting and vigilance to prevent that breach. It takes <em>privacy and security engineering</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, am I letting Healthcare.gov off the hook? Not at all, they should have done their due diligence and done a more thorough privacy audit. And using GET forms is particularly sloppy, since it leads to data sprayed all over the place in logs, referrers, etc.</p>
<p>But was this a deliberate attempt at sharing private data with private companies? Not a chance. The press should do a better job of reporting this stuff. And, to my wonderful friends at EFF, this is a gentle nudge to say: so should you. It&#8217;s important to differentiate between negligence and malice, to not spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt, even when it&#8217;s issues we care about.</p>
<p>The good news is that HealthCare.gov has already responded by (a) reducing their number of trackers significantly and (b) submitting form data using XMLHttpRequest or POST. The bad news is how many people now actually believe that this was intentional, conspiratorial data selling. If that was Healthcare.gov&#8217;s intentions, there are much sneakier ways of doing that without getting caught so easily.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you want to understand more about trackers and block them as you surf the web, try the very excellent <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/en/">Ghostery</a> extension for your browser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This holiday, I finally spent time digging into how I manage photos and videos. With 2 young kids and some remote family and friends, this requires a good bit of thinking and planning. I know I&#8217;m not the only one, so I figured documenting where I landed might be useful to others.</p>
<p>I started with Dave Liggat&#8217;s <a href="http://liggat.org/2014/03/20/a-robust-photo-workflow/">Robust Photo Workflow</a>, and found much of it resonates with my needs. Here&#8217;s where I landed:</p>
<ol>
<li>I take photos with a DSLR and two phones. My wife takes photos with her phone. We both take videos with our phones. We use Dropbox/Carousel auto-upload, which works just fine on both iOS and Android. For the DSLR, I manually load photos over USB.</li>
<p></p>
<li>All photos and videos are now available on my desktop Mac (via USB or Dropbox). When I&#8217;m ready to review/edit photos, I drag and drop the batch into an all-photos/ directory I keep within my Dropbox.</li>
<p></p>
<li><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> automatically categorizes photos and videos into subdirectories of the form 2015/01/. It&#8217;s really kind of awesome.</li>
<p></p>
<li>all-photos and all-videos are thus simple date-classified folders of all of my photos and videos. They&#8217;re backed up locally using Time Machine. They&#8217;re backed up to the network using Dropbox. I can imagine eventually snapshotting this to Amazon S3/Glacier, but right now that doesn&#8217;t feel too urgent.</li>
<p></p>
<li>I use Lightroom5 as an editor only, so if I blow away my Lightroom proprietary catalog info, it&#8217;s not that big a deal. To do this, I tell Lightroom to look at photos in all-photos without moving/copying them. After I&#8217;ve added a bunch of photos to the all-photos directory by drag-and-drop, I tell Lightroom to synchronize its catalog with the source folder, which takes a few seconds and gives me a screen with my latest imported photos and videos. I can then edit photos, reject them if they&#8217;re bad, and write back JPG/XMP data to each photo&#8217;s originating directory using Lightroom export. Dropbox backs those up automatically. To remove bad photos (blurry, etc.), I flag them as &#8220;rejected&#8221; in Lightroom using the X key, and when I&#8217;m done I command-delete, which gives me the option of removing the files from disk, too. I do this only for clear rejects, and it makes my mild OCD happy since I know I am not keeping totally useless files around, and the overhead of deleting photos is low. I could also delete photos easily using the Dropbox UI, which is pretty good, and then re-synchronize in Lightroom.</li>
<p></p>
<li>I can then use Carousel (or Dropbox) on any mobile device to browse through all of my photos. It&#8217;s surprisingly good at dealing with large photo libraries (I have 20K) and large photos (I have a bunch of 13MP photos). As in, really, really good, even on a puny phone. Better than anything else I&#8217;ve seen.</li>
<p></p>
<li>I&#8217;ve been using Flickr for years for private photo sharing, and Lightroom is really good at exporting to Flickr. That said, at this point I&#8217;m thinking of moving to Dropbox/Carousel based sharing. I can easily bundle photos &amp; videos into albums on Dropbox, whereas videos are still limited on Flickr. Carousel conversations around a few photos are great with family. The only bummer is that Carousel and Dropbox have some mutually exclusive features: albums on Dropbox, conversations on Carousel. I suspect Dropbox will fix that in the next year.</li>
<p></p>
<li>What I&#8217;d love to see:
<ul>
<li>unified photo features in Dropbox and Carousel</li>
<li>export Dropbox albums as directories of symlinks in my Dropbox folder, and export Carousel conversations in some other file-based way, too.</li>
<li>Lightroom export compatibility with Dropbox/Carousel albums.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m super happy with this new process: one funnel, easy, low overhead, and a very solid long-term photo storage solution. I&#8217;m only relying on RAW/JPG files and directories of said files to be readable for the long term, and that seems pretty safe. Lightroom is awesome, but I could replace it with a different tool if I needed to.</p>
<p>One more thing: if you&#8217;re going to use Dropbox to store all of your photos, make sure you pick a strong password and set up 2-factor authentication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So there&#8217;s this hot new app called <a href="https://www.secret.ly/">Secret</a>. The app is really clever: it prompts you to share secrets, and it sends those secrets to your social circle. It doesn&#8217;t identify you directly to your friends. Instead, it tells readers that this secret was written by one of their friends without identifying which one. The popularity of the app appears to be off the charts, with significant venture-capital investment in a short period of time. There are amazing stories of people seeking out emotional support on Secret, and awful stories of bullying that have caused <a href="http://pando.com/2014/07/31/investors-have-to-stop-trying-to-justify-the-lies-and-libel-of-secret/">significant uproar</a>. Secret has <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/an-anonymous-social-app-tries-to-clean-up-its-act/">recently released features aimed at curbing bullying</a>.</p>
<p>My sense is that the commentary to date is missing the mark. There&#8217;s talk of the danger of anonymous speech. Even the founders of Secret <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/08/05/anonymous-apps-may-be-troubling-but-are-they-unethical-secret-defends-its-approach/">talk about their app like it&#8217;s anonymous speech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Anonymity is a really powerful thing, and with that power comes great responsibility. Figuring out these issues is the key to our long-term success, but it’s a hard, hard problem and we are doing the best we can.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And this is certainly true: we&#8217;ve known for a while that anonymous speech can reveal the worst in people. But that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re dealing with here. Posts on Secret are not anonymous. Posts on Secret are <em><strong>guaranteed to be authored by one of your friends</strong></em>. That guarantee is enabled and relayed by the Secret platform. That&#8217;s a very different beast than anonymity.</p>
<p>In general, if you seek good behavior, Power and Accountability need to be connected: the more Power you give someone, the more you hold them Accountable. Anonymity can be dangerous because it removes Accountability. That said, anonymity also removes some Power: if you&#8217;re not signing your name to your statement, it carries less weight. With Secret, Accountability is absent, just like with anonymous speech, but <em><strong>the power of identified speech remains in full force</strong></em>. That leads to amazing positive experiences: people can share thoughts of suicide with friends who can help, all under the cloak of group-anonymity that is both protecting and empowering. And it leads to disastrous power granted to bullies attacking their victims with the full force of speaking with authority – the bully is one of their friends! – while carrying zero accountability. That kind of power is likely to produce more bullies, too.</p>
<p>This is so much more potent that anonymity. And if this fascinating experiment is to do more good than harm, it will need to seriously push the envelope on systems for Accountability that are on par with the power Secret grants.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a free idea, straight out of crypto land. In cryptographic protocols that combine a need for good behavior with privacy/anonymity protections, there is often a trigger where bad behavior removes the anonymity shield. What if Secret revealed the identity of those users found to be in repeated violation of a code of good behavior? Would the threat of potential shame keep people in line, leaving the good uses intact while disincentivizing the destructive ones?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lessig.org">Larry Lessig</a> just launched <a href="http://mayone.us">MayOne.us</a>, the SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs. The idea is disarmingly simple: since SuperPACs funded by billionaires are corrupting politics, let&#8217;s crowd-source a SuperPAC funded by individuals, which will then work to put in power officials who answer to the people, maybe by undoing the whole SuperPAC insanity. Use a SuperPAC to kill all SuperPACs.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating pattern that we&#8217;ve actually seen before. And it makes me very, very happy, because it is the ultimate policy hack.</p>
<p>Take the GPL or the Apache License, two significant software licenses that make possible open-source and thus much of today&#8217;s software. These licenses, especially the GPL, enforce certain constraints on how source code can be used. If you take GPL source code, modify it, and redistribute it, you have to provide the source code to your modifications, too. If you don&#8217;t&#8230; you lose your license on the code to begin with, and <em>now you&#8217;re guilty of copyright violation</em> because you redistributed code without permission.</p>
<p>In other words, many open-source licenses work <em>only because they leverage strong copyright law</em>. The same goes for <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>: you can freely license your work while requiring that people give you credit for it, or, if you prefer, only if they use it for non-commercial purposes. The only reason you can add those constraints is because Creative Commons is layered on top of Copyright. Some people believe Copyright Law has overreached. Those same people are using that Copyright overreach as a foundation for a stronger Commons.</p>
<p>The GPL, Creative Commons, and now MayOne basically use the overreach of the system against itself.</p>
<p>I find this idea – that an unnaturally strong system of rules can be counter-balanced by using the system against itself – fascinating and kind of awesome. Are there other areas where this can be applied?</p>
<p>But before I digress: go pledge to <a href="https://mayone.us">MayOne.us</a>. Let&#8217;s make SuperPACs eat themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stepping into a heated debate within the nation’s transportation safety agencies, President Obama has decided that when the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) discovers major flaws in transportation equipment, it should — in most circumstances — reveal them to assure that they will be fixed, rather than keep mum so that the flaws can be used in espionage, senior administration officials said Saturday.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" style="color:#333333;">But Mr. Obama carved a broad exception for “a clear national security or law enforcement need,” the officials said, a loophole that is likely to allow the NTSB to continue to exploit safety flaws to apprehend terrorist suspects as they go about their daily routines such as driving.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" style="color:#333333;">On Friday, the White House denied that it had any prior knowledge of the AirBleed defect, a newly discovered safety vulnerability in commonly used Michelin tires that often leads to spontaneous tire explosion when driving for prolonged periods of time at exactly 44mph. This flaw has led many manufacturers to urgently recall cars and many drivers to behave erratically in 45mph speed zones. The White House statement said that when such flaws are discovered, there is now a “bias” in the government to share that knowledge with car and tire manufacturers, so a remedy can be created and distributed to industry and consumers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" style="color:#333333;">Sources indicate that some senior officials had urged the NTSB to get out of the business of weakening commercial transportation systems or trying to build in “trapdoor failures” that would make it far easier for the agency to intercept suspected terrorists. These officials concluded that the practice would undercut trust in the American auto industry. In recent months, Detroit has urged the United States to abandon such practices, while Germany and Japan, among other nations, have said they were considering pulling all auto production facilities back to their own countries.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" style="color:#333333;">Not surprisingly, officials at the NTSB and at its military partner, the United States Special Operations Command, warned that giving up the capability to exploit undisclosed safety flaws in widespread commercial equipment would amount to “unilateral disarmament” — a phrase taken from the battles over whether and how far to cut America’s nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" style="color:#333333;">When interviewed at his home in Maryland, John Smith, head of the NTSB in the 1980s, appeared incredulous: &#8220;Do you mean to tell me that the American Government knew about widespread life-threatening safety issues in our cars and chose not to disclose those findings to its citizens, just in case this weakness could be used to go after a presumed terrorist? I don&#8217;t believe it. The US government serves its people first, and never in a conspiracy-theorist&#8217;s wildest dreams would they engage in such despicable behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>[a light parody of <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/us/politics/obama-lets-nsa-exploit-some-internet-flaws-officials-say.html">this New York Times Article</a></em>.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in the middle of writing a blog post about the controversy surrounding Mozilla when my Twitter feed exploded with the news that <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/04/03/brendan-eich-steps-down-as-mozilla-ceo/">Brendan Eich stepped down from his new appointment as Mozilla CEO</a>. So this is a different post. Also, this is not a post about Prop8 (which I abhored) or gay marriage (which I consider a basic civil right.)</p>
<h3>to Brendan</h3>
<p>There is little love lost between me and Brendan. We have different styles, and I butted heads with him in tech discussions on a regular basis while I was at Mozilla. He was, at times, infuriating. To be honest, he drove me up the wall.</p>
<p>Yet through all of these disagreements and conflicts, one thing was never in doubt: Brendan has the Mozilla mission of inclusiveness, openness, and freedom engrained in his heart. This is a man who has tirelessly worked in the open for close to 20 years, giving up riches at other companies so he could create an open playground for the world to use, a counter-balance to corporate interests on the Web, and opportunity for billions, even if they never know his name.</p>
<p>So Brendan, thank you, for everything you&#8217;ve done for the Open Web and for Humanity. The world is in your debt. You can take the man out of Mozilla, but you can never take the Mozilla mission out of the man.</p>
<h3>to my friends at Mozilla</h3>
<p>Some people love Mozilla for its mission, but much of the world doesn&#8217;t get it. People use Firefox because they like it; others use a different browser because they like that one better. I don&#8217;t think that will ever really change. It&#8217;s easy to become very depressed about this, to think &#8220;how can people be so harsh on Mozilla when we&#8217;ve been such good citizens?&#8221; or &#8220;can&#8217;t people see that Firefox is the only browser built by a non-profit?&#8221; People don&#8217;t care as much as they should. One bad PR cycle might be enough for them to switch browsers.</p>
<p>I want to suggest that this apathy can be empowering: don&#8217;t count on others groking the mission. Follow the Mozilla mission on your own terms, because <em>you</em> know it&#8217;s the right thing to do. Do the right thing because it is the right thing.</p>
<p>Keep doing the right thing, friends, and be excellent to each other.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first open-source contribution was in 1998, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArsDigita">a ragtag bunch of web hackers and I</a> published the first version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArsDigita_Community_System">one of the first web application toolkits</a>. In 2000, after I&#8217;d left the original project, <a href="http://openacs.org">a few other hackers and I</a> &#8220;forked&#8221; that codebase to make it work on an open-source database, meaning we took the code, copied it to a different repository, and took it down a different path than that envisioned by its maintainers.</p>
<p>That has always been the beauty of open-source: if you don&#8217;t like the direction of the software, you can always fork it. The dirty little secret of open-source at the time was that this was much more an abstract threat than a common occurrence. Forking was almost always a bad word, a huge undertaking, and it happened very rarely. One central reason for this was that forking was almost always a one-way street: once you forked, it became very difficult to share improvements between forks.</p>
<p>So, in theory, thanks to open-source licenses, forking was always possible. In practice, it was a huge undertaking, one with deep consequences, and usually a sign of something gone awry.</p>
<p>Then in 2008 came <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. Github made hosting source code super easy. Github made forking other people&#8217;s code super easy, too. And thanks to the underlying Git system, Github made merging just as easy as forking. Within a few weeks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Statistics">more than 6200 projects on Github had been forked at least once</a>.</p>
<p>Forking became the optimistic way to contribute to a project: fork it, modify it for your own use, and suggest the change back to the original author. If the original author accepts your change, great, you can forget about your fork and go back to using the original code. If the author rejects your change, you can keep using your forked version, occasionally merging in upstream changes from the original author.</p>
<p>So forking became a good thing, a sign of interest in your project. People wore &#8220;Fork Me&#8221; t-shirts. And it was all done for years with little attention paid to the specifics of the licenses underlying it all. It was just assumed that, if you made a Github project public, you allowed open-source style forking.</p>
<p>In many ways, Github made real what open-source licenses mostly theorized. Standing on the shoulders of giants, contributing just a little tweak very easily, taking a different direction when you need to, etc. All the beauty of a vast open repository of code you can pick from and contribute to exists in Github.</p>
<p>And somehow, this amazing sharing ecosystem is based on purely selfish incentives. I need to host my code. I don&#8217;t like paying for things unless I need to, so I&#8217;ll make it public, because Github makes me pay for private repositories. I sometimes need to change other people&#8217;s code, and there&#8217;s a button for that. If someone changes my code I&#8217;d like to benefit from it, and there&#8217;s a button for that, too.</p>
<p>Like the Back-to-the-Future deLorean that runs on garbage, Github produces sharing behavior by consuming selfish acts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see many other Githubs. And I know startups are pitching Github-like projects to VCs daily. But it&#8217;s not just about a place to host and remix stuff. The magic of Github is that it generated a sharing ecosystem out of selfish incentives. Not sharing and selfishness side by side. Not questionable sharing of private content for the sake of virality. Sharing as a true side-effect of selfish behavior.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not easy. And if it can be done in fields other than source code&#8230; I really like what that could do to benefit human knowledge and progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, French taxis went on strike because the government passed a law that made Uber and other modern chauffeur equivalents artificially less competitive&#8230; but apparently not sufficiently less competitive, and that was a tragedy that only a massive strike could rectify. Then when people jumped into Uber cars because, hey, there were no cabs, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/13/5303344/uber-car-attacked-as-paris-taxi-strike-turns-violent">those cars were attacked</a>, leaving some passengers bleeding and stranded on the side of the road.</p>
<p>If you go read the French press, these assaults on completely innocent people are footnotes. &#8220;Incidents.&#8221; &#8220;Scuffles.&#8221; It&#8217;s enough to make your blood boil, really, that no one other than Uber executives seems to be particularly offended.</p>
<p>And this is typical, really. Strikes in France are often launched over ludicrous demands, and they&#8217;re incredibly disruptive if not downright dangerous. Many people in France will tell you how much they hate the incredibly powerful unions and the strikes they engender. But that&#8217;s just how it is. Because strikes are, to many, the essence of French rights, the core of what made French society, at least in the past, an exemplar of workers&#8217; rights against the oppressive corporations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the same week, a man got shot in a Florida movie theater, apparently because he was texting and that got someone really annoyed. The press wrote &#8220;man killed over texting in a movie theater,&#8221; and the discussion was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/14/us/florida-theater-shooting-reaction/">often about how annoying texting can be</a>. Because guns don&#8217;t kill people. Texting in a movie theater&#8230; now that kills!</p>
<p>Never mind that in the year since the Sandy Hook school shooting, where more than a dozen 6-year-olds were shot (6 year-olds! come on!), we&#8217;ve done exactly nothing as a country to contain gun violence. Stupid fights escalate into shootings. Because Second Amendment! I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s what the Founders had in mind when they wanted a &#8220;well-regulated militia&#8221;: people in movie theaters with guns to settle fights.</p>
<p>Guns are such a deep part of America&#8217;s identity that their inherent goodness cannot be challenged. Even if many Americans wish they could change things. It doesn&#8217;t happen. It&#8217;s too engrained in American culture.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know, these two things are not quite the same.</p>
<p>But in a really critical way, they are. We humans make stupid decisions, and I mean really stupid, because some things feel, on principle, like deep parts of our identity. Because at one point in the past, in theory, that thing was really, really important. It&#8217;s the insane thing you hold on to because, if you give it up, it feels like you&#8217;re giving up a piece of yourself, like you&#8217;re renouncing who you really are.</p>
<p>So. What&#8217;s <em>your</em> stupid cause you feel you must stick to lest you betray yourself? How is it stopping you from seeing the obvious mistake you&#8217;re making? Can you let go of it and accept that yes, you are still the same person? I ask myself that, every now and then.</p>
<p>Because we primates sure are irrational.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we use terminology that is too broad, too coarse-grained, we make discussion more difficult. That sounds obvious, but it&#8217;s easy to miss in practice. We&#8217;ve made this mistake in spades with crypto. Discussing the field as one broad topic is counter-productive and leads to needless bickering.</p>
<p>I see 3 major kinds of crypto: <b>b2c crypto</b>, <b>b2b crypto</b>, and <b>p2p crypto</b>. I suggest that we use this terminology consistently to help guide the discussion. We&#8217;ll spend less time talking about differences in our assumptions, and more time building better solutions.</p>
<h4>b2c crypto</h4>
<p>Business-to-Customer Crypto (b2c) is used to secure the relationship between an organization and a typical user. The user roughly trusts the organization, and the goal of b2c crypto is to enable that trust by keeping attackers out of that relationship. Both the organization and the user want to know that they&#8217;re talking to each other and not to an impostor. The organization is usually acting like an honest-but-curious party: they&#8217;ll mostly do what they promise. The b2c-crypto relationship is common between Internet service providers (in the broad sense, including Google, Amazon, etc.) and typical Internet users, as well as between employees and their employer&#8217;s IT department.</p>
<p>Web-browser SSL is a great example of b2c crypto. Users start with a computer that has at least one web browser with a set of root certs. Users can continue using that browser or download, over SSL secured by those initial root certs, another browser they trust more. Users then trust their preferred browser&#8217;s security indicators when they shop on Amazon or read their Gmail.</p>
<p>A critical feature of b2c crypto is that users don&#8217;t ever manage crypto keys. At best they manage a password, and even then they&#8217;re generally able to reset it. Users make trust decisions based on brands and hopefully clear security indicators: I want a Mac, I want to use Firefox, and I want to shop on Amazon but only when I see the green lock icon.</p>
<h4>b2b crypto</h4>
<p>Business-to-Business (b2b) crypto is used to secure the relationship between organizations, two or more at a time. There are two defining characteristics of b2b crypto:</p>
<ul>
<li> all participants are expected to manage crypto keys</li>
<li> end-users are generally not involved or burdened</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.dkim.org/">DKIM</a> is a good example of b2b crypto. Organizations sign their outgoing emails and verify signatures on incoming emails. Spam and phishing are reduced, and end-users see only the positive result without being involved in the process. Organizations must maintain secret cryptographic keys for signing those emails and know how to publish their public keys (usually in DNS) to inform other organizations.</p>
<p><a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> qualifies as b2b crypto. Consumers and Producers of Web APIs establish shared secret credentials and use them to secure API calls between organizations.</p>
<p>Another good example is SSL certificate issuance. Both the web site seeking a certificate and the Certificate Authority have to generate and secure secret keys. The complexity of the certification process is mostly hidden from end-users.</p>
<h4>p2p crypto</h4>
<p>Peer-to-Peer (p2p) crypto is used to secure communication between two or more crypto-savvy individuals. The defining characteristic of p2p crypto is that the crypto-savvy individuals trust no one by default. They tend to run code locally, manage crypto keys, and assume all intermediaries are active attackers.</p>
<p>PGP is a great example of p2p crypto. Everyone generates a keypair, and by default no one trusts anyone else. Emails are encrypted and signed, and if you lose your secret key, you&#8217;re out of luck.</p>
<h4>so how does this help?</h4>
<p>This naming scheme provides a clear shorthand for delineating crypto solutions. Is your wonderful crypto solution targeted at the general public? Then it&#8217;s probably a combination of b2c crypto for users and b2b crypto for organizations that support them. Are you building a specialized communications platform for journalists in war zones? Then it&#8217;s probably p2p crypto.</p>
<p>The implementation techniques we use for various kinds of crypto differ. So when some folks write that <a href="http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/">Javascript Crypto is considered harmful</a>, I can easily respond &#8220;yes, dynamically-loaded Javascript is a poor approach for p2p crypto, but it&#8217;s great for b2c crypto.&#8221; In fact, when you look closely at <a href="http://tonyarcieri.com/whats-wrong-with-webcrypto">a similar criticism of Javascript crypto from Tony Arcieri</a>, you see this same differentiation, only with much more verbiage because we don&#8217;t have clear terminology:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Before I keep talking about where in-browser cryptography is inappropriate, let me talk about where I think it might work: I think it has great potential uses for encrypting messages sent between a user and the web site they are accessing. For example, my former employer LivingSocial used in-browser crypto to encrypt credit card numbers in-browser with their payment processor’s public key before sending them over the wire (via an HTTPS connection which effectively double-encrypted them). This provided end-to-end encryption between a user’s browser and the LivingSocial’s upstream payment gateway, even after HTTPS has been terminated by LivingSocial (i.e. all cardholder data seen by LivingSocial was encrypted).
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very good thing. It&#8217;s the kind of defense that can prevent the likes of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/target-40m-card-accounts-may-breached-115232188--finance.html">the attack against Target&#8217;s 40M customers</a> last month. And that&#8217;s exactly the point of b2c crypto.</p>
<h4>most users can&#8217;t manage crypto keys</h4>
<p>I use the term <em>p2p crypto</em> because I like to think of it as &#8220;Pro-to-Pro.&#8221; Expecting typical Internet users to engage in p2p crypto is, in my opinion, a pipe dream: typical users can&#8217;t manage secret crypto keys, so typical users must rely on organizations to do that for them. That&#8217;s why successful general-public crypto is a combination of b2c crypto between individuals and the organizations they choose to trust, and b2b crypto across organizations. More expertise and care is expected of the organizations, little is expected of individual users, and <em>some trust</em> is assumed between a user and the organizations they choose.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to agree with me on this point to agree with the nomenclature. If you&#8217;re interested in protocols where individuals manage their own secret keys and don&#8217;t trust intermediaries, you&#8217;re interested in p2p crypto. I happen to think that p2p crypto is applicable only to some users and some specific situations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, my wife and I hosted our 10th Thanksgiving. We both enjoy cooking and baking, though we remain clearly amateurs and tend to make it up as we go along. There was that one time we realized, the night before Thanksgiving, that a frozen 15-pound turkey requires 3 days to defrost in the fridge. I stayed up most of the night, soaking the bird in the bathtub.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve gotten better over time: she focuses on stuffing and cranberry sauce, me on turkey and dessert, and we collaborate on some kind of sweet potato dish. The stress almost always comes around how long to roast the turkey and whether it&#8217;s fully cooked. For the last 4 years, we&#8217;ve had the added (but wonderful) complexity of little kids eager to eat. We had great luck once with a high-heat plus start-breast-side-down combination, but we were never able to recreate that success.</p>
<p>This year, I reached out on twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>alright. I&#039;m looking for an awesome high-heat &amp; flip-halfway turkey recipe I remember from a couple years ago, but can no longer find. Help!</p>
<p>&mdash; Ben Adida (@benadida) <a href="https://twitter.com/benadida/statuses/405550929803350016">November 27, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I received this recommendation from a former student and fellow web hacker:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benadida">@benadida</a> google &quot;spatchcock turkey&quot;; I kid you not. Spatchcocking will change your life.</p>
<p>&mdash; Ian Spivey (@ispivey) <a href="https://twitter.com/ispivey/statuses/405551961165930496">November 27, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;What in the world is spatchcocking,&#8221; I thought. I was ready to try it after this video:</p>
<div class="embed-youtube"><iframe title="How to Spatchcock Your Thanksgiving Turkey" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E2Lie172c3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>(The New York Times also has a nice <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/dining/100000002547372/how-to-spatchcock-a-turkey.html">take on the technique</a>.)</p>
<p>Roughly, spatchcocking involves cutting out the turkey&#8217;s backbone, then breaking open the bird and laying it out flat. One layer of meat, all on the same plane, with the dark meat slightly protecting the white meat, which is what you want since white meat cooks faster. The technique promises shorter cook times, more even cooking, and juicier meat.</p>
<p>Turns out, it&#8217;s all absolutely true. Preparation was easy and eminently repeatable, with little risk of screwing things up. The bird cooked in about 2 hours, where typically it would have required 4. The whole turkey cooked at the same speed. The result: amazing fully cooked dark meat, juicy white meat, perfectly crispy skin, and plenty of oven time left for an apple pie and stuffing. Everyone at the table agreed: this was the best turkey I&#8217;ve ever cooked by far. Even the little kids ate triple portions.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the downside? Well, people claim there are two: (a) you can&#8217;t stuff the turkey and (b) you can&#8217;t present a typical, whole roasted turkey. Instead you&#8217;ve got a weird flat thing that indicates you got really angry in the kitchen. Neither of these matters to me, and I&#8217;ll go out on a limb and say they should matter little to most people: stuffing a raw turkey significantly increases the risk of food poisoning, and, as it turns out, being forced to carve the turkey before presenting it made serving the meal much easier.</p>
<p>So, first lesson: I will only cook spatchcock turkeys from now on.</p>
<p>And second lesson: even after 10 years of doing something, it&#8217;s still possible to find a solution that is faster, simpler, and better, with no real downsides. What&#8217;s crazy is that the solution is already out there, used by some, just not widely. Crazier still is that many people know about it, they just refuse to try it because there are &#8220;downsides&#8221; or the solution is unusual.</p>
<p>But what if the downsides are rhetorical at best? What if it&#8217;s really all upside?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but link this to software engineering and problem-solving more broadly. There are so many technical solutions we simply accept as necessary and necessarily hard. We fail to search for simpler solutions, even when they already exist. Or if we know about them, we choose to ignore them because they seem too simple, too good to be true. We make up excuses, we make up theoretical downsides.</p>
<p>Why not stick to simple? There&#8217;s not necessarily a real tradeoff. Sometimes, even often, you can do faster, simpler, and better. I&#8217;m going to work to keep that in mind in everything I do. Kindergarden selection for my kids. Financial planning. And especially software.</p>
<p>Before going complicated, have you tried spatchcocking? The result might just be delicious.</p>
