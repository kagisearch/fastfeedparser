<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I know what you&#8217;re thinking.  &#8220;David Benoit?! We&#8217;ve waited a year for a record review and it&#8217;s David Benoit?!?  What the heck is Tarik doing writing about HIM?!&#8221;  Weeeeell hold on there.  This may seem out of place, and this is definitely the most recently-recorded music I&#8217;ve written about so far on my humble blog, but this record is major to me on a personal and musical level.  With that, let&#8217;s dive into this.  To the music!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Tune:  &#8220;Waiting For Spring&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/02-my-romance.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Tune:  &#8220;My Romance&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Recorded:  5 February &amp; 25 May, 1989 in Hollywood, CA</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Personnel:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Emily Remler:  Guitar</li>



<li>David Benoit:  Piano</li>



<li>Luther Hughes:  Bass</li>



<li>Peter Erskine:  Drums</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I don&#8217;t mind sharing that until a year or two ago, I had no idea who Emily Remler was.  This despite owning this album for almost 20 years.  Briefly, Ms. Remler took the jazz world by storm in the 1980&#8217;s, garnering praise from jazz guitar greats like Herb Ellis and Jim Hall.  Her main influences were Paul Desmond (!!!!!!), guitarist Pat Martino, and significantly Wes Montgomery, making for a heck of unique sound a collective influence that haunts much of the proceedings on this record. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As for David Benoit, he holds a special place in my heart and in my life in general.  It was a Benoit CD, an album dedicated to Guaraldi&#8217;s Charlie Brown tunes, that my mother bought for me (at Best Buy of all places.  It truly was a different era) when I was little kid.  It was the first real jazz album (not a mixtape burned by my father) that I owned, and it in turn introduced me to Vince Guaraldi, which in turn got me truly hooked.  Playing that Benoit CD 24/7, my dad dug out Benoit&#8217;s earlier album, &#8216;Waiting For Spring&#8217;.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t actually intend to give me the CD, but I never returned it.  I loved it, and memorized the thing in no time flat.  As I got older and explored Benoit&#8217;s discography, I quickly discovered that much of his stuff wasn&#8217;t my cup of tea (electric, 1980s, etc.), but this acoustic album remained a favorite.  Remler&#8217;s guitar is sublime, Benoit&#8217;s playing is tasty, and their song choices/writing is perfect.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The title track, for instance, is a wonderful bit of writing.  Sounding like a spring morning, &#8220;Waiting For Spring&#8221; begins softly and cool but progressively heats up.  The interplay between all four musicians during Remler&#8217;s solo is fun yet subtle, stimulating Remler in the process.  For Benoit&#8217;s solo, however, the bassist begins to walk and the drummer recedes to a supportive background role, and gradually the heat gets turned up.  By the time they restate the melody, they&#8217;re swinging even harder.  Like any good opening tune, &#8220;Waiting For Spring&#8221; set the bar high for the rest of the record.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Consequently, it set the bar impossibly high for one tune in particular.  Along with &#8220;Summertime&#8221;, I cannot stand the song &#8220;My Romance&#8221;.  Maybe it&#8217;s the rather nondescript melody, the basic chords behind the nondescript melody, or (most-likely) the saccharine treatment this song seems to get.  What I do know is that after hearing Benoit&#8217;s version of &#8220;My Romance&#8221; in 2002, every other version has yet to do what their version did for me.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Even with Benoit&#8217;s rubato opening, he doesn&#8217;t belabor the point.  He states the melody beautifully, then goes into a coda that establishes the beat.  Then, Remler comes in with her scrumptious chorded guitar to again state the melody, all while the drummer lays it down with the brushes.  Again, there&#8217;s no &#8220;isn&#8217;t this gorgeous&#8221; sentimentality to the playing; they&#8217;re playing it and then they&#8217;re swinging it.  Even the bass solo is hip, especially the way he wraps it up and walks into the next chorus.  Well done.  But possibly my favorite part is the extended vamp that Benoit and Remler use to play the tune out, jamming on a four-bar coda and trading fours as the engineer fades to black.  Perfection.  Nearly every other version I&#8217;ve heard treats the tune with almost <em>TOO</em> much respect.  Benoit and company don&#8217;t, and that earns <em>MY</em> respect.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The rest of the music on the album is solidly in the tradition of great jazz piano.  In fact, the album is a tribute of sorts to two jazz pianists.  Bill Evans had just passed away when this record was made, inspiring Benoit to include tunes associated with the great pianist like Evans&#8217; compositions &#8220;Funkallero&#8221; and &#8220;Turn Out The Stars&#8221;, as well as &#8220;My Romance&#8221;.  But Benoit also included a tune from Vince Guaraldi, his hit tune &#8220;Cast Your Fate To The Wind&#8221;, and it&#8217;s another example of Benoit having his own way with a done-to-death tune and making it sound fresh as a result.   </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">All in all, this is a great album and one that may surprise some jazz heads accustomed to ignoring jazz recorded during the 1980s.  I&#8217;ll admit that David Benoit&#8217;s body of music doesn&#8217;t always let on that the man could swing, but when he put himself in the right settings, he could turn in some head-turning (and head-bobbing) performances. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"> Raggy Waltz Rating: B</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Considering the down-right hideous artwork endemic to jazz record albums during the 1970&#8217;s-90&#8217;s, it&#8217;s somewhat miraculous that the artwork on this album isn&#8217;t worse than it is.  For instance, in what may be the biggest shocker of all, the artwork is actually relevant to the music!  With the atmospheric album title, the photograph perfectly matches the record&#8217;s concept and the music within.  The lone bench, piled high with snow, seems to be waiting for spring and the opportunity to be used by park-goers once again.  The blue titling and the sparse white space underlines the wintery feeling.  Bravo.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Taken up mostly with credits, there is a concise poem buried towards the bottom by Mr. Benoit himself that again perfectly syncs with the music.  Even the portrait of Benoit is tastefully done.  And yes, I left the shrink wrap on.  I don&#8217;t feel as strongly about it either way as some people do, I suppose.  Sometimes I remove, other times I leave it on.  I&#8217;ll probably remove it at some point.  But for now, it remains.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Please excuse the few seconds of dead vinyl on the first tune before the tune actually starts.  I did that to make sure you knew it was in fact from the record and not digital.  It sounds that clean.  I also recorded that first track awful hot, so the clips you hear are my fault, not the actual record&#8217;s. The vinyl itself is typical from the era, thin and bendy but quiet and of good quality.  The labels are pretty basic, although the logo for GRP is kinda neat.  Don&#8217;t tell anybody, but it was *digitally* recorded and *digitally* mastered.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Released in 1989 during the overlap period when vinyl was on it&#8217;s way out and CDs were taking the country by storm, GRP released this album on both formats.  After having owned the CD first, I was shocked to discover that the record left off not one but two tunes that were on the CD.  Interestingly, there&#8217;s no mention of this omission on the album.  If you didn&#8217;t know, then I guess you just didn&#8217;t know.  Undoubtedly due to limited space on the vinyl, those two missing tracks illustrated why CDs were taking over as the musical format of choice.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Place of Acquisition</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Looking back, it becomes more and more incredible how I and my friends all met up in Atlanta, Georgia in February of 2020 merely weeks before the world changed due to Covid.  We all went to Criminal Records, a place I have a love-hate relationship with, and among the interesting things found was this album.  There was some incredulity when my friends saw how excited I was (&#8220;all that for David Benoit?&#8221;), but I was fine with it.  After years of disappointing buys at Criminal Records, this record is a rare example of a purchase from there that I was completely happy with.  Ironically, the record&#8217;s title became uncomfortably accurate about three weeks later.  It took a few years, but spring finally did come, allowing us all to venture back outside after a year or so of cabin fever. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As I said in my previous post, I&#8217;ve been hanging around the Bay Area of California for the summer, roaming the hospital halls by night and the record store rows by day.  It has been way too much fun digging for records in these new areas, and oh the gold I&#8217;ve found!  Regular readers know that I tend to focus on West Coast-affiliated jazz, which especially translates to the things I look for when I go record shopping.  Being in Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco, the land where Brubeck, Desmond, Tjader, Guaraldi, and Fantasy Records all dwelled, I&#8217;ve especially been keeping an eye out for those records.  I haven&#8217;t been disappointed.  At all.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">So, to start (or restart, technically) this series spotlighting the various places I&#8217;ve been, I thought I&#8217;d write about a place that&#8217;s well-known but just happened to have a record that isn&#8217;t well-known at all.  Coincidentally, it&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve been looking for for a while.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ironically, I&#8217;m actually not a big fan of Amoeba.  I went once many moons ago and although I did find quite a few interesting things there, I thought the way they priced and sometimes even wrapped their albums was rather odd.  And it&#8217;s huge.  And it&#8217;s always packed with people.  It&#8217;s a trendy place, apparently, which means that there&#8217;s always a crowd.  Luckily, the jazz section is almost always empty, but you gotta wade through the folks to get there.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As for the kinds of things there, Amoeba stocks their bins with a very healthy quantity of new things.  Modern reissues, modern releases, etc.  Lots of Blue Note Tone Poets and Classics, Craft releases, and new releases from modern labels like Cellar Jazz.  They still have a great supply of good old vintage records, though, and that&#8217;s where the gold is.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I&#8217;ve been to Amoeba twice so far since I&#8217;ve been up here this summer, and both were pretty productive visits.  The first visit resulted in my finding a phenomenal record that I didn&#8217;t even know existed:  A tasty album by Bay Area-guitarist Eddie Duran.  It was recorded in the 1970&#8217;s and features Duran in a trio setting consisting of his guitar, bass, and drums.  It&#8217;s title, <em>Ginza</em>, is what caught my eye.  I&#8217;ll have to write about that record, because it&#8217;s delicious.  But speaking of Eddie Duran and &#8220;Ginza&#8221;&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Records</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:700">Little Band Big Jazz // Conte Candoli (Crown)</h3>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Vince Guaraldi has been experiencing a revival of sorts these past few years.  Thanks to Craft Records&#8217; renewed interest in the pianist&#8217;s catalog, his legacy and appreciation is receiving a major boost.  It&#8217;s well-deserved, and as a long-time Guaraldi fan, I love to see it.  Some of his best work however was as a sideman, and in 1960 he made a record with Conte Candoli and Buddy Collette that&#8217;s absolutely perfect in every way.  <em>Little Band Big Jazz</em> is the album, and it&#8217;s really obscure.  Like really.  I&#8217;d always kept an eye out for it but was beginning to think I would just have to buy it online instead of finding it organically.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><a href="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6690" data-permalink="https://raggywaltz.com/img_1630/" data-orig-file="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg" data-orig-size="2956,3141" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_1630" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg?w=282" data-large-file="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg?w=820" src="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg?w=820" alt="" class="wp-image-6690" style="width:280px;height:298px" width="280" height="298" srcset="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg?w=280 280w, https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg?w=560 560w, https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1630.jpg?w=141 141w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a></figure>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Then a couple of weeks ago, I decided to go back to Amoeba.  I&#8217;d seen the new Sonny Rollins <em>Go West</em> box set from Craft, and after a barrage of Instagram ads and then an Instagram post from DJ Pari, I decided to go back and grab it.  After picking it up, I thought I&#8217;d take a quick flip through the &#8216;new arrivals&#8217; section.  A few flips in and I saw this record.  I was stunned.  Speechless.  I had no speech.  The record cover was pristine (in shrink wrap), and since the cover is one of the coolest things about the record, I quickly grabbed it.  The record label that it&#8217;s on, Crown, isn&#8217;t the most high-quality of labels, and I&#8217;m curious to hear how the record sounds.  The recording itself was done rather well, as modern reissues reveal, but the quality of the original mastering and vinyl pressing is another story.  I have two other original Crown records from the 1950&#8217;s (Coleman Hawkins and Bud Shank) and they&#8217;re both pressed on what sounds like recycled vinyl (steady hiss throughout) and terribly mastered (very tinny and compressed).  I still bought it though.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In a neat set of circumstances, I had just gotten a Jazztet record a few days earlier.  That record had been recorded and released in the 1960&#8217;s and had my favorite Benny Golson composition on it:  &#8220;Along Came Betty&#8221;.  This record is cool in that it&#8217;s a reunion record of sorts.  Recorded in the 1980&#8217;s live at a New York City club, Art Farmer, Benny Golson, and Curtis Fuller are all back on the frontline playing Golson&#8217;s tunes but with updated arrangements.  &#8220;Along Came Betty&#8221; is on here, as is &#8220;Whisper Not&#8221; and other groovy Golson tunes, with everyone stretching out and having a great time.  An easy pickup.  Actually, no, not that easy.  I was originally hesitant since it&#8217;s from the 1980&#8217;s, which was a suspect time for jazz.  But the lineup and the song choices all pointed towards a solid album with solid music.  Listening to it online confirmed it.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I&#8217;m not as hip as many of you seem to think I am.  I was initially drawn to the cover and the record label of this album.  It wasn&#8217;t until I read the liner notes that I remembered that Don Rendell was one of those British jazz musicians that are considered cool and collectible.  I&#8217;ve seen his name and albums mentioned on Instagram, so it was neat to find his album in the flesh and by accident.  I&#8217;ve been told that this album really is &#8216;roarin&#8217; and burnin&#8217;, so I&#8217;ve been holding off on listening to it online so I can experience it on vinyl when I get home.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For a while, Giuffre (pronounced &#8220;Jew-free&#8221;) was a pretty straight-ahead jazz player with a distinctive sound on clarinet and tenor sax.  Then in the 1950&#8217;s, he started moving increasingly towards the more esoteric forms of modern jazz, swinging less and less.  This album catches him in that transformation.  I grabbed it thinking it was Giuffre the swinger, since I like modern jazz as heard on a clarinet and I dig Giuffre&#8217;s clarinet like the most.  The supporting cast of characters also made me pick it up.  Then I got back to the crib and actually read the liner notes.  It&#8217;s esoteric jazz.  Whoopee.  It could still be stimulating music though, so we&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I don&#8217;t care.  I dig George Shearing.  The Bible says there&#8217;s a time and place for everything, and that goes for jazz.  More than one dinner party or get-together at Casa de Tarik has used a Shearing album as a merry soundtrack, and I&#8217;ve even thrown a Shearing album on when nobody was around for my own enjoyment.  &#8220;Mambo Inn&#8221; is a particularly good track, but &#8220;Jumping Symphony Sid&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ll Remember April&#8221; among others are fun, too.  I already have this album, but the vinyl looked pretty clean, so this could either be an upgrade or a Christmas gift for one of my friends.  Bwahahaha</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Like I said earlier, this release has been on my radar since before it even was released.  Sonny Rollins&#8217; <em>Way Out West</em> album is a classic, but I&#8217;ve never owned it and never listened to it, so I was intrigued about obtaining it as a fancy reissue.  I&#8217;m looking forward to sitting down and consuming this set.  It&#8217;s a handsome package, from the box itself to the album jackets, which are nice and thick.  As for the music, there&#8217;s the original <em>Way Out West </em>album, plus another record Rollins made with some Contemporary Records artists like Hampton Hawes, Shelly Manne, and Barney Kessel, and then an album of alternate takes and outtakes.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">All in all, a solid trip.  Do I need to go back to Amoeba? Nah, not really.  There&#8217;s other, more local stores that I&#8217;ve been going to, and local stores are the best stores.  There&#8217;s a few that have been a part of the Bay Area scene for years, but there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s been on the scene barely longer than I&#8217;ve been up here.  More on those places next time!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Well jello again.  It&#8217;s ME.  Jack Benny.  I know, I know.  &#8220;Where have you been?!&#8221;  &#8220;I thought this site was dead!&#8221;  &#8220;I thought YOU were dead!&#8221; Etc., etc., etc.  And those are all fair and valid questions.  It&#8217;s been a year since I&#8217;ve last shown life on here.  What a year it&#8217;s been, too.  But you, dear reader, are not here to read about my personal life; you are here for jazz, vinyl, jazz on vinyl.  About that&#8230;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />



<span id="more-6654"></span>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Over the years, I&#8217;ve sporadically wondered about the &#8216;bigger picture&#8217; when it come to record collecting.  I&#8217;ve written about the internal conflict I had/have concerning my personal taste regarding jazz and how said taste influences what I seek out on vinyl.  Recently, due to a series of life changes, I have once again thought about record collecting and its place in my life.  This reflection is not due to some poetic revelation.  No, my thoughts were inspired by something more practical and straight-forward.  Talking to my record-collecting friends that are married, they all mention how, at some point, their wives begin looking at their record collections and each new acquisition with growing bemusement.  This inevitably forces a reevaluation of their collecting habits.  Hard questions are asked, then answered.  As someone who hopes to be married, I decided to get a jump-start on figuring out what the point of my record collecting is.  After all, space is finite.  I can&#8217;t just continue grabbing vinyl for ever.  I&#8217;m cooking up a post on my thoughts and answers on that topic, so stay tuned!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">My vinyl-induced existential crisis hasn&#8217;t kept me from stimulating the national vinyl economy, though.  Not at all.  In fact, this here year 2023 has been the greatest year in my record-collecting life.  Why?  I have purchased far more records in these eight months of 2023 than I ever have.  I&#8217;m both proud of that (this is why I went to college!  Well, that and to become a productive member of society.  But mostly to fund my hobbies) and ashamed of that (so much money&#8230;), but it&#8217;s the truth anyhow.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For the past two months I&#8217;ve been based in the Bay Area of California, and in my spare time I&#8217;ve visited the local record shops.  In the process, I&#8217;ve found a lot of phenomenal things.  Records, yes, but also amazing people.  Since I don&#8217;t have a record player with me, I thought I&#8217;d highlight some of record stores I&#8217;ve been to and some of the things I found at those stores.  Kinda like those old posts I used to do way back in the day.  The first post will (hopefully) drop tomorrow, so check back for that.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Oh, and I WILL eventually respond to those emails!  I feel so honored that so many of you have reached out in spite of my inactivity, and do my best to get back to you all soon.  Life has been pretty wild for those working in healthcare, but I want to get back to writing about jazz and records regularly.  It was exactly a year ago today that I made my last post.  Here&#8217;s to writing more!  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">And yes, that is me furiously typing away on a typewriter.  An Olivetti Studio 44 to be specific.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Do you remember what it was?  Do you remember the tune, the song, the album, the artist that started you on the path to becoming a jazz fan?  What was it about that particular item that made it all make sense?  In this post, the first in a series of posts dedicated to the songs and albums that provided the soundtrack to my childhood, I revisit the song that was my gateway drug into the wonderful world of jazz.  Not to be cheesy or predictable, but, the tune truly was &#8211; and is &#8211; somethin&#8217; else.  With that, to the music!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Music</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/autumn-leaves-miles-and-cannonball.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Tune:  &#8220;Autumn Leaves&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Recorded:  March 9, 1958 in Hackensack, New Jersey</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Personnel:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Cannonball Adderley &#8211; Alto Sax</li><li>Miles Davis &#8211; Trumpet</li><li>Hank Jones &#8211; Piano</li><li>Sam Jones &#8211; Bass</li><li>Art Blakey &#8211; Drums</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Up until 4th grade, I had no true musical predilections.  I simply liked whatever was playing on Radio Disney, an AM radio station that played the teeny bopper hits of the day as well as a healthy mix of random classics (like Ray Charles).  Then, one day, my dad burned me a CD with a variety of songs across multiple genres, an attempt by him to &#8220;broaden my horizons&#8221;.  That resulting CD certainly covered in incredible amount of ground.  Disco, rock, rap, reggae, funk&#8230; and jazz.  Nestled amongst tunes from Gary&#8217;s Gang, Brass Construction, and the Human League was a beguiling piece of music with no words at all:  &#8220;Autumn Leaves&#8221;.</p>

</div>


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This album in general is a true gem.  Even if it hadn&#8217;t been recorded for Blue Note, this record would be something special.  Made as a unique one-off project for Blue Note, this album finds alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley as the leader (technically) of an all-star band that included, among other notable musicians, Miles Davis (the unspoken leader).  Adderley was in Miles&#8217; employ at the time and, after making an initial splash on the New York scene in the mid-50&#8217;s, was at the cusp of truly coming into his own as an artist.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Miles, of course, was Miles.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The tasty piano of Hank Jones adds more than a touch of sophistication to the proceedings, and Art Blakey, known for his bombastic drumming, lends restrained yet firm percussion support.  Sam Jones (a future bandmate of Adderley) provides his sturdy bass to round out the group.  The music they create is spectacular.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Despite being billed as Cannonball&#8217;s album, Miles&#8217; fingerprints are all over the record, beginning with the first track.  &#8220;Autumn Leaves&#8221; would become a staple in Miles&#8217; band, and it all began here.  This particular arrangement of the tune was inspired by Ahmad Jamal&#8217;s version of the song.  Miles simplified the bass line, slowed the tempo down, and decluttered the rhythm, creating an entirely different vibe from Jamal&#8217;s arrangement.  The result is a haunting, floating intro that slinks rather than grooves.  The mood is briefly shattered by stark statements from the horns before it quiets down again.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The track unfolds in a mystifyingly beautiful manner, each soloist adding their own voice and character to the music yet maintaining the reverential air.  Cannonball with his soulful, joyful alto attempts to inject the almost melancholy atmosphere with ebullience, but instead creates darkly romantic music.  Miles picks it up with his sparse, muted horn, the essence of less-is-more.  The rhythm section&#8217;s accompaniment is superb; Blakey&#8217;s use of brushes coupled with the two Jones&#8217; tasty work in turn elevates Miles&#8217; own solo statements.  All in all, this track, the longest on the album, is incredible.  Little wonder that it was able to cause me to stare transfixed at the speakers of my stereo system.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Considering the near-spiritual experience I had with the song, it wasn&#8217;t until many years later that I heard the rest of the album.  &#8220;Love For Sale&#8221; came on the radio while I was working at Cold Stone in high school, and that was the catalyst to finally check out the rest of the record.  I&#8217;m glad I did, because after &#8220;Autumn Leaves&#8221;, some of the album&#8217;s best moments happen on the flip-side.  &#8220;One For Daddy-O&#8221; has one of the struttingest, catchiest melodies that a blues has ever produced, while the album&#8217;s title tune &#8220;Somethin&#8217; Else&#8221; has some fun call and response moments from Miles and Cannonball.  This album marked Cannonball&#8217;s first and only appearance on Blue Note Records, as well as Miles&#8217; last appearance on the label and one of his last projects as a sideman.  As it stands, this album is, like I said at the top, a gem, pure and simple.  Not only is it a gem in Blue Note&#8217;s discography, or even in the pantheons of jazz history, but a gem in my life.  I may have heard jazz before, but this was the gateway drug into jazz&#8217;s artistry.  What was yours?</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Raggy Waltz Rating: B</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Considering how phenomenal photographs of Miles in the studio exist, and considering how talented a photographer Francis Wolff was, it&#8217;s almost criminal that this was the cover art that Blue Note decided to go with.  Not that this is a terrible cover.  On the contrary, it&#8217;s quite effective marketing, starkly stating the pertinent information in varying colors and sizes against a jet-black background.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At least we&#8217;re treated to one shot of the guys in the studio, courtesy of Francis Wolff.  The liner notes are by Leonard Feather, the notes themselves are full of interesting tidbits and insights (like the bit about Miles modifying Ahmad Jamal&#8217;s arrangement).  Unfortunately, the liners are also spoiled by a stain of some sort.  Considering how old these records are and what they&#8217;ve seen during their 60-plus years of life, it&#8217;s probably more incredible that more records don&#8217;t have this kind of thing on them.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again &#8211; Blue Note has some delicious labels.  Blue and white.  That&#8217;s all they used, and yet.  Mercy.  The deep groove on both sides and the address point to this being a first pressing, which is neat.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The sound is snappy and crisp as well, as Rudy Van Gelder&#8217;s recordings should be.  My copy is in glorious mono and full of body and presence&#8230;and groove wear.  The groove wear isn&#8217;t too bad on this track, but it&#8217;s there and gets worse on the rest of the record.  Normally, I&#8217;d be disappointed, but I can&#8217;t blame the previous owner.  This is a great record, worthy of repeated playing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Place of Acquisition</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Back in the B.C. years (Before Covid), a record collecting friend of mine from Instagram came upon a huge vinyl jazz collection.  He slowly sold items from the collection, and when I learned this record was among the many titles in the collection, I leapt for it.  At the time, it was the most expensive record I had yet bought, surpassing $200.  As an original Blue Note album in the coveted 1500 series, the price made sense.  As the record that started me on my jazz journey, the price was inconsequential.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Coming up next, I revisit another jazz album from my childhood that received heavy rotation on my CD player.  Warning:  it&#8217;s probably not what you&#8217;re thinking.  Any guesses? </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this month, I had the privilege of writing an article for a religious periodical named <em>Spectrum Magazine</em>.  Before you bemoan the lack of separation between church and site, dig this:  My article was about jazz and the politics of who and what makes music sanctified.  <a href="https://spectrummagazine.org/arts-essays/2022/swing-lo-dont-swing-too-hard">You can check it out here</a>.  Besides the subject matter, the article is particularly noteworthy because it&#8217;s my first paid writing job (you didn&#8217;t think I made money off of this humble blog, did you?  I do this for free, gratis, nada.  Not that I&#8217;m complaining).  In addition to that (and arguably more importantly), my article made my mother a Bill Evans fan &#8211; a development I did not foresee.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As for the &#8220;things to come&#8221; part&#8230;  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Recently, I had one of those experiences with record collecting that happens all too rarely. It was the type of experience that drives home the point of why I started seeking music out on unwieldy LPs, why I STILL seek out music on vinyl, and why it all matters to me.  </p>

</div>


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I&#8217;ve met a lot of great people through the Instagram jazz collecting community over the years, including a special cadre of collectors that have become actual friends.  Because of one of those special friends, I was recently able to add a cherished Lee Morgan album to my personal library.  Cherished, because I had a personal connection to the music on the record, a connection that stemmed from my childhood.  Listening to it, I thought about all the records I owned that I had sought out specifically because of that very connection.  One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I had concocted yet another series of record posts.  Because, as regular readers now, we here at Raggy Waltz Inc. love a good series.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The series will explore records that I have that have been a part of my life&#8217;s soundtrack for decades.  Consider this an ode to my record collection, or a musical journey through my childhood.  Don&#8217;t worry, though.  It won&#8217;t be nearly as sentimental as that previous sentence.   Reissues, original pressings, original reissues are all getting written about.  And despite what the record labels may or may not be, this is NOT a humble-brag  type of thing.  It&#8217;s purely about the music!  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The series will also give me an excuse to comb through my records and fresh things to write about.  Not that I haven&#8217;t anything to write about.  To the contrary, I&#8217;ve been suffering from sensory overload.  There are records that I bought years ago that I&#8217;ve been wanting to blog about, but they get put in a never-ending queue.  Here&#8217;s to clearing the log jam as well as sharing some familiar and not-so-familiar records with you all!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Lastly, for those who know/care/read, I&#8217;m working away on my Walter Mitty-esque dream to write a book.  A Brubeck Quartet book, that is.  I&#8217;ve started a very rough draft of chapter three of my secret book.  No publisher yet (it&#8217;s a secret, ya see), nor have I started that process yet, but it has been a fun experience nerding out to the Dave Brubeck Quartet and writing about it.  Who know?  When you walk into your favorite bookstore in 5-10 years, you may see a Brubeck book peeking at you from the shelf with a name that looks stunningly similar to mine.  But you didn&#8217;t hear that from me.  Or read it.  Happy Monday, and thanks as always for stopping by Raggy Waltz!</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-paragraph">Back in March of 2021, I had the incredible opportunity to talk with George Wein, jazz impresario and creator of the Newport Jazz Festival.  I specifically talked to him about Dave Brubeck and his quartet, a subject he was more than happy to discuss.  This is the last half of that interview.  If you missed the first half, you can check it out <a href="https://raggywaltz.com/2022/05/18/the-george-wein-interview-part-1/">here</a>.  Mr. Wein and I talked over the phone on March 9, 2021.  To the mus&#8230; my bad.  To the words! </p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />



<span id="more-6612"></span>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Me:  You started a Newport that went to Europe, you went to French Lick, etc. It seems as if on all those diff concert tours, you always had Brubeck there.  What was the reason you brought Brubeck along to all of those different places?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Wein:  He sold tickets and I was the promoter. But I also just enjoyed working with Dave. It was a pleasure working with him. He made your life easier. You didn’t worry about him causing you problems. He had respect for other musicians, and believe it or not all the other musicians -I never heard another musician, whether Miles or Blakey, or who ever you want to think of, at that level that didn’t show respect to Dave Brubeck. That’s something that people don’t realize, and now even Wynton Marsallis has spent a lot time with Brubeck’s music. He became a fan of Brubeck’s.  That was late-coming. Dave Brubeck is a classical figure, a classic figure, and we’re very grateful to have known him and have worked with him.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Regarding other artist’s opinions/respect, Miles and him publicly had a tumultuous relationship but privately were friends.  Is that true? Any stories about him and other artists.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When names came up, I never heard Miles say a negative thing about Brubeck, and he would say a lot negative things about a lot of people.  At festivals, when Dave and Miles were on, Dave would always go over and say hello to Miles.  He wouldn’t wait for Miles to say hello to him, he would go over to Miles.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>What about Paul?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Paul was a lot more involved with the general music scene. Paul hung out &#8211; if the musicians were hanging out at Jim and Andy’s and he was in NY, Paul would be at Jim and Andy’s with Jim Hall, people like that.  He loved Jim Hall.  But Dave didn’t hang out like that. Dave went home with Iola and the kids.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>About the sidemen. Any stories?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Eugene Wright and Joe Morello were on the tour of NY so I got to know them pretty well.  Joe was a good guy, Eugene was a wonderful human being.  We used to kid [Joe]. Joe he was blind, he had a problem seeing, he needed help. He wasn’t totally blind but he needed help. They just fit. The rest of [the sidemen] were in and out. But once he got Morello and Eugene Wright he stayed with them. When Morello&#8230; believe it or not, I recommended a drummer for [Dave], Alan Dawson. I recommended him. He was a Boston drummer and I knew Alan for years. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Talk about bringing the Newport Jazz Festival (NJF) concept to the world?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Well, the NJF was known all over the world because of the Voice Of America (VOA). The VOA got to jazz fans everywhere, and when I got out word that I wanted to bring a festival package to Europe, there were promoters all over Europe that wanted to work with us.  We had varying degrees of success. We went to [Yugoslavia], Spain, to Paris, to Scandinavia, Amsterdam, Brussels, Vienna, and I’m still friendly with the promoters.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Was there a different audience reaction overseas to jazz or to Brubeck?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Not really, about the same. People always ask about that, maybe different in clubs, but in festivals about the same.  Pretty much similar. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>I&#8217;ve gotta ask.  Did you notice any racism directed at the group or Eugene Wright?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">No, I never noticed. I may not have noticed because it&#8217;s there all the time. Racism is endemic and I’m sure Gene ran into a lot of problems.  He was black, and as the expression goes, you’ve never been black in your life, so how will you know what it&#8217;s like to be black?  But our festivals broke down a lot of racial barriers.  A lot of places where we went like French Lick, Indiana, we broke down the&#8230; We integrated the swimming pool!  Dizzy Gillespie jumped into the swimming pool and he was the first black man to do that!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Has the Dave Brubeck Quartet left a legacy in the jazz world?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That’s an interesting question.  It’s easy to say that people remember the DBQ for “Take Five” and being able to play jazz in 5/4 and time signatures, and that’s a great legacy you know.  Of course, their legacy goes beyond that, but that’s what people remember.  To this day, people are going *hums melody to &#8220;Take Five&#8221;* and that pioneering in time structures has probably been the major part of his legacy.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Are they still relevant?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I think anybody playing good music is relevant.  I have total respect for their kids, because they had to overcome Dave Brubeck as a father!  People always look at them as “well they’re Dave’s kids”.  That’s a good group!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>They really are!  Thank you again Mr. Wein for talking to me.  I really and truly appreciate this.  Is there anything else you wanted to add?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Write a good book. That’s all I say. If you want to write a book, write a good book.  There haven’t been very many books on Dave Brubeck.  I’ll just close this with the last time I saw Dave. The last time I saw Dave was at his house. He died a few weeks later.  At Newport… at least ’12, he was supposed to play with his family and he called me to come over. He was in an automobile, and he said “George, I just can’t do it. I don’t feel up to my standards of what I feel should be my playing. Would you forgive me if I don’t play?”  And we sat there and talked for 20 minutes about anything. I forget what we talked about. I’m sure we talked about our skunk. We always laughed about that skunk. But it was very moving, we sat in our car outside the walls of the festival and just the two of us, and Iola was in the back seat, and we just talked, and that was the end, and that was very moving.”</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>I would be remiss if I didn’t ask: What do you think was Dave’s defining characteristic was?</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I always said that Dave was a total gentleman.  And that defined the way everyone felt about him. He was a gentleman! He respected everyone. He commanded respect from you without asking for it. He just represented the best a person could be.  I have never known him to be negative! He was kind, he was generous, if things didn’t go well, he didn’t get upset. If things went well, he didn’t gloat. He just was a beautiful human being.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">How many posts have I started with &#8220;Here at Raggy Waltz HQ&#8230;&#8221;?  I don&#8217;t know, but add this one to the list.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Here at Raggy Waltz headquarters, West Coast Jazz reigns supreme.  I dig it and its creators.  Which is why yet another Barney Kessel album is being spotlighted.  This particular album has been on my turntable frequently ever since I brought it home, and after snapping my fingers to it the other day, I figured it was high time to share it with you.  So without further ado, let&#8217;s cook!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Music</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Tune:  &#8220;Just In Time&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Tune:  &#8220;Tiger Rag&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Recorded:  August 6, 1957 in Los Angeles, CA</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Personnel:  </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Barney Kessel &#8211; Guitar</li><li>Ben Webster &#8211; Tenor Sax</li><li>Frank Rosolino &#8211; Trombone</li><li>Jimmie Rowles &#8211; Piano</li><li>Leroy Vinnegar &#8211; Bass</li><li>Shelly Manne &#8211; Drums</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Cook is indeed the word of choice here.  In the case of the music here on this record, &#8216;cook&#8217; is both an adjective and a verb.  Things never boil over, explode, or pops off.  The music just cooks along, perfectly blending and stirring together under a constant fire.  </p>

</div>


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Recorded in that great year of 1957, but not released until 1962, the music was made by two different group at two separate sessions a few month apart.  Shelly Manne and Leroy Vinnegar were the constants, along with Mr. Kessel, of course.  The other men used on the two dates were one-offs, but the music is all spiritually related to each other and it works.  Again, to use the cooking analogy, the music just simmers along.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The first side features Kessel and Feldman on the frontline, supported by none other than Hampton Hawes on piano.  Feldman&#8217;s vibes are in the same bag as Cal Tjader&#8217;s in that the two vibists preferred to coast on the rhythm section&#8217;s fire, building off of their fire as opposed to creating the heat themselves.  The result is a cool, calm, and collected approach to the vibes that flows and tinkles like a refreshing stream of water.  Feldman even uses grace notes a la Tjader, tasty and cool.  Hampton Hawes is a major aid to the music here both as soloist and as accompanist.  His logical lines are a joy to hear and his playing stays firmly in the pocket. </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Speaking of pocket&#8230;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Shelly Manne and Leroy Vinnegar could carve out and maintain a pocket better than any other rhythm section on the coast, and this album showcases this ability repeatedly.  Vinnegar&#8217;s full, solid sound carries the entire band, and Shelly&#8217;s drumming is unobtrusive but firm.  &#8220;Just In Time&#8221; is a perfect example of this group when everything is just working.  The arrangement, the solos, the cohesiveness&#8230; absolutely tasty.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Incidentally, the title tune, &#8220;Let&#8217;s Cook!&#8221;, is a rather unique blues.  Written by Kessel, it&#8217;s a standard 12-bar blues for two choruses, then it has an 8-bar bridge that makes things interesting.  It&#8217;s conducive for stimulating blowing, and at 11 minutes in length, that&#8217;s exactly what the guys do.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">And that&#8217;s just the first side.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As much as I like the first side, the second side is where things really start cooking.  With the appearance of two horns, the music becomes earthier, gutsier.  And what an eclectic group of guys this is!  The legendary Ben Webster, famous for his stint with Duke Ellington&#8217;s band in the 1930&#8217;s and &#8217;40&#8217;s, lends his talents to proceedings.  Sharing the front line with him is another veteran of the big band scene, trombonist Frank Rosolino.   Jimmie Rowles replaces Hampton Hawes.  With this new lineup that encompasses a wide area of the jazz scene, the eclectic group stretch out on two chestnuts that were old hat in 1957.  Revamping the outdated tunes, the group proves that good jazz is as good as its creators.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The tune I decided to highlight (and it was a hard decision) is the grandaddy of all jazz tunes:  &#8220;Tiger Rag&#8221;.  Written and recorded in 1917 (in fact, one of the first jazz tunes EVER recorded), I was personally intrigued when I saw it was included on an otherwise modern jazz album.  &#8220;A joke&#8221;, I said to myself.  &#8220;A tongue-in-cheek joke&#8221;.  Putting the needle down on the record, I soon discovered how wrong I was.  The intro alone told me I was in for a fun ride.  With its small reharmonizations and brief rubato passage with Rosolino&#8217;s almost mournful trombone, it sounds like a completely different song.  And that was before the Latin section.  That&#8217;s right- they freshened it up with a Latin-esque treatment.  Just as I was processing this, Vinnegar&#8217;s bass began to walk with a strut, and before I knew it, the song had transformed once again into a cooking modern jazz outing.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Webster is up to bat first, and his opening statements is about the smoothest thing you&#8217;ll hear all week.  Buoyed only by bass and drums, Webster gently caresses his solo out of his horn in his breathy style.  Beginning his second chorus, Kessel quietly strums under him, and Webster slowly turns up the heat.  By the time Rowles joins in on Webster&#8217;s third chorus, Webster is romping, palpably enjoying himself.  Closing his solo with a fun trill, he makes way for pianist Rowles.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Rowles is a quiet pianist who values space, and his solo dials down the heat a tad.  I admit, I&#8217;m not the biggest Rowles fan, as he always plays like he&#8217;s hesitant and doesn&#8217;t quite feel comfortable with the goings on.  It works here though.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Rosolino&#8217;s solo is classic Rosolino, which is to say that it&#8217;s upbeat and happy.  By now, my foot was tapping hard.  Rosolino&#8217;s closing lick is too cool, and Kessel, obviously digging it too, plays it back as he begins his own solo.  He sticks to tasty single lines, his guitar getting that slightly twangy sound that made his guitar so distinctive.  When the tune ended, I was surprised.  Bowled over, really.  I couldn&#8217;t believe how perfectly suited &#8220;Tiger Rag&#8221; was for casual, no-frills blowing.  Who knew?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The second tune by this lineup, &#8220;Jersey Bounce&#8221; is another old tune that the group revisits and spruces up in the process.  Unfurling more languidly than &#8220;Tiger Rag&#8221;, the tune flows stately along like the Mississippi River.  The melody as played by the guys is catchy as a rash, and Kessel&#8217;s thick chords during the bridge are hipper than Shakira.  I strongly suggest listening to &#8220;Jersey Bounce&#8221; when you have 10 minutes to spare, because before you know it, you&#8217;ll be bobbing your head and tapping your foot something fierce.  And then you&#8217;ll be humming it for the rest of the week.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Opening the liner notes, Leonard Feather perfectly sums up the record and the music on it with his first two sentences.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;In addition to providing a delightful subjective experience for the listener, this album contains the elements of a valuable jazz document for musicologists.  Its eclecticism provides a stimulating reminder that there is room in jazz for a variety of approaches, just as there is in classical music, literature, and painting.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Reviewing the album for <em>Down Beat </em>in 1962, Pete Welding gave it three stars, a &#8220;good&#8221; rating.  Here are a few quotable quotes from his review:</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;In any event, the music that resulted from these studio meetings is unpretentious, bright, buoyant, relaxed, and uncomplicated.  Kessel plays with his usual lithe, spongy grace, sprightly wit, and consummate ease.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Playing with his customary warmth and power, Webster&#8217;s soaring work brings both <em>Tiger </em>and <em>Jersey </em>to sudden life and prods trombonist Rosolino into some fine playing.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;These two pieces have more than a slight edge over the quintet numbers, which are extremely pleasant, airy essays at extended improvisation by Kessel, Feldman, and Hawes.  They don&#8217;t have anything near the drive and sinew of the lengthy numbers with Webster, however.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;There is an air of healthy, good-natured fun about all five of these pieces that is most refreshing.  There&#8217;s not a frantic second in the entire 38 minutes and 45 seconds that make up the collection.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Agreed.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Raggy Waltz Rating:  C+</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I don&#8217;t know what it is that&#8217;s keeping me from giving this a higher grade.  We&#8217;ll say this is a nursing school C+, which would be a B- for every other grading scale (that&#8217;s right folks.  Nursing school uses its own grading scale).  To be sure, I like the picture of Mr. Kessel and the effect that they put on it.  I also like the minimalist titling in the upper left corner.  It&#8217;s just that&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.  It almost looks like a generic-brand version of a Blue Note cover.  Not terrible, still gets the job done, but its still not the same thing as the original.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As I mentioned earlier, the liner notes were done by Leonard Feather, one of jazz literature&#8217;s big names.  As always, he provides insight, behind-the-scenes- info, and critical analysis.  His name is one of the few that I use as an indicator of the kind of music that&#8217;s on the record inside.  </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The labels are Contemporary&#8217;s classic yellows, complete with deep groove, which are a rather surprising inclusion being that this record was pressed in 1962.  The mono sound is delicious, as is anything recorded for Contemporary by engineer extraordinaire Roy DuNann.  My copy is a bit crackly here and there, but the fidelity itself is crisp.  In the words of the late great Abraham Lincoln, &#8221; there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a little snap and pop.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Place of Acquisition</h2>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Towards the end of last year, I began spending a lot of time in Long Beach, California.  A hip little place on the coast, I quickly located the record stores there that were worth visiting.  One of those stores is Third Eye Records, located on a particularly swinging street in a particularly swinging area of the city.  I&#8217;ve found a lot of gems in there over the past few months, including this record.  Their prices are good, if not a bit unusual.  This record was $11.99, which is more than fair, but $12 is a pretty specific price!  At any rate, Third Eye takes a significant chunk of my paycheck each time I visit them.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After talking about this interview for a few months, the Raggy Waltz staff has finally gotten around to transcribing and editing it, and now presents the first of two posts of my conversation with Mr. George Wein.  After the conversation was over, Mr. Wein told me that he enjoyed talking about Dave Brubeck, and to call him again whenever I had anymore questions.  I knew that I was incredibly lucky and privileged to have been able to speak with him, and told him as much.  Little did I know how lucky I truly was, as he would be gone six months later.</p>



<span id="more-6582"></span>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"> The late George Wein lived an incredible life.  Born in 1925, the man became a jazz fan early on, which, combined with his entrepreneurial spirit, would prove consequential.  From opening a jazz club to starting the Newport Jazz Festival to briefly operating a jazz record label, Mr. Wein loomed large in the field of jazz and American culture.  In the course of his legendary career, Wein worked with almost every notable figure in jazz.  One of those notable figures was Dave Brubeck.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The lives of Brubeck and Wein intersected for the first time in early 1952, when the relatively unknown Dave Brubeck Quartet was booked by George Wein to appear at Storyville, Wein&#8217;s Boston nightclub.  Their paths would cross numerous times after that, professionally and personally, for the next six decades until Brubeck passed away at the age of 91 in 2012.  </p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Mr. Wein passed away last year, September 13, 2021, at the age of 95.  Luckily, I had the opportunity to talk with him over the phone only months earlier on March 9, 2021.  Our conversation was centered on Dave Brubeck and his quartet and Wein&#8217;s relationship with Brubeck.  I found Wein to be a rather funny man, and at five years shy of 100, as sharp as ever.  Being that he died six months later, this is possibly the last interview he ever did.  I&#8217;ve only lightly edited this interview.  And with that, let&#8217;s jump into the first part of my conversation with the late great George Wein.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Me:&nbsp; Well how are you, first of all?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">GW:&nbsp; <strong>I guess I’m ok, I’m not sure. Getting old every day</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Me: I have to say it&#8217;s an honor and a pleasure to be talking to you. You are a hero of mine, and you figure large in the history of jazz, so it&#8217;s a pleasure to be talking to you.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Well, its a pleasure to be talking to anybody for me, thank you. *Laughs*</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Well, lets dive right on into it.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You have worked extensively with the Brubeck Quartet from its very earliest of days back in 1952, and I want to ask you about that, when you first worked with them in ’52 at the club.&nbsp; You said that when they first got there, there weren’t many people but as they played, more people showed up.&nbsp; Why did you take a chance on this Brubeck group and if you were afraid that you might have made a mistake in booking them.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Well, we were a part of an artificial group of clubs in the country (Philly, NY, LA) and jazz clubs that were trying to pay attention to what was happening and the name Dave Brubeck and some said it was interesting music.&nbsp; That was my job, to present new things at my club, so there was a lot of talk about Dave and what he was doing and Paul Desmond, so I said “Give them a try”. I hadn’t even listened to their records that much because they didn’t have that many records in 1952.&nbsp; So they came in, and well the rest is history in that respect.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You didn’t listen to their records, so you didn’t know what they sounded like until they played at your club.&nbsp; You hadn’t listened to their albums before so when you heard them at your club, that was the first time that you were really hearing them?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Yeah that was the first time I really heard their music, was in the club. I hadn’t heard any recordings of them, I’d read about them, I’d read <em>Down Beat </em>about this group on the West Coast, so I said you know, that was part of what was happening at the time, the new groups: Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker. A lot of things happening, and we were just paying attention to everything.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>I had no notice if they were nervous or anything.&nbsp; I just know it took me four or five days before I realized one was Paul or one was Dave. I knew they were both there, I didn’t know who was who for four or five days.&nbsp; Both Dave and Paul were friendly, but Paul was more funky and Dave was more impersonal and friendly, and Paul you could talk about different things.&nbsp; The appeal of the group of course was that they were different!&nbsp; They looked different. The college kids related to them. They didn’t necessary look like college kids, but they looked like those that had just graduated from college.&nbsp; Nobody nobody played the piano like Dave Brubeck.&nbsp; I mean, he had his own style completely, different from Erroll Garner, different George Shearing, different from Oscar Peterson.&nbsp; Dave Brubeck had his own style, which a lot of the jazz critics didn’t particularly like but the people loved it because they could relate to the apparently difficult intricacies which were easy to absorb on an intellectual basis.&nbsp; So Dave Brubeck was an instant hit and having Paul Desmond with him.. Desmond was the only alto player in America at that time that played contemporary music but didn’t imitate Charlie Parker!&nbsp; All the great saxophone players, Phil Woods and everybody, they were Charlie Parkerites and Paul Desmond wasn’t. So here you had a group that was contemporary in music and at the same time had its own individuality and still related to the young people that came to see them.&nbsp; They could relate them on stage as friends, or as an uncle or as a cousin.&nbsp; They weren’t like Miles Davis who they could only relate to the greatness of his music.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I think it’s important that you say that Paul Desmond was an individual and not a Parkerite. You were talking about talking to Dave and Paul. What do you think their relationship was with each other and the other members of the group?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>The relationship of Paul and Dave?&nbsp; They loved each other.&nbsp; When Paul died, he left all his publishing of “Take Five” to Dave. He would not of done that if he loved Dave.&nbsp; At the same time, Paul really wasn’t that happy playing with Dave’s piano playing.&nbsp; He loved the whole association but he was happy when after a few years he could leave and play with more&#8230; not traditional players, but fitted his mental attitudes about music, which was was much more lyrical than Dave’s piano playing.&nbsp; Paul was pure lyrical in his playing while Dave was more &#8211; I won’t say swinging but more jumping and he jumped around from chorus to chorus.&nbsp; And yet, Dave when he played a solo in his Chopinesque type of thing it would be so lyrical that you could cry from it. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Since you’ve been associated with he group for years, almost all of their time as a quartet, and with Brubeck until he died, what was your professional relationship like with Dave, with Paul and if you even talked with the other members of the group?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>I knew so many musicians, and musician’s way of life, and yet I don’t think I know we had Paul Desmond to dinner when he had cancer, and we were friendlier with Paul. I don’t recall ever having Dave over for dinner. They did have me over for dinner, Dave and Iola. So it was a slightly different relationship.&nbsp; There was a trust there that they trusted me. You mention in one of your questions that tour we did in New York State, small towns. It was more New York, New Jersey, Vermont, and it was a total failure but we never cried. We traveled out every night in a car. I drove Dave and Paul was in another car with Charlie Bourgeois. The three of them were in one car and Dave was with me.&nbsp; We talked a lot. We talked about music. He loved Louis Armstorng.&nbsp; He loved the traditions of the music. He loved Duke Ellington, and he always respected the traditions of the music.&nbsp; I remember the most memorable thing of the trip. We hit a skunk one night on the road, and I let out a scream “we hit it! We hit it!” Dave always laughed at that. Hit it while driving on one of those back roads in upper NY.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">What made the tour a failure?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Those clubs had never seen jazz. There may be 50 jazz fans in each town, 75 or 100. I forget what town in Vermont, we went to Trenton, NJ. I think we did ten or twelve days. We did a good date in Montreal, Cananda. We did ok up there.&nbsp; I don’t have the routing of the tour, but it brought us very close because we were together for two weeks but Unfortunately it didn’t make us close business wise. Neither of us made any money. Dave didn’t make any money and I didn’t make any money.&nbsp; Dave got paid, but he didn’t get paid a lot of money. Too bad. It was a good idea. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I don’t know if you’re familiar with Desmond’s article in Punch Magazine, but I wondered if that experience came out from that tour.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>I don’t remember, but I remember we did a date in Vermont and Mort Sahl came to the date because he was friendly with Paul, and Mort Sahl used to talk about in his act made a joke about what you did in Vermont on a Saturday night.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You started the NPJ in 1954.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Brubeck was at ’55.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Any funny moments with DbQ at the NPJ?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>He was always available as I needed him. Whatever place in the program we asked him to put on, he didn’t have star complex and yet he was selling as many tickets as anyone else that was on the festival.&nbsp; Dave, in particular in New England with all the college kids, had a tremendous audience. Now we had that everywhere, like in Europe.&nbsp; This was before rock n roll took over the colleges and Dave Brubeck was the biggest thing in colleges and a lot of those college kids that saw him at college came to the festival.&nbsp; Dave Brubeck was a very important festival attraction. &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In your book, you said that Max Roach said you played with Clifford Brown.&nbsp; There’s a recording of a jam session between Brubeck, Desmond, Max Roach, Chet Baker, Clifford Brown. Do you remember with Brubeck and all them?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>I remember playing with Max but I don’t remember playing with anyone else. If Brubeck was there I wouldn’t be on piano. I didn’t have that much <em>chutzpah</em>!&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Between 1951 and 1967, jazz went through a lot of changes and yet the Brubeck quartet really didn’t change its sound. What do you think is the reason the DBQ was so popular despite all the different changes going on in jazz?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Brubeck was an individualist. He was his own changes. He made his own changes and that was his life.&nbsp; IT was like asking Erroll Garner to play differently, and he never played differently up till the day he died. Or like asking Louis Armstrong to be different. Brubeck set his own style.&nbsp; That was his image. That’s who he was, and till the day he died that was the way he played.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Do you think the interplay between Bru and Des had anything to do with it?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Oh there’s no question of Paul being important to the success of the DBQ.&nbsp; But everyone thought when Paul would leave that Dave would be finished.&nbsp; Dave of course, was not finished. He went on for the next 40 years after Paul left him.&nbsp; I said “Paul was the frosting on the cake, but Dave was the cake”. That really sums up the Brubeck Quartet in one sentence.&nbsp; Paul was the frosting. Peple loved him. But the cake, the guts of what was happening, the personality the individuality was Dave Brubeck.&nbsp; When Paul left him, I think Brubeck played with him for a while but it was always Dave’s quartet.</strong></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Did you notice Paul being erratic, unreliable, diva?</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><strong>Well, Paul could drink a little bit. He and Gerry Mulligan got together in London and got so drunk we wondered if we could keep the tour going.&nbsp; But they’re a professional. But if everyone was like Paul Desmond we’d have a wonderful world. A wonderful wonderful man.&nbsp; A sense of honor. He liked women. Women took advantage of him.&nbsp; I don’t know if you heard some of the stories.&nbsp; He enjoyed life.&nbsp; It’s a shame cancer killed him.</strong></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today is 5/4, aka Brubeck Day!  While technically speaking, 5/4 Day should really be about Paul Desmond, since he was the one that wrote the 5/4 song that went to stardom, &#8220;Take Five&#8221; has become synonymous with the Dave Brubeck Quartet as a whole.  As a result, we here at Raggy Waltz HQ always like to celebrate the day by highlighting one of our favorite &#8220;Take Five&#8221; performances.  This year, we bring you two.  Both are post-Desmond performances, and both take the tune far beyond Desmond&#8217;s initial conception of his humble little composition.  To the music!</p>



<span id="more-6573"></span>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The first &#8220;Take Five&#8221; comes from vocalist Al Jarreau.  In 1977, Jarreau released an album entitled &#8216;Look To The Rainbow&#8217;, which became a hit largely due to the inclusion of his spirited outing on &#8220;Take Five&#8221;.  As good as that version was, this version, recorded by video cameras, is even more incredible.  The groove that the musicians establish is ferocious, and Jarreau&#8217;s vocal treatment outshines the album&#8217;s.  His delivery of the lyrics, written by Brubeck&#8217;s wife, Iola, are wry and suits the music perfectly.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe class="youtube-player" width="820" height="462" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhq7fSrXn0c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"></p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The last version is by good old Brubeck.  Recorded 10 years after the previous version by Jarreau, Brubeck&#8217;s version is a masterpiece.  By this point, Brubeck had likely played the tune thousands of times.  Every nook and cranny of the tune should have been exhausted by this time.  After all, there&#8217;s only one chord to improvise on once you get past the opening hook.  And yet, Brubeck slyly opens his solo before stumbling upon a door that he hadn&#8217;t yet gone through.  With an amused smile, he opens the door, playing a bluesy phrase that shouldn&#8217;t fit in the minor mode of the music, but it does.  Going further out on this limb, Brubeck toys with the major/minor keys, and before long, Brubeck is playing an impressionistic, cascading solo a la Debussy or Ravel.  Just as he reaches the climax, he falls back to the minor vamp and its then that we realize just how far out Brubeck traveled.  Again, it&#8217;s a masterpiece.  </p>

</div></figure>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However you celebrate 5/4 Day, make sure it includes some Brubeck and not a little of Desmond, too!</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Updated November 2021:</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Three days ago, November 25th, would&#8217;ve been the great late Paul Desmond&#8217;s 97th birthday.  A new post in honor of Mr. Desmond will show up here in the near future, but in the mean time, here&#8217;s an older post from three years ago featuring some rare photography taken by Paul Desmond himself.  Happy birthday Paul!</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Born on this day in 1924, today is Desmond&#8217;s 94th birthday.  For this year&#8217;s Desmond birthday post, I decided to focus on one of Desmond&#8217;s hobbies instead of music, which I did <a href="https://raggywaltz.com/2017/11/26/happy-birthday-paul-desmond/">last year</a>.  The hobby?  Photography.  In addition to being a first-rate jazz musician, erudite linguist and undercover comedian, Paul was a photographer.  In fact, he was a serious photographer who took pictures for most of his adult life.  Unfortunately, most of these photographs have disappeared, and there&#8217;s little evidence of Desmond&#8217;s prolific picture-taking.</p>



<span id="more-5201"></span>

" data-medium-file="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brubeck57-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brubeck57-1.jpg?w=450" src="https://raggywaltz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brubeck57-1.jpg" alt="brubeck57-1" class="wp-image-3995" /></a></figure></div>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In 1957,&nbsp;<em>Down Beat</em> magazine published some of Desmond&#8217;s photography in a four-page spread in it&#8217;s annual yearbook issue, along with a brief blurb about the pictures from Desmond himself.&nbsp; Taken in 1956, the pictures feature, among other people, the Brubeck Quartet from that time period, with Norman Bates, Joe Dodge and of course Brubeck himself all finding themselves on the opposite end of Paul&#8217;s lens.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as Doug Ramsey writes in his book on Paul Desmond entitled <em>Take Five</em>,&nbsp;<em>Down Beat&nbsp;</em>subsequently lost the pictures and doesn&#8217;t have a copy of the magazine issue, either.&nbsp; Fortunately, I tracked down a copy of the magazine online, and for Desmond&#8217;s birthday, have included the four-page spread from the &#8220;Music &#8217;57&#8221; yearbook issue of&nbsp;<em>Down Beat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Desmond&#8217;s captions are humorous, as is his succinct introduction to the spread.&nbsp; I particularly like the last few lines from his intro, where he wrote that &#8220;&#8230;when you&#8217;re finally free to take pictures, things have generally quieted down considerably.&nbsp; I have, for example, 28 pictures of Joe Dodge yawning.&#8221;</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s too bad that most of Desmond&#8217;s photographic output has been lost, but here&#8217;s to shining a light on a sliver of his work.&nbsp; Happy birthday, Paul!</p>
