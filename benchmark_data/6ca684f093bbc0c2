        <description><![CDATA[
          It'll be a while until I can be able to find any meaningful words to describe my 2025 Christmas.
          <p>I’ve been living away from my hometown since 1996, which is when I started deluding myself with a now pointless certainty: the idea that distance would help my innate inability to accept things that end, people who die, and everything around it.</p>

<p>I lost my beloved mother on the 25th, a thousand kilometres away from where I stood still during a devastating phone call. Standing there, listening to my dear dad screaming in desperation, while his spouse and companion of 61 years was leaving him — and us — in real time. I waited on the line, crying, while paramedics arrived, tried something, and eventually picked up the phone to let me know that “the lady has died peacefully on the couch, in her home”. I know he was trying to say something comforting, a futile attempt to bring a sort of “kind rationality” to something that was actually a torment burrowing its way through my body and mind.</p>

<p>One day, I might be able to talk about what happened, and what’s happening. Today is not that day. I just feel the absence like a scorching absurdity, as painful as it can be. The past is slipping away, with time showing its harsh relentless truth: how a life, as important as it can be for an entire family, is a fleeting glimpse. You can turn around, warm your bones in front of a fire in a cozy room, and suddenly it is no more.</p>

        <title>More About Noise</title>
        <author>hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk (Simone Silvestroni)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          My <a href='/noise/'>latest post</a> generated an unusual amount of email exchanges. The back-and-forth was fantastic, rich, and inspiring, pushing me to contemplate more ways in which noise affects me these days.
          <p>One letter, in particular, picked my curiosity. Wrote <a href="https://meanwhiling.com/">by Noa</a>, its overture was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m a fairly long term reader of your blog. I wanted to reach out because your recent post “noise” really resonated with me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing about being a “long term reader” kind of stunned me. I’m fairly convinced that the people who read my ramblings are the ones that I know already. My pen pals of sorts, people that I’m used to exchange emails with. I guess the independent small web still manages to surprise.</p>

<p>Is this what happens when you ditch the corporate ultra-capitalist web paraphernalia? When you drop the pretence, renounce to vanity numbers, data, online performance, self-brand, projected persona?</p>

<p>It also made me wonder: how many people have I been reading for years without ever making an attempt to get in touch privately?</p>

<p>Back to the letter. We got to talk about <em>the noise</em>, until I came up with an analogy that might explain how I perceive social media today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine you are in a lovely cafe, with a back garden and all. Very relaxing. Sipping some amazing beverage, having tasty pastries, while having a relaxing conversation with a close friend, or your spouse. Imagine that your conversation gets suddenly interrupted by someone you barely know, or maybe even a stranger out of the blue. They pick up a chair, join you at the table, immediately starting to throw unsolicited comments.<br /><br />
Then, as quickly as they have arrived, they leave. Someone else appears, repeating the pattern. At some point, you realise you’ve been there for an hour, half-replied to dozens of people who are not close friends of yours, and don’t really know you intimately. You notice how all this completely derailed your original private conversation.<br /><br />
You don’t even remember what happened, or where and how it started, ending up with a bunch of scattered thoughts by someone you might not see ever again. Maybe some nice idea here and there, but definitely not a deep conversation. You’re not really enriched, and you wasted time that you could have used differently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realised that Noa is indeed a stranger to me, and yet, I was having a much deeper conversation than I could have had on Mastodon, or any other part of whatever can be considered a <em>social network</em>. I’m not against meeting new people virtually — quite the contrary. I just had yet another proof.</p>

<p>Noa also wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Short-form social media encourages speed, but speed discourages depth. The trouble is that most social media websites that supported long form content have either disappeared, or buried that functionality behind layers of distraction and unneeded features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speed. I had not thought about it. I keep thinking about asynchronous communication, old tech from the Nineties, and never realised that one common factor was a lack of speed. Things were happening at a pace that felt human. Speed also discourages focus, which brings me to another observation.</p>

<h2 id="ipod">iPod</h2>

<p>An article from the culture section of a newspaper (luckily they offer an RSS feed for each section) made me want to look for the iPod ads of the early 2000s. Of course, I found a supercut containing them all.</p>

<p>Some twenty-five minutes later, one thing stood out. All the ads for any subsequent model of iPod clearly showed a prominent feature: people who were hyper focused on the music. They were <em>lost in it</em>. Dancing, jumping, moving around with their white-corded earphones.</p>

<p>Until the iPod Touch came around.</p>

<p>Then, it swiftly changed to people playing video games, messaging, looking at websites, watching TV shows, using the iPod for anything <em>except</em> for losing themselves in one focused activity. The era of constant distractions. The uninspiring black slab. They can add any colour they like, it’ll remain a metal-plastic-glass dead slab built for distraction.</p>

<p>Enjoy a gem from a bygone era:</p>

        <title>Noise</title>
        <author>hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk (Simone Silvestroni)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          December has arrived, quietly. It often rains, at times windy. I put almost everything on hold, and the resulting calm is something to cherish.
          <p>November has been silent, for the most part, with a lot of working from home due to health issues. Rewatching old TV shows at night, reading blog post and long articles, mostly the latter. Very little news, I’d say a couple of pills here and there, nothing more.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I naturally stopped my participation to Mastodon, or the concept that goes by the name of Fediverse. It was not premeditated, it just happened. I logged in twice in a month. Both times, I logged out and closed the tab in less than a minute. It feels hard to explain — it’s like anything resembling a continuous feed of microblogs has become physically intolerable. No finger pointing, it’s the way it’s presented, how it reaches me.</p>

<p>It feels like noise, <em>it is noise</em>. I can’t relate to it anymore. It’s not a proper conversation, there’s no breath, no space, everything in those feeds is ephemeral by nature. Too fast. It just disappears, like a collective onset of dementia. Impossible to actually search, impossible to track anything after a while, it’s all lost, there’s no tether.</p>

<p>The idea of taking something that was born out of unethical primordial capital-fascist soups, redesign it with different clothes, and sell it as the free idealistic alternative to facebook or twitter, seemed nice. Until it wasn’t. Until it dawned on me that the problem is not facebook or twitter, or capitalism. It’s how its inner system makes impossible to build a real conversation, missing the natural space it requires.</p>

<p>It’s the ephemerality of the urgency that killed my participation. Yet another stupid thing built on speed and vanity numbers. I know they can be disabled, but they’re there in the first place. The potential to allow “virality”. As Roger Waters sang in <em>Not Now John</em>, fuck all that.</p>

<p>Besides, to show how (un)surprisingly little the Fediverse differs from facebook or twitter, here’s a number: ever since I dropped out, three people have reached out via email. This is not a complaint, I’m happy to be able to have those conversations, but I believe it shows the deep similarities. The underlying mechanism of feed-based social networks brings to this. You’re either in their <em>zeitgeist</em>, or you don’t exist.</p>

<p>Enough with that.</p>

<p>Email is my jam, and that’s it. I don’t even care about Signal anymore, and if it were up to me, SMS would be well enough for the mundane things that I use Signal for. Anything other than email, phone calls, or meeting in person, is just annoying unfocused noise.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          A hazy feeling has caught on me lately.
          <p>It’s almost as if a season has changed, within myself. Only coincidentally in parallel with Autumn replacing Summer, it left me troubled and a bit on edge. Can’t be exactly sure, but it feels like it goes beyond a recent loss in the family, or the flu that’s been bothering me for a week now.</p>

<p>Over the last month or so, I haven’t been able to interact much online, except for a spike in email exchanges. Although, at this point, I tend to consider email as an <em>offline</em> activity.</p>

<p>Feeling repulsed by everything that I kind of accepted until a few weeks ago, the only source of active communication, besides email, has been meeting people in person, or phone calls. Been reading quite a lot, personal stuff mostly, but also my RSS feeds, or the Kobo.</p>

<p>Slowly and quietly working through the release of <em>Skinny Kid</em> (German version); still planning two new EP/albums for next year. I’m unable to follow anything else. Whenever I get a whiff of political news, I run away very quickly. Can’t open Mastodon without being seriously annoyed after ten seconds.</p>

<p>It’s like the aversion for social media was not entirely rooted in refusing US-based tech death cult capitalism — it was rather about a revulsion against the idea of following a stream of unending micro-logs. I can’t seem to find any appeal in it now.</p>

<p>Personal websites are good: longer thoughts, even cross-site debates, are fulfilling. Being bombarded by hundreds of disjointed often low-quality posts simply feels pointless, unnatural. The whole idea was stupid, thus, replicating the same scheme using a non-exploitative model is not the brilliant improvement I bought into.</p>

<p>I’d rather live in the 1990s for a while.</p>

        <title>Trip to Somewhere</title>
        <author>hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk (Simone Silvestroni)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          Twenty-one years ago, I received a phone call whilst sleeping. Someone close to me had passed away, two days after I last saw him in the hospital. I knew it would have been our last goodbye when I left the ward. Ignoring anyone else who could see me, I cried in the street of Milan.
          <p>After the phone call, I stayed with his father, accompanying him at every stage while trying to help as much as I could during the ordeal. The trauma of losing someone my age two years earlier, taught me the powerful violence of enduring such a pain. I saw how parents should not be forced to bury their children, and yet, it was the second time in two years for me to witness.</p>

<p>We went together to attend the grim requirements of bureaucracy, and was there with him when we collected the urn. Sitting in the back of a car for two-hundred miles, I kept the remains very close, protected by my coat, as if the warmth could bring some comfort.</p>

<p>That car brought us from Milan to our tiny hometown on the seaside. There, he would rest forever, while his father could finally retire. I watched him during that trip, barely saying a word, welling up throughout without ever letting himself go. I knew him very well, he would have needed to be alone. Pain was a private thing, and I understood.</p>

<p>He had made a few mistakes in his prime, spent the rest of his life trying to fix them, devoted to save the son that was in the urn next to me. Too late.</p>

<p>I watched him trudging through the hometown for a couple days. At the cemetery, he didn’t say a word, watching the urn as it was set to rest next to my grandparents, on a cold sunny day in February. I watched him, an utterly defeated man.</p>

<p>After spending his whole adult life in the big city, he indeed retired in our hometown. His old plan of sharing his autumn years together with his only son didn’t materialise. Too late.</p>

<p>Two decades, slowly drifting between memories, photographs, books to read, films to watch. We kept exchanging lots of emails during these years, opening up to each other. Including talking about the painful process of loss, how we grieve.</p>

<p>Since he was a technophobe, constantly afraid of losing data, he had a maniacal relathionship with his printer. My first blog, the one I had started in 2002 and subsequently erased from my computers and from the Wayback machine, it turned out he had it. Printed, in full.</p>

<p>We kept writing emails, until he couldn’t remember how to use a computer. A strange form of dementia caught up with him a couple years ago — I say ‘strange’ because he never forgot our names, who we were, our roles in the various stages of his life. In one of his last letters, he explained how he felt: like he was “already dead”.</p>

<p>A month ago, I received a call whilst sleeping. He passed away. My dear uncle, defeated by his one attempt at life, who tried his best no matter what.</p>

<p>I stayed a week there, helping my family with the grim requirements of bureaucracy. This time, my sister got to protect and keep his urn warm before setting him to rest.</p>

<p>I went through his things, sorted documents, papers, things to keep and things to destroy. Among a dozen big folders, mostly packed with bills, I noticed a red one. My name was on a label placed on the edge. Inside, our emails, printed.</p>

<p>Despite having all those letters in my computer, I spent many hours reading them. Printed on paper, they felt different, a proper labour of love.</p>

<p>Safe travels, uncle A.</p>

        <title>Call It Like It Is</title>
        <author>hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk (Simone Silvestroni)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          I read with interest recent posts by <a href='https://www.thisdaysportion.com/posts/say-what-you-mean-and-be-damned/'>Leon</a> and <a href='https://bix.blog/posts/2025-10-13-kicking-puppies-is-beside-the-point/'>Bix</a> about&nbsp;—&nbsp;in essence&nbsp;—&nbsp;how to deal with taking a stance, by calling things out with their names.
          <p>At the same time, I’ve exchanged very interesting private conversations about the very same topic, in particular with a friend, a former (and future, hopefully) music collaborator from Italy. It surprised me how all this happened simultaneously despite the people involved being completely unrelated to each other.</p>

<p>I won’t get into the nitty-gritty of Leon’s and Bix’s points of view, as they have done it extensively on their websites, while I’d love to touch on where my other line of conversation landed. We both called a spade a spade, didn’t mince words, and agreed on how we’re handling these tiring times: by taking a solid stance.</p>

<p>Our position is pretty clear: as we’re living through what I can only describe as pre-fascism (the totalitarian type), akin to the 1920s in Italy and the 1930s in Germany, we found common ground into calling out what’s going on in the most direct way.</p>

<p>Taking a stance involves decisions. Things like quitting online services, or stop giving money to bootlickers sycophants like Apple and others, using the word <em>fascist</em> towards anyone showing support to the current authoritarian techno-supported wave. Things like cutting off people as well, why not.</p>

<p>My grandfather lived through similar times, joined an antifascist party, took a stance debating his Mussolini-adoring father-in-law, and what did he get in return? <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/after-1989-full-story/">Sent to Sachsenhausen for four years</a>. So yes, I stand firm against anyone who supports fascism in all its modern incarnations, even indirectly.</p>

        <title>Getting Ready for the Winter. Part 2, Writing Music</title>
        <author>hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk (Simone Silvestroni)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          After resuming my bullet journal a couple weeks ago, I started planning my next creative music endeavours. This time, back to writing and producing my own messages.
          <p>What’s taking shape, out of my scribbled notes on paper, are two distinct concept albums. Probably shorter than the previous one. I’m seeing 6-song works for now. I have names of all the collaborators I want to work with, a rough flexible timeline, and the themes.</p>

<p>Although, once that was lined up in black and white, it occurred to me how a few ideas have been living in my head rent free for the last six months or so: producing and releasing singles, which is something I’ve never done and never thought about.</p>

<p>As a first approach to returning to my music, I’ll be working on 4 singles, to be released in the Winter, hopefully, to be followed by my second concept album, still known by its working title <strong>Less Than One</strong>, and a third thematic work after that. The latter is still untitled, but I know it will be in Italian.</p>

<h2 id="the-singles">The Singles</h2>

<p>The first two are re-editions of a couple songs from <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/after-1989/">After 1989</a>: <em>Skinny Kid</em> and <em>The Day Before</em>.</p>

<p><em>Skinny Kid</em> will be partly re-recorded and fully remixed, with both title and lyrics in German. It’s a pet project conceived with <a href="https://bearte.space/">Bea Henkel</a>, with whom I share part of the song’s inspiration — Bea’s grandmother, <a href="https://bearte.space/liddieslied/">Liddi Jenni Möller</a>, was murdered by the Nazi, at the age of 33.</p>

<p><em>The Day Before</em> is my favourite song from the album, but suffered from bad production choices I made back then, which I’ve always wanted to rectify. I’ll wipe and remake a few parts, keeping what I’ve always liked, and remixing to my taste.</p>

<p>The other two singles will be unreleased originals. The first one, <em>Rainy Days Ahead</em>, is co-written with long-time collaborator and friend Gerald Duchene. It’s about the weird unsettling fascination I hold towards a door I see every day when I go to work. Leading to offices and labs, now part of the department of Psychology of the University of Cambridge, it’s where Robert Oppenheimer studied in the 1920s. It became sadly known in recent years as the place where the core idea of what became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> came out.</p>

<p>Lastly, but this I’m not entirely sure about yet, a fourth single could come out of a discarded song from <em>After 1989</em>. Its working title was <em>Come To This Gate</em>, and featured a lovely guitar arpeggio with a counterpoint of mellow piano melody. In 2019 it didn’t make the cut, but I’ve always liked it.</p>

<h2 id="the-concept-albums">The Concept Albums</h2>

<p><em>Less Than One</em> is all about the mechanisms used by fascism to insinuate into people’s mind, and the insufferable way these things have a tendency to repeat across time. I come from a country that holds the sad record of having invented fascism, having also decided to send their grandchildren back to power by democratic means on its 100th anniversary three years ago.</p>

<p>The as-of-yet untitled second concept album, in Italian, will likely be mostly spoken-word alternated with proper sung choruses. It’s the culmination of a 35-years personal obsession with the story of Post-War Italy, with its problematic geopolitical crucial position in the “iron curtain”.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/mavericks_settings.webp" alt="Screenshot of Mac OS X Mavericks showing Desktop, Dock, and the System Preferences window" />
          Semi-random notes on my ongoing experience of living in the (tech) past.
          <p>After taking the plunge, Mavericks keeps on giving. I created a brand new <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/setup/">Set-up page</a> featuring a probably incomplete list of everything I’m using. I’ll be adding more info along the way, and probably more pictures.</p>

<h2 id="experience-notes">Experience Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mavericks’ Aqua GUI, with its elegant and refined animations, gives a feeling that everything is running exceptionally well together. Almost as if it was a well-thought and organic piece of software (imagine that!).</li>
  <li>I never have to take breaks because of eye fatigue.</li>
  <li>Never felt a need to enable accessibility features to increase contrast or similar. The reason is that the Aqua GUI is already designed to have the correct depth, texture and contrast. Probably because its lead designer was catering for real people.</li>
  <li>Mavericks is definitely faster, easier and more intuitive to use.</li>
  <li>The Settings app (System Preferences) is a proper computer control panel. I know where every single item, or sub-item, is, as opposed to the horribly clunky iOS-like vertical version Apple have imposed from macOS Ventura.</li>
  <li>Older software is more efficient and quicker, despite running on a computer that’s more than 12 years old. Basically, it’s bug-free compared to their recent versions. Bloat-free software is the best.</li>
  <li>The same tasks on this computer take considerably less time. One extreme case study: last time I had to reinstall my dev environment using homebrew on the ‘modern’ MacBook Pro required more than 3 hours. MacPorts in Mavericks took less than 5 minutes to set everything up and be up and running.</li>
  <li>Most old software that is now abandonware is either on-par or superior to later incarnations. See Logic Studio or Adobe, among others.</li>
  <li>The result is less stress, and more time that I can spend on the computer without needing constant breaks, or swearing.</li>
  <li>A note on the above point: stress is very important, I’ve been way more calm after I switched to Mavericks than I’ve been in years (while working on a tech device).</li>
  <li>I don’t miss dark mode at all, on the contrary. My hypothesis is that dark mode was made necessary by the ‘blinding’ nature of the newer flat OSes.</li>
</ul>

          I co-produced, mixed and mastered Rythur's debut album. He's a friend from the US, currently living in Colorado.
          <div class="iframe-bandcamp">
	<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 350px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2646258534/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=e99708/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="https://rythur.bandcamp.com/album/alien-pop">Alien Pop, by Rythur</a></iframe>
</div>

<h2 id="todays-the-day">Today’s the day</h2>

<p>I met <a href="https://rythur.bandcamp.com/">Rythur</a> online on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rythur">the fediverse</a> some time ago, where we quickly bonded. His awesomely quirky (to me) approach to songwriting has always been a source of keen curiosity.</p>

<p>When I heard the demos a defined thought formed: “this could become a great work with the right producer”. I’m not sure if I was the right-est, but it felt good. And while it <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/acceptance/">took me way too long</a>, to complete my work, the important thing is that today’s the day.</p>

<p>From the album liners, one of the best compliments I’ve ever received:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I needed a FRIEND who actually liked my music and could master it well.</p>

  <p>I could tell, from previous conversations with Simone, that he was exactly the right person for my sounds. I had heard Simone’s Minutes to Midnight project and was blown away by the substance and clarity of it all. I knew from this that he knew how to shape sounds around themes and messages. <cite>Rythur</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="production-notes">Production Notes</h2>

<p>Similarly to my <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/la-matiere-meme-du-temps/">last music production</a>, the workflow with Ryan was pretty different from my usual. I’m used to receive source files in either Logic or Pro Tools, or sometimes stereo multitracks. While ẓavajêr sent me Audacity self-contained projects, Ryan provided songs in Garage Band. My optimism about Garage Band was quickly stifled when I saw how Logic crashed on every song import. For whatever reason, a different version of Logic, installed on a test machine running another macOS, opened 3 tracks out of 6, keeping its crash routine on the other half. I’m talking about the most recent versions here.</p>

<p>I changed strategy. Installed Garage Band, edited a few things directly in there, and exported each track as a proper audio file, recreating Logic sessions from scratch and importing said tracks. At that stage, it was a matter of getting into the feeling of the ‘themes and messages’ that Ryan mentioned in his liners.</p>

<p>One thing that I noticed, production-wise, was my instinct towards a total respect for certain sounds. In the past, I would have engaged with the artist, proposing slight changes and alterations, new sound banks for this or that instrument. Nothing major, but enough to slightly alter the overall texture of certain sections. Of course, the artist would have to agree, and generally speaking they did, because my intent was always to improve the overall impact of the message.</p>

<p>Not this time. It struck me how, after an initial tentative drum replacement, the general feeling was lost. I went another way: kept the intricacies of the sound textures together, left all the original instruments intact, limited my interventions to refining and polishing. A lot of EQ, compression, riding the gain, curating the sound image, and finding the sweet spot between drums and bass.</p>

<p>In the end, I didn’t overdo things, I used the essential tools at my disposal, creating personal presets that I could reuse across songs for specific instruments, to keep the overall style consistent. Cohesion was my end goal.</p>

<h3 id="bass">Bass</h3>

<p>After a first run of mixes was delivered, I got to engage with Ryan’s comments, requests for changes and so on. One day something happened. During a session of fixes for <em>I Wanna Knw</em>, I felt this unique urge to pick up my bass and replace the existing track with something deeper. While I largely respected the original part, I’ve added some personal flare, a different texture, little movements that are impossible to reproduce with a keyboard and a sampler. I was mesmerised, with a result so good that it only required two takes.</p>

<p>There was something sensual in the song, this non-dialogue between two distant people, this relationship that’s alive and dead at the same time, with burning embers clearly there. It’s the doubt of the narrator, the duality of their messaging each other, that pushed me to add a real deep bass sound to the song. To me, it needed that, something that makes the legs tremble.</p>

<h3 id="daws">DAWs</h3>

<p>I used Logic to mix the whole album. Throughout the production, I kept having this nagging feeling that I was doing “too little”, that I wasn’t giving the project my whole professional self. In reality, the realisation came at the very end, I was only keeping the initial inner promise: leave the core of his music intact. Ryan’s style is so peculiar, personal, the brainchild of someone with a life very different from mine, and yet, so very close.</p>

<p>For my pre-master stage, I switched to Reaper, re-familiarised with it after a long stint away from the software. Finally, I ended up mastering in WaveLab. Even though initially I didn’t want to, I felt like its environment invited me not to be distracted by further potential tinkering with the mix. Ended up doing way more polishing in WaveLab than anticipated, probably because I let too much time pass between sessions.</p>

<p>I’m quite happy with the result. It was not a familiar process for me, but once again, it’s when I move away from my comfort zone that I find ways to explore new things, allowing interesting and fun ideas to bloom.</p>

        <title>Getting Ready for the Winter. Part 1, Switching Technology</title>
        <author>hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk (Simone Silvestroni)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          First of a short series of posts, where I introduce my switch to an operating system released in 2013, running in a computer built the same year. I can't possibly explain all the fine details of how it works, it'd require a book, but I'll try to dig out the best impressions.
          <p>As explained at <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/looking-for-a-niche/">the end of July</a>, I found myself at the bitter end of a long process of detaching from modern computing. Apple in particular. As a pure experiment, I installed and ran Mac OS X 10.9.5 (nicknamed ‘Mavericks’) on an old MacBook Air. I liked it a lot. Way more than I had initially anticipated.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-past">Back to the Past</h2>

<p>Fixated with wanting to prove the folly of craving the latest shiny thing, I thought a good attempt would be to record and produce a single song using tech considered obsolete by today’s standards. Instead, something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>As I was increasingly noticing the ease of use, how the UI agreed with me, how fun and smooth using Mavericks was, I progressively started to flirt with the idea of switching completely to it.</p>

<p>So I did it.</p>

<p>Went to eBay to purchase a near-mint 2013 MacBook Pro, with great specs and a brand new battery. Price was less than a cheap Android phone.</p>

<p>Taking the plunge was less scary than I thought. Riding the wave (Mavericks pun intended) was exciting, as well as challenging at times, bringing an inexplicable feeling of accomplishment once I reached the final realisation: I could seriously replace every single software with either an older release, or something that I had abandoned long ago. Or, in some cases, with the latest modern version (Firefox, Chromium, Reaper, among these), because there is people working to maintain software for older OSes, bless them.</p>

<h2 id="abandonware">Abandonware</h2>

<p>To effectively go live in a tech past, a key concept had to be tattooed in my brain. I wrote this in my above linked ‘niche’ post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What has the Mavericks experiment showed me? That I grew up in a world where designers cared about their work, and also about the people who would end up using such work. Also, it demonstrated, in a direct and somehow brutal way, how every single so-called improvement that came later was mostly redundant, likely a marketing gimmick forced to sell more crap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once realised how most modern software has been constantly and hastily updated not for the sake of progress, but rather to follow a cycle of planned obsolescence, everything started to fall into place.</p>

<p>I couldn’t believe until I tried. I made a list of every app from my modern computing setups, looked for their last version supported in Mavericks (often carrying a <em>de facto</em> status of “abandonware”), and installed it. The vast majority is unbelieavably better: more usable, fast, better performant, mostly bug-free.</p>

<p>What do these older versions have in common?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No bloat.</li>
  <li>No marketing lingo and no patronising: you won’t find “maybe later” as an alternative to “yes”.</li>
  <li>Awesomely intuitive user interface.</li>
  <li>A beautiful icon that doesn’t look like it was designed by a 5-year-old child.</li>
  <li>Apple wasn’t trying to force me into doing what they wanted me to do, which leads to the refreshing and long forgotten feeling of actually owning my computer, which ultimately leads to my last point:</li>
  <li>Exceptional user experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again and again, I’ve been struck by surprise for how better the older incarnations of my software roster are, to the point where using their up to date versions on modern Macs feels now utterly frustrating.</p>

<p>Random examples: Carbon Copy Cloner, iA Writer, Apple Mail (this one really left me speechless, I had stopped using Apple Mail years ago), Lossless Cut, everything from Adobe.</p>

<p>The concept of abandonware is an unending fascination: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware">seemingly grey area</a> where the legality of using it remains entirely unclear in practical terms (law says something different). Versions that are considered obsolete by the software company, unsupported, in many cases removed from their website.</p>

<p>Things like Adobe Creative Suite 3, 4 or 5, or Logic Pro 9 with its attached suite of ‘Pro Audio apps’, Apple Aperture, Final Cut Pro 7, Sketch 3, iWork ‘09. I have the whole lot, mostly because I had purchased them many years ago. Had I not owned them, they could have been found on either <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/">The Macintosh Garden</a> or <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/">The Macintosh Repository</a>.</p>

<p>Quick note about Adobe: I don’t give a flying flamingo that the company unilaterally decided to shut down their activation servers for old versions. Their obsolescence game is for them, I’m perfectly content with reinstalling the software and authorise it with “alternative” methods. I paid for that shit, so that shit is mine, Jack.</p>

<p>Then, one unexpected surprise: software companies let me download old versions from their servers, often not exposed to the public. Some of them really went above their remit to help me out. More about this later.</p>

<p>These old programs work flawlessly, by the way — with or without an internet connection.</p>

<h3 id="example-ia-writer">Example: iA Writer</h3>

<p>I’m cronically unable to use modern iA Writer. Have been experiencing bugs on top of bugs, crashes, tickets with their helpdesk to little avail. All because of the “Library” functionality. Eventually, I switched to other Markdown editors, without ever finding a satisfactory replacement.</p>

<p>The Library functionality reminded me of how much I dislike software with a tendency to store files in their own proprietary databases, hidden away in the system. I’m talking about iPhoto with its offsprings, and a few others. I can’t stand it. I need files to be left alone, in my specific personal folders. I want to be free to switch operating system if push comes to shove, so they need to be where I can intimately know and control the entire taxonomy. Full stop, no debates.</p>

<p>For exactly the same reason, I’ve long refused to use software forcing me to use their stupid cloud. Things like Apple Notes, among others.</p>

<details class="highlight">
<summary>On syncing files with smartphones</summary>
<p>To reiterate: I don't care about how "convenient" having files in perfect sync with a smartphone might be. I don't write or edit my stuff on a phone, don't even want to. When I'm out, the last thing I need is yet another way to "be productive", which is idiotic lingo to justify a sub-par culture promoting work overload and perennial tech distractions. I enjoy my free time, thank you very much. For the rare times when I need something important on my phone, I use <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> (even though the sync direction it's 99% phone to computer, more like a phone backup). How can people still blindly trust cloud networks owned by US-based corporations, in 2025, is beyond me.</p>
</details>

<p>iA Writer 1.5.2, released in 2014, is the Nirvana. It lacks the Library, which means I’m free to keep my files wherever I want, and use the program as a pure editor, as in “open the file with”, either from Finder or within the program itself. It also means that it doesn’t need to load databases of sorts, so it opens in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>Compatible with Mavericks, the application can open <code>.txt</code> files, obviously Markdown, and — drum roll — modern <code>.docx</code> documents for reasons that I have not yet investigated. It’s so good that I set it as default for all plain text formats, bypassing Text Edit. It lacks the dual panel for a preview, but with <code>CMD R</code>, I can summon it in a millisecond.</p>

<p>Finally, for the nerd corner, I like the Nitti font way more than their new IBM Plex Mono flavours.</p>

<h2 id="relationship-with-software-companies">Relationship with Software Companies</h2>

<p>Whenever I was unable to find an old compatible software version, I reached out to their makers. Except for <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, they were all in the audio field.</p>

<h3 id="alfred">Alfred</h3>

<p>I owned every version of Alfred except for v3. The lovely people at Running with Crayons Ltd (makers of Alfred) went above and beyond to help me out, offering an old legit licence for v3.</p>

<p>I thought that would be an exception: they’re a small company, based here in Cambridge, it won’t happen again…</p>

<h3 id="izotope">iZotope</h3>

<p>Next, there was <a href="https://www.izotope.com/">iZotope</a> — not a small company anymore — because of iDrum. iDrum was a drum machine that I’d purchased, as a boxed CD, in the early 2000s. My legit serial number was glued to the box, which I lost.</p>

<p>iZotope acquired <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOChEQDTApY">iDrum</a> from its creator Art Gillespie in 2006, but for whatever reason, the licence never showed up in my iZotope account. Of course, the fact that it ceased to work on modern OSes didn’t help with finding out the discrepancy. It was a bygone product that I’d forgotten about.</p>

<p>Until I remembered it. Sent a ticket to support, hoping I wouldn’t get laughed at. Their quick response stunned me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lars (iZotope)</p>

  <p>Hello,</p>

  <p>below is a link and a serial number for idrum please try those.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by a brand new legit serial number, and two links to download the last version of iDrum, one for Mac one for Windows. After I thanked them, I even received this follow-up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>enjoy and happy creating!</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br />
Lars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Galvanised by this unexpected success, I reached out to each and every software company producing audio plug-ins that I know and use, asking for older versions that were not available on their websites.</p>

<p>Spoiler: I <strong>got them all</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="voxengo">Voxengo</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.voxengo.com/">Voxengo</a>’s CEO replied to me directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi! Since old versions are being requested very rarely, we handle them on case-by-case basis. Here is SPAN Plus 1.5 which should be compatible with MacOS 10.9: [link to follow]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I’ve no idea if I would miss new functionalities by using these old versions: I tried to load sessions that had SPAN Plus in the mix, and none have given me issues or weird sounding oddities.</p>

<h3 id="mcdsp">McDSP</h3>

<p>McDSP designs and develops the renowned <a href="https://mcdsp.com/plugin-index/compressor-bank/">Compressor Bank</a>, which I purchased a few years ago. They use iLok, and my v6 version is not compatible with Mavericks. I tried installing v5, but of course it fails to authorise because that’s how iLok works.</p>

<p>I wrote to them explaining my experiment, and this is what I got back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello Simone,</p>

  <p>Thanks for reaching out about getting CompressorBank to work on your OSX Mavericks System.</p>

  <p>Since you are a owner of a perpetual v6 license, I have deposited you a perpetual Native v5 license for you to activate!</p>

  <p>You can activate your new license using the following instructions: [instructions here]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was amazing! They weren’t obliged at all, yet they were keen to help. I loved this.</p>

<h3 id="waves">Waves</h3>

<p>I left Waves for last, because a little voice inside my head insisted that they would have tried their best to avoid helping me out. I couldn’t have been more wrong. They were super helpful, sending very detailed instructions on how to install my compatible plug-ins and have them working on Mavericks.</p>

<p>It worked like a charm.</p>

<h3 id="others">Others</h3>

<p>Anyone else fell into either of these categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The software, even the newest release, is perfectly compatible with Mavericks (example: XLN Audio). I’m still happily surprised about this.</li>
  <li>Older versions were listed in plain sight on the dev’s website.</li>
  <li>Someone created a project to keep the latest versions running in older incompatible OSes, like <a href="https://github.com/i3roly/firefox-dynasty">Firefox Dinasty</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blueboxd/chromium-legacy">Chromium Legacy</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="apple">Apple</h3>

<p>I logged in to the App Store to see whether I could re-download old software purchased years ago… Yes, I could! That’s how I got ReadKit v2.4.6 (brilliant and beautiful RSS reader), Paste v1.1.3, and a few others.</p>

<p>I could have downloaded a compatible version of Pages, Numbers and Keynote from there as well, however, I leaned on the older ‘09 version of the suite, still called “iWork”. It looks, feels and behaves way better. The version of Pages shipped with it was the cheapest and closest thing to InDesign/Quark Xpress that ever existed. It also perfectly opens modern <code>.docx</code> files — but not recent versions of <code>.pages</code> files, which says a lot about Apple.</p>

<p>I will soon create a separate page on this site, with a list of all the software that I use in Mavericks.</p>

<h2 id="mavericks-forever">Mavericks Forever</h2>

<p>A week after I’d decided to go all-in, I got a hint off Mastodon about a website called <a href="https://mavericksforever.com/">Mavericks Forever</a>. Although I was already deep into the project, with many programs already collected and installed, the website by “wowfunhappy” gave me a couple of important hints. Without those, I would not have used Apple Mail, or used custom standalone web apps in a Firefox framework, such as Google Maps, Bitwarden, Syncthing. Since he gave away a template to create custom ones, I now have Disroot webmail and XMPP chat in my Dock.</p>

<p>I even exchanged a couple emails with wowfunhappy. Lovely chap.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions-subjective-opinions">Conclusions: Subjective Opinions</h2>

<p>I’ve been periodically using increased contrast modes in modern macOS because I often feel fatigued by flat design, with its lack of depth and texture, and too bright (or too dark) interface. Increased contrast is ugly, hence the “periodically”. Found this quote about the UI of pre-Yosemite Mac OS X versions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The increase contrast option in modern macOS increases the contrast at the expense of making everything ugly. Aqua in OS X 10.9 and below are naturally designed with high contrast and tonal range in mind.</p>

<p>And <strong>boom</strong>, as someone used to say during live in-person keynotes. That’s it, in a nutshell. Using Mavericks for two months now, I’ve never felt the need to alter its GUI. Not once. Dark mode? Who cares. Transparency? When used with style, and plenty of usability testing before a release, it doesn’t hurt. It looks good.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the question of the lead designer. I believe Apple should have made Scott Forstall CEO instead of Timothy Donald Cook (that’s his full name, btw). Instead, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ex-employee-why-firing-scott-forstall-was-a-mistake-2012-11">they fired him</a> after Jobs passed away, putting Jonathan Ive at the helm. Later, someone else <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html">became lead designer</a> after Ive left to join the AI craze.</p>

<p>The result? Apple ended up with trillions in the bank, and zero vision, selling unrepairable metal and glass slabs. A bland uninspiring luxury brand mostly aimed at rich privileged people, who I assume care very little for the environment, happy to live in an ad-hoc designed digital jail. Those, I don’t understand.</p>

<p>The “rest of us”, the probably still privileged but not-so-rich ones who still use old Apple products, are the people who keep using their hard-won devices, maintaining them because they’re fully aware of the value of money, because they see clearly when someone forces planned obsolescence down their throat. These, I understand.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          
          <p>Enough with <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/tinnitus/">the whining</a>. Silvia and I have decided to kickstart the process that will ultimately lead us to share a dual citizenship. We came back to the UK two years ago, after failing to find common ground with our home country, and settled in our former house once again. Not coincidentally, we managed to find a way to pivot away from our old jobs.</p>

<p>None of the above was an easy feat, according to Westerner standards. It took time, and a great deal of effort.</p>

<p>Now, it would be possible (and easy) to speak at length about the problems of our adopted country. I would say that, at this age, my main interest is to focus on what I feel a keenship with, rather than the opposite.</p>

<p>We played that ill-fated game already, after the Brexit vote, for four years. It wiped us out. Then, Covid broke us, in every possible way, while we were exploring the possibility of migrating to Scandinavia between 2019 and the beginning of 2020. So, experiencing positive feelings about the place we’re living in is way more uplifting and motivating right now.</p>

<p>Also, what could people say to convince me not to get naturalised as a British citizen? Impending fascism? Sorry mate, our home country has already gone there three years ago — after having invented and tragically put to practice the goddamn concept 103 years ago.</p>

<p>There might be a “perfect” place somewhere else, for everyone. This might not be it, but we played our cards, and by accepting the hand we were dealt, we also take responsibility. For example, once we’re officially citizens, there’ll be two more votes that won’t go to fascists.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          
          <p>Once again, I find myself kind of forced to stop reading the news, in any form or shape. Filtering shit from the interesting bits is like trying to put a barrier to a fastidious tinnitus (which I have, by the way).</p>

<p>After a long time applying a harsh set of filters on Mastodon, where anything caught in my extensive amount of ‘cancelled’ keywords would simply disappear, I tried showing the ‘filtered’ notification for a while. It only led to the trap of clicking, seeing things that I didn’t want to see.</p>

<p>So, back to erasing anything from this increasingly repulsive timeline I’m living in. Apparently, some guy that I’ve never heard of was murdered in another country, and for reasons that look a tad forced to me it’s been debated for days on end, even here. I’m seeing major newspapers, including the ones presenting themselves as ‘serious’ or ‘balanced’, giving a ton of space and emphasis to people mourning the one who was shot dead — in a country where gorillas could legally purchase a weapon, were they capable of learning to speak a dozen words — even though the victim was clearly an extremist nutcase.</p>

<p>I’m not advocating for shooting people, but when I was younger, even before the Berlin wall came down, such a case would have been mostly surrounded by silence, or at best relegated to a small article at page 7 of a regional newspaper. Why? Because someone who declares the things that the guy openly said across the years cannot be dignified with a debate. Fascists and their accolites can not be talked with, it’s in the definition. End of.</p>

<p>So yeah, I’m shutting down newspapers, a ton of keywords and more on Mastodon. Would I be exposed to tech discussions only? Not a problem. My main source of reading are my RSS software and a Kobo anyway. I’m sure I’ll be more or less up to date with the current absolute shit show that’s going on in the UK. However, the noise has surpassed the threshold of something even remotely meaningful.</p>

<p>Give me back Jack Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, I’d take it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          
          <p>A <a href="https://social.coop/@dennyhenke/115180769174122780">Mastodon post by Denny Henke</a>, made me realise something that is currently making me really angry. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of Apple enthusiasts are disgusted with Tim Cook and Apple given the recent display of bootlicking.</p>

  <p>I’m going to keep suggesting that we are all free to walk away from Apple’s services. Your next computer can use GNU Linux. And before you dismiss it, have you tried it?  Folks, I promise you, it is possible to have great and productive computing experience over here. The Free Software movement embraces ethical computing with a core respect for users’ freedom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a simple answer, which in fact I published on Mastodon as a reply. While I agree with Denny, I’d suggest to those people that a first step could be to STOP purchasing Apple’s devices every year or so.</p>

<p>If I can manage my entire personal and work activities using a 10-year old Mac laptop, surely a sizeable percentage out there could do the same, instead of supporting Apple’s unsustainable and environmentally criminal release pace.</p>

<p>It seriously drives me nuts, way more than a reluctance to switch to Linux, which could be understandable.</p>

<p>To the ones who might be thinking of a thousand justifications as to why they “need” the brightest and the best latest model of whatever bullshit Tim the Leader Dear is selling now, what I do with my old computer is not “simple office work” or something along those lines. I recorded, produced, mixed and mastered dozens of music albums, authored eight music videos for my debut album, and did everything else — blog, website design and development, bureaucracy, email, video streaming, reading, <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>The fact that a month ago I switched to a 2013 MacBook Pro — even older! — running an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mavericks">operating system</a> that was released in October of that same year, and I’m still able to do the same things as above, even better in some cases, should say something.</p>

<p>Pretty sure the herd mentality out there is impervious to any of these arguments.</p>

        <title>So Be It</title>
        <author>hello@minutestomidnight.co.uk (Simone Silvestroni)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          A year and three months later, a follow-up on <a href='/blog/leaving-the-web-industry/'>leaving the web industry</a>. I was supposed to have distanced myself from that by now, to speak about it lightly. Not true.
          <p class="highlight"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: most of the content for this article comes from a few posts of mine published between 2013 and 2014 on the blog of my then co-directed web design/dev London-based firm. Sometimes things don’t change.</p>

<p>Applying to jobs bearing the title ‘Front-end Developer’ never landed well with me. Seeing how I never accepted the demise of <em>web designer</em>, the imposed division between developers and “UX designers” felt like the fruit of a narrow-minded vision. Without any doubt, it was a large contributor to the multiplication of horrible and unusable web products. As a designer who can code, with an extensive experience, I used to be comfortable in being present at each stage of a web production.</p>

<p>After spending more than two decades working for all kind of clients, building a familiarity with how browsers behave, developing a knack for making simple concepts shine, honing a natural ability to discern the best typography for each situation, I could achieve what I consider a good web design:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creating websites that worked well on any browser, maintaining a visual consistency without obsessing over every cross-platform minute differences.</li>
  <li>Coding with web standards for sustainability, durability, and maintainability.</li>
  <li>Learning WCAG guidelines and ARIA roles enough to make them accessible to everyone.</li>
  <li>Staying away from pointless buzzwords, such as “pixel-perfect”, “above the fold” or any other soundbites constantly regurgitated by every recruiter in the industry — and probably by “AI” now.</li>
  <li>Relentlessly testing my work against the proper validators.</li>
</ol>

<p>Working with the largest clients made me realise what people want, but especially with what they <em>don’t want</em>. That is why I addressed accessibility and performance from the get-go, instead of an afterthought.</p>

<h2 id="reinventing-the-wheel">Reinventing the wheel</h2>

<p>I’ve witnessed many tech fads throughout my career, especially web frameworks, with their cycle of time and energy wasted to learn the stack, only to see it slowly morphing into something different, or simply cease to exist. One recent example being JAMstack, which I kind of welcomed a while ago, before realising that it even had the JAM acronym upside down: familiarity with progressive enhancement would make it evident that Markup should come before APIs, with Javascript as a last step to add interaction, when and if needed. I get it: MAJ would not have given a VC-funded Silicon Valley startup a funky name to extract enough money.</p>

<p>Ironically, while each and every framework shared the same theoretical goal of stop reinventing the wheel, it ended up in a deathly spiral of doing precisely that: reinventing the wheel by using different names and architectural starting points.</p>

<p>I used to be baffled as to why the web industry kept behaving this way, shifting from one fragile cauldron to the next, creating unmaintainable cathedrals on quicksand while trying to reach El Dorado: the ultimate vendor lock-in. With all that’s been happening over the last few years of late-stage capitalism, I now understand <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>Yet, I’ve always preferred to create my design and code ‘system’ — modular, easy to apply and adaptable, based on a solid foundation of accessibility, usability, performance. My work did NOT need Javascript or any progressive enhancement, because it should have been the foundation. Other people were supposed to improve on that, using progressive enhancement if required.</p>

<p>Does this mean that I’m out of the game in today’s upside-down web industry? So be it. Happy to have pivoted out of it. Sitting by the river, watching the dead results passing by: a web full of crap, slow, inaccessibile, fragile, broken. Good riddance. Enjoy your JS-only designers, and the way nobody notices the oxymoron.</p>

<p>My tech stack was made of solid semantic HTML, even when created by either PHP or a static site generator (the Liquid template language, for example), and well-structured CSS. Jeremy Keith said, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/12571"><em>CSS is simple but not easy</em></a>, which is why developers who are not familiar with web standards always fail.</p>

<p>Someone wrote this on their blog — and I’m royally pissed that I didn’t take note of the name, or the URL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind might be a good way to quickly work on prototypes, but they hinder knowledge of CSS. Using them as the foundation for a workflow is the telltale sign of developers who don’t know how to properly approach design and web standards. Web design takes time, care, and proper testing. Trusting frameworks to do the heavy lifting is part of what make websites unusable and inaccessible today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully, I’ll find out the source one day.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          Six months ago, I offered to produce, mix, and master the debut album for a friend. One out of several good reasons to do so was selfish: use their project to complete a process of re-igniting my music production workflow, and rekindle with all the intrinsic mechanisms that are needed for a quality delivery. A process that I had successfully started with <a href='/blog/la-matiere-meme-du-temps/'>Zavajer at the end of last year</a>.
          <p>The idea was to start offering sound production services again, as a side activity. I didn’t think that through. Taking six months for a 6-song album uncovered an obvious problem, especially if compared to how, back in the day, it used to take less than three weeks, including all the back-and-forth with the author, and proper quality testing.</p>

<p>I can go on however I want to find reasons as to why it took me so long, but it boils down to a simple linear truth: I don’t want to do it. Having a day job means that I can only use a few hours here and there, or the weekend, or my holidays, to work on music production. Reality showed me that it’s my free time, time to do personal stuff, enjoy relationships, go visit places, do house chores, et cetera.</p>

<p>Having said that, I’m proud of the album, no matter how my obsessed mind will always consider my work as sub-par. Obsessed by a past standard that’s currently unattainable to me, that I used to achieve because I poured ten hours a day into the craft, every day, for years. Yet, the simple fact of being proud of this new production is a giant step for me. It means starting to accept that perfection is not of this world, and that sometimes <em>good enough</em> is the best for everyone.</p>

<p>A fulfilling explanation of how things are with me and music production came out of a nice discussion with another friend and musician, with whom I’ve been collaborating for almost ten years. We share the same age and a similar living situation, so we found each other agreeing with wanting to savour our free time in peace, without obsessing over having to perform something else at any cost.</p>

<p>We also shared the logical result of the above: turn our focus on our music instead. Having no deadline, whatever and whenever it comes to us, work on new music to keep the flame going. Do we have something to say, something to play? Let’s record that, and produce the outcome at our pace.</p>

<p>Acceptance is sometimes hard, but when it comes it’s satisfying.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          <a href='/blog/nostalgia/'>Adding some flare back</a> to the current uninspiring design of Mac OS wasn't enough. After spending a day using an old Mac running Mavericks, I realised how I probably need to find a tiny place somewhere in the past.
          <p>A certainty formed after a couple of hours playing with my recently acquired 2013 MacBook Air. I hadn’t seen Mac OS X 10.9.5 — the last OS Apple released before deciding to move everything to a flat, boring, and often confusing interface — for more than a decade, and I must say it: it was GUI peak design.</p>

<p>Even though the laptop has only 4 gigs of RAM, I managed to easily install and run Logic Studio 2.1, which included Logic Pro 9.1.8, Soundtrack, Waveburner, and the whole 50-ish GB pro sound package. Then, installing Adobe Creative Suite 4, which looks and behaves great, confirmed a fact: nothing added to later iterations of the software was actually needed — at least from my point of view.</p>

<p>The fact that everything is so incredibly fast and smooth leaves me speechless. To think that I got this machine for free only to have a play with my beloved old Logic Pro 9, it’s now showing how the fenomenon called <em>retro computing</em> has a more meaningful and deep outcome than I previously believed.</p>

<figure class="fullscreen">
	<img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/mavericks-logicstudio-installation.webp" alt="Screenshot of Logic Studio 2 installer in Mac OS X Mavericks" width="1440" height="900" />
	<figcaption>Installing Logic Studio 2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Everything I do on that computer feels like magic somehow. Animations are unobtrusive and perfectly calibrated, the depth of the UI design is very satisfying to the eyes, while interacting with every system component feels quick, intuitive, natural. Even the system typography looks soothing and more readable. Working with Finder results in more clarity compared to any flat design alternative that followed.</p>

<p>Launching Logic and the rest of the audio suite was both a pleasure and a series of why. Why did they have to dumb down everything? The so-called Apple Pro Apps from the Jobs era were amazing, efficient, and easy to use for skilled professionals. The difference between Logic and Garage Band was remarkable, but it had meaning. Same for Final Cut and iMovie: conflating the two to a minimum low denominator, presumably to appease the masses, was absolutely detrimental.</p>

<p>One day I shoud properly analyse why Logic Pro X has always been giving me eye fatigue, while the previous version 9 never did.</p>

<figure class="fullscreen">
	<img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/mavericks-logicpro-9.webp" alt="Screenshot of Logic Pro 9.1.8 showing the demo song" width="1440" height="900" />
	<figcaption>Logic Pro 9.1.8</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another idiocy that I’ve never forgiven Apple for, was the decision to discontinue Soundtrack Pro. I suppose it followed the same path as Aperture, beloved by many photographers: dumbing down everything to conflate a ‘pro’ line to consumer level — Photos.app in this latter example.</p>

<p>Soundtrack Pro, which featured a dual mode (multitrack and single track audio editor), was an absolute favourite during my sound design years. It was never replaced.</p>

<figure class="fullscreen">

	<figcaption>Soundtrack Pro, multitrack mode</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="back-in-time">Back in time</h2>

<p>After my latest two posts, adding whimsical flare to the flat macOS was not enough for me. I had a look at old OS versions before Apple completely lost the plot with Big Sur, and noticed how, up until Catalina, Finder windows still had gradients and depth. Clarity was at least still in part present.</p>

<p>So, of course I went back to Catalina (10.15.7) on my daily drive. Catalina received its last security patch 2 years ago. I don’t really care. I keep the WiFi off for most of my day anyway, I run Little Snitch and a firewall, I’m not worried.</p>

<p>What has the Mavericks experiment showed me? That I grew up in a world where designers cared about their work, and also about the people who would end up using such work. Also, it demonstrated, in a direct and somehow brutal way, how every single so-called improvement that came later was mostly redundant, likely a marketing gimmick forced to sell more crap.</p>

<p>While I started the experiment for a single reason: creating and producing a single song on Logic 9 to prove that music gear is secondary to creativity, I might end up looking for a powerful old Mac hardware where I can run Mac OS X 10.9.5 and use software from 15 years ago for all my activities. Most of it is considered abandonware, but it still works better than any new incarnation, and it can export to the same universal formats.</p>

<p>I fear that, faced with the current shit show in the tech world, going back is the only sane way to survive.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          Over the last ten years or so, a dominant theme has been nostalgia. While initially convinced it was strictly related to my personal struggle with ageing, I've now changed my mind.
          <p>A constant in my journal, a constant in other people’s blogs and posts on the Fediverse, the accompanying creeping malaise doesn’t seem to only affect Gen Xers and their process of getting old. It’s everywhere, online, offline, in personal conversations, in magazine essays, books, podcasts. It’s like every facet of our present has been touched by some dystopian Midas king, who turns everything to shit.</p>

<p>Apple, once a rebel outcast of sorts, has become the dark menacing big brother from their famous 1984 Macintosh ad. Google’s founding motto, <em>Don’t be evil</em>, is so obviously an oxymoron by now that they’ve removed it from everywhere.</p>

<p>The internet, once a safe exciting place for creativity, exchange, discovery and personal growth, is now a gigantic commercial jail, an over-complex intricate web of honey pots built for surveillance and exploitation.</p>

<p>What appear to be the last embers of capitalism have extended their grasp on everything, online and offline, taking control of people’s choices, language, thoughts, and especially wallets. The image of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/139439-there-will-be-no-curiosity-no-enjoyment-of-the-process">a boot stamping on a human face forever</a> comes to mind. Only, as I keep saying, we’re not in Orwellian territory here — that would have been too transparent for capitalism. We’re in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brave-New-World">Huxley territory</a>. This is a twisted version of <em>Brand New World</em>.</p>

<p>Masses have accepted a crippling addiction to modern crap technology as if it’s normal. Technology that’s built — on purpose or not — to be devoid of any attempt of aiding spontaneous human interactions. Nothing is maintainable, nor built to last. It needs to be disposable in the worst possible consumeristic sense: constantly replaced, year after year, by the next “best” version of itself.</p>

<p>Huxley used the concept of Ford’s assembly line as the metaphor for dispotic efficiency. Isn’t the cult of productivity today revered and relentlessly <a href="https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/03/continuous-productivity-is-toxic/">pushed down everyone’s throat</a> as a way to achieve wealth, success and ultimately power?</p>

<p>I was truly speechless when I saw the latest Apple’s pretentious and hollow staged presentation at WWDC. It felt like it had reached its dystopian nadir when the horrifying AI vocal assistant spewed fake praises and platitudes in a person’s headset after a run. Realising how they shot the scene without an inch of irony left me stunned. No episode of <em>Black Mirror</em> ever hit me with such strength: at least I’d know it’s a work of fantasy, while this shit is real.</p>

<p>The internet as I knew it from 1995 to 2005 is probably mostly gone, barely saved by these tiny pouches of niche writers, who keep posting on their personal sites, trying to stay afloat among oceans of SEO scams, ads, tracking, data leaks, and the constant siphoning of personal data. Let’s not dive into “social” media giants, carelessly involved in genocides and political jerrymandering on each side of the Atlantic and beyond.</p>

<p>And then, the crushing push of standardisation everywhere. Design isn’t a creative field anymore, let’s not fool ourselves. Except the above niche of stubborn individuals, and little communities here and there, everything has been flattened and homogenised. 95% of all the websites I’ve seen over the last decade is a cookie-cut template, spawned out of one of a million overcomplicated frameworks out there, built to constantly reinvent the wheel and destroy the very fabric of what made the web interesting and fun.</p>

<p>Over the last couple days I stumbled upon a few examples.</p>

<h2 id="web-design">Web Design</h2>

<p>Like many of my peers, I vividly remember when the world of web design was turned upside down by a collective who campaigned to stop the so-called browser wars, to impose web standards over the drift of software giants’ proprietary crap. They called themselves <em>The Web Standards Project</em>. From their last blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When The Web Standards Project (WaSP) formed in 1998, the web was the battleground in an ever-escalating war between two browser makers—Netscape and Microsoft—who were each taking turns “advancing” HTML to the point of collapse. You see, in an effort to one-up each other, the two browsers introduced new elements and new ways of manipulating web documents; this escalated to the point where their respective 4.0 versions were largely incompatible.<cite><a href="https://www.webstandards.org/2013/03/01/our-work-here-is-done/index.html">Aaron Gustafson</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back then, together with <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com">Silvia</a> and a few friends and colleagues, I started to apply strict rules of usability and accessibility to my work, making large use of web standards and guidelines. A source of constant inspiration was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Zeldman">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>. His books, along with the websites he designed or contributed to design, were at the forefront of my learning process. I loved his style, liked the things he wrote, and followed his example.</p>

<p>This is Zeldman’s homepage in 2005:</p>

<p class="fullscreen"><img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/jeffrey-zeldman-presents-the-daily-report-2005.webp" alt="The Daily Report, screenshot from the Web Archive" width="1942" height="1582"></p>

<p>Over the last 6 years, Zeldman’s website used one of the default WordPress themes, <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty/">Twenty Twenty</a>, a cookie-cut template. Apparently, he’s been working on a custom redesign, which is almost ready to go online. My point is that he stopped being an example, and decided to adapt to the flat homogenised world of modular scalable anonymous nothingness.</p>

<p>Out of transparency: I too used Twenty Twenty for a few months when it came out, quickly getting tired of it due to a simple fact: it didn’t feel mine.</p>

<p>The personal consequence of gutting the web of creativity, personal flare and diversity is simple: I now only enjoy small websites, part of what is commonly called small (or Indie) web. Anything else goes straight to my RSS reader, or gets ignored.</p>

<h2 id="music-concerts">Music Concerts</h2>

<p>A week ago, Live Aid has reached its 40th anniversary. Silvia and I have been watching sets from the various places (Wembley, Philadelphia) and something suddenly hit me. The stage was neither small nor gigantic, with a very simple set up: a white static background showing the iconic guitar-shaped Africa silhouette, a static banner saying ‘FEED THE WORLD - July 13th 1985 at WEMBLEY STADIUM’, again the logo over the left and right speakers, and nothing else. Maybe a couple sponsors here and there, Pepsi being among them, but nothing really overwhelming.</p>

<p class="fullscreen"><img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/live-aid.webp" alt="Photo of the stage at Wembley stadium while David Bowie performs live" width="615" height="433"></p>

<p>On stage, high quality acts performed everything live: no autotune, no pre-recorded crap. Everything kept simple and real. Artists looking spontaneous, happy to improvise and stretch their songs longer than the canonical three minutes. Normal and fun clothes, no pretentious gigantic dancing crews or pointless laser shows. Then, from the stage it’s easy to observe the massive crowds: how happy they were, just by being there and enjoy the shows. They moved their arms left and right, clapped on beat, sang. No lights from phone torches, no time wasted taking crap videos or selfies. They were there, <em>committed to the moment</em>.</p>

<p>The personal consequence of how things have changed is that I completely avoid going to live gigs. The last time I truly enjoyed a concert in person was more than ten years ago. Mike Peters of the Alarm, in a London club. Might have been because the crowd was full of Gen X like me, but nobody had a mobile phone in their hands, and everyone sang with Mike.</p>

<h2 id="os-interfaces">OS Interfaces</h2>

<p>As I wrote abundantly over the last few years, I jumped across operating systems and platforms, looking for something that does not exist, at least for me. What did I notice? When Microsoft changed its design to a flat aesthetic, and sadly Apple followed suit with iOS 7 and Mac OS Yosemite, everyone else jumped on board.</p>

<p>Just look at this simple example. iOS logos across time:</p>

<p><img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/ios-involution.webp" alt="All iOS version logos from 1 to 14, 2007-2020" width="1440" height="1440"></p>

<p>Easy to spot the watershed moment: the first six iterations had their own personality and a distinct look, while the following versions simply drown in the indistinguishable minimalistic cookie-cut approach.</p>

<p>Everything is now flat; depth, shadows and gradients have been removed, along with the ability to easily use the interface to navigate a system. Readability seems unimportant, accessibility a second thought. Even a large part of desktop environments in Linux decided to go with this flow. Zorin OS’ bright interface is blinding to me, while its dark mode unnervingly hard to use, and this is a mere example.</p>

<p>Then, a few weeks ago, I installed Mac OS X 10.9 ‘Mavericks’ on an old 2010 MacBook Air. Two things immediately stood out: depth, gradients, shadows, real buttons, real links, were all incredibly easier to spot and use properly. Readability massively better across the system, along with a feeling of being treated like a normal person. Instead of imposing a flat uninspiring interface, only to dumb down everything else in order to help people using their crap, Apple used to be way less patronising. During installation, I was never presented with the ridiculous choice “Yes/Maybe later” — instead, they asked a question, offering a yes/no possibility. How refreshing!</p>

<p>Silvia and I have been reading a lot of <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/rose-gold-tinted-liquid-glasses.html">Louie Mantia</a> lately. I knew him from his past work, and used to have his icons back in the day. Louie’s latest rants truly resonated with us, prompting a decision to restore some whimsicality to our Macs. I have now <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lickable-menu-bar/id6444217677?mt=12">an Aqua look</a> for my menu bar:</p>

<p><img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/lickable-menu.webp" alt="Screenshot of the left side of my Mac OS menu bar" width="964" height="214"></p>

<p>Used <a href="https://www.macenhance.com/iconchamp.html">Icon Champ</a> to replace the default flat icons with past versions or their current actual logos, without the rounded square constraint that looks so innatural on Mac:</p>

<p><img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/system-apps.webp" alt="Screenshot of the application Icon Champ showing a list of customised icons" width="2166" height="1646"></p>

<p>Used Louie’s ‘Forstall folders’ <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/icons/">icon sets</a> to make my Finder fun to look at:</p>

<p><img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/home.webp" alt="Screenshot of my home folder showing custom purple icons" width="1690" height="960"></p>

<p>Turned my Monterey’s horrible Dock into something lively:</p>

<p><img src="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/assets/images/dock.webp" alt="Screenshot of my Dock showing custom irregular icons" width="1472" height="212"></p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Maybe it’s just nostalgia, but I have a strong feeling that a series of interconnected bad decisions are responsible for something that has turned almost everything to a worse version of itself.</p>

<p>I’ll leave with another of Louie’s observations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all of this to be largely dictated by a person who has little-to-no support amongst industry experts? I frankly can’t believe it. No one I know would ask Alan Dye to design their app. Adopting Liquid Glass is no different. Why would anyone subscribe to a design system created by a person you don’t consider to be a good designer? <cite>Louie Mantia, <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html">A Responsibility to the Industry</a></cite></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          <a href='/blog/moving-on/'>I undid it</a>. Leaving Linux to go back to Mac OS after several months was something that I did not foresee. However, this thing is more nuanced, and it's not the end of the line.
          <p>Technically, I had never left Mac OS, as I kept my MacBook Pro on Monterey (offline) for music production anyway. So, what happened? In a nutshell, it’s pretty simple. I used Linux as a daily ride for months, on a 2015 MacBook Air, and I loved it. Until my eyes got strained, and the machine started to get progressively sluggish. Jumping from distro to distro failed to solve the decaying performance situation. To be fair, the MacBook Air had zero hardware issues with Linux — I even managed to have its FaceTime camera working during live video calls — but the non-retina tiny screen took a toll that I had not anticipated.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I managed to get a large 27” old-ish iMac from the office, to be used when working from home. That’s where I now have migrated any music production activities. While I was very much looking forward to freeing my retina 15” MacBook Pro to become my improved Linux machine, reality hit differently. I suppose it might be due to the machine’s internal workings, a dual Intel/ATI Radeon GPU, different hardware components. I have tried everything, again across multiple Linux distributions, but the machine never managed to sail straight like its tiny less powerful Air twin. Fans problems, cooling issues, unnerving crashes, random restarts, kernel panicking.</p>

<p>I also got slightly annoyed at the ever-changing idiosyncrasies between desktop environments, the disconnected plethora of different package distributors, extensions and whatnot. However, that was never a deal breaker. I figured I just need to settle on a distro, a desktop environment, a reduced selection of add-ons and configurations, and focus on that.</p>

<p>Which, in the end, I did.</p>

<p>While Linux is not my daily ride anymore, I’ve been happily juggling a hybrid situation where my MacBook Pro running Mac OS Monterey (mostly offline) is paired with the MacBook Air, now running Debian 12 <em>Bookworm</em> (mostly online). This set up has been quite stable and working very well. The two computers are mostly interchangeable. However, what decades with Mac OS have shown to me is how much I do appreciate a smooth workflow. Like it or not, Mac OS, when set up and used sensibly, is a damn stable and efficient Unix system, with a great — albeit ruined by vindictive engineers — consistent GUI.</p>

<h2 id="a-major-personal-realisation">A major personal realisation</h2>

<p>Observing the way I’ve used my tech over the last year or so, one thing is clear: it has drastically changed. I don’t feel a problem using Mac OS — even though my deep hate for Apple is not going anywhere — mostly because I’ve been moving away so much from their way of doing computing that it’s now just another Unix <em>distribution</em> to me.</p>

<p>Looking at this granularly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t use their software, other than Text Edit and Preview.</li>
  <li>Every time I’m online with Mac OS, I make sure that Little Snitch catches and blocks everything I don’t want to be near to. Including iCloud shit, Apple News crap, or anything that they’ve been working hard for their dystopian walled garden. Little Snitch is coupled with a pretty restrictive hosts file.</li>
  <li>Of course anything remotely connected to trackers and/or ads gets zapped at the source in the browser.</li>
  <li>Notifications are close to zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above is coupled with my hardware situation: a 2015 MacBook Pro, 10-year old, repaired and maintained multiple times (screen, battery, logic board, SSD drive); a 2015 MacBook Air, 10-year old, acquired for free. Finally, a Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 from 2019, 6-year old, running Lineage OS 21 (Android 14). Fully de-Googled, with an always-on system-wide tracker blocker that’s zapping anything at the source. The only notifications come from my alarm, the phone application, and Signal. Its battery capacity is still at 98.9%, which translates to 2.5 days of use before recharging.</p>

<p>I won’t be purchasing anything new from Apple, or any other vile ultra-capitalist conglomerate. I’ll keep using old hardware while it works. I also know that any future choice will be facilitated by knowing how easily I can switch between OSes.</p>

<p>I don’t feel the need for hortodoxy or ideology at this stage of my life, the only thing I was looking for was principles, and freedom. My current setup sounds like curated freedom, and it feels good.</p>
