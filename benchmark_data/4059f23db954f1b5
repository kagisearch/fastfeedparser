 &lt;big&gt;
 Every year, for over half my life, I have received an automated email
 wishing me a happy birthday from the Dynamic Drive Forums. Every year,
 it's been a constant little reminder of where I came from and where
 my whole career kicked off.
 &lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest email in my archives mentioning Dynamic Drive is dated July 2008
(which would make me 12 years old at the time), and the last forum thread reply
was in late-2010. Three years seems like a short period of my life, but it&amp;rsquo;s
hard to convey just how foundational this time was for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I can only do one thing at a time.</title><link>/articles/one-thing-at-a-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/one-thing-at-a-time/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I was obsessed with building out the best &amp;ldquo;battlestation&amp;rdquo; I could. At one point, my home office desk had five monitors and three computers on it. I even bought software (&lt;a href="https://symless.com/synergy"&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt;!) so I could use one keyboard and mouse between all of them seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That must&amp;rsquo;ve been my best setup then, right? The one I lust over, think about, try and recreate all these years later?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Do you know where your domains are?</title><link>/articles/where-your-domains-live/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/where-your-domains-live/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the past several years I have used &lt;code&gt;blackie.me&lt;/code&gt; as an email domain for myself and my family, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a great, short, memorable domain for personal email. But there&amp;rsquo;s one caveat that sticks in the back of my mind&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the English interpretation of &lt;code&gt;.me&lt;/code&gt;, the top-level domain (TLD) is actually the country code for Montenegro, a Balkan state born out of the breakup of Yugoslavia. It has had a remarkable modernization since its declaration of independence in 2006, and is currently in the late stages of ascension to the EU.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Importance of Structure</title><link>/articles/the-importance-of-structure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/the-importance-of-structure/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been self-employed for just over a year, and in the beginning I really
struggled to stay productive. But I found the secret: “be your own boss” should
be taken literally; set expectations for yourself that a boss would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My days start at 8am. I block out time for walks, lunch, deep focus tasks,
journalling… I’m not micro-managing my day or going into 5-minute increments,
I’m just giving myself a light framework around my average workday.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Drummers Still Exist</title><link>/articles/drummers-still-exist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/drummers-still-exist/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;
	Ten years before humans landed on the moon, the Wurlitzer company released a machine capable of producing automated
	drum-like noises called the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://120years.net/the-side-manwurlitzerusa1959/"&gt;Side Man&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;
	This device was the first &amp;#8220;drum machine,&amp;#8221; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808"&gt;its
		spiritual successors&lt;/a&gt;
	would define entire new genres of music.
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decades since the Side Man, humanity finally solved the rhythm section. These advancements in technology
	ushered in a new era where the role of &amp;#8220;drummer&amp;#8221; was put to rest as its duties were relegated to the
	machines. After all, these days, what band would pay a salary to a human to do what a cheap box has been able to do
	for years?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Email Authenticity 101: DKIM, DMARC, and SPF</title><link>/articles/email-authenticity-dkim-spf-dmarc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/email-authenticity-dkim-spf-dmarc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;big&gt;
 Password resets, two factor codes, business secrets, private
 conversations&amp;hellip; Email is at the centre of most of life and
 business, and so we must ensure it is trustworthy and authentic.
 &lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 If you use email with your own domain, a lot of the burden of authenticity
 has suddenly shifted from your service provider to you. This guide will
 hopefully give you the information and practices you need to keep your
 domain's email authentic and less vulnerable to spoofing.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;
 In the world of private codebases, and especially SaaS, you can easily
 fall into the trap of thinking, "well, it's OK because no one is going
 to see this." A mindset like that can wreck a codebase, and can fuel
 micro-decisions that lead to painful long-term mistakes.
 &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 First, regarding "productisation," &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=productization&amp;oldid=51827427"&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt; defines it as
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;The act of modifying something, such as a concept or a tool internal to
			an organization, to make it suitable as a commercial product.&lt;/em&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
 To put it another way, I find it very helpful to frame things from the
 perspective of "what if someone else had to run this software?" This is
 obviously something that open source projects have to think about quite
 a bit, so you could also frame it as "what if this was open source?"
 &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Build Worse Software</title><link>/articles/trying-to-be-worse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/trying-to-be-worse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One of my first software projects &amp;ndash; probably the first project I did that
wasn&amp;rsquo;t just building a website theme &amp;ndash; was building my own CMS. The year was
2010, I was a middle school student doing web design on the side, and I was
tired of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of this project from time to time; usually I remember how much I
enjoyed building it. I used this custom CMS for some local business websites
during my consulting days. The project was just a pile of procedural PHP
scripts, with HTML and PHP just smashed together. MySQL was the database of
choice, with unprepared SQL strings littered everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Generating Static Sites with Make and Bash</title><link>/articles/static-site-bash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/static-site-bash/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When you think of &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, you may not consider it suitable for
building websites. For the most part, you are probably correct. But I
wanted to try anyway. I don&amp;rsquo;t buy into most trends in the frontend web
development community, so literally none of the &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; static site
generators appeal to me. All of them feel overcomplicated, too niche, or
too javascript-y for my needs, which involve &lt;em&gt;just rendering a
website&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Review of the Dell Latitude 7214</title><link>/articles/dell-7214/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>alex@blackie.ca (Alex Blackie)</author><guid>/articles/dell-7214/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;
	For many years now, Lenovo Thinkpads have been a mainstay in my life; their
	no-nonsense, practical offering greatly appealed to what I wanted in a
	machine. Its shortcomings in weight, thickness, and aesthetic were all areas
	I was more than happy to trade for superb battery life, port abundance, and
	"in the field" features like Power Bridge Batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	However, Lenovo has been slowly turning Thinkpads into mainstream consumer
	trash. I found myself in want of a new laptop recently and found the
	entirety of the modern Thinkpad lineup revolting. The X280 is a disgrace to
	its namesake, the X1 Carbon makes way too many vain compromises for its thin
	profile, and everything else was either too big or too absurd for my needs
	(eg., the P71 fits both of those descriptors). I found myself at a loss,
	unsure of where to turn now that my beloved Thinkpads were spoiled by
	marketing and consumer trends.

	&lt;strong&gt;Update 2018-07&lt;/strong&gt;: As of July 2018 DigitalOcean &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/release-notes/2018/private-networking/"&gt;has begun rolling out&lt;/a&gt; true private networking that is isolated per-account. This is a great step forward, and I sincerely hope other VPS providers follow suit. Until then, this post is still relevant for basically every other provider.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 A while ago I deployed a blog using DigitalOcean's infrastructure. I used
 separate droplets for the database and web tier, and used the "private IP"
 feature to only allow MySQL traffic over that interface. I noticed the
 private network seemed larger than necessary for just hosting my own stuff,
 so I did a little digging.

	Consumer ISPs are some of my least favourite companies to deal with. Their
	arrogance and lack of competent support makes for an infinitely-frustrating
	experience for someone like me who has managed a network or two. The pain of
	contacting support with very specific, technical explanations of the exact
	problem you're experiencing only to be told to "restart your PC" makes one's
	hair begin to fade.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	I recently moved from the west coast of Canada to the east, and one of the
	benefits gained there was fibre-to-the-apartment availability (something the
	west is just &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; beginning to know). Coming from a history of
	cable modems, I was excited to see what was different. I had always dreamed
	of replacing the cable modem with some sort of PCI card in my 1U rack server
	I use for a router, but the complexities involved were always not worth it.
	Fibre, however, is a common standard in datacenter-grade equipment, so I was
	looking forward to maybe finally being able to bypass the horrid consumer
	trashbox Bell was likely to give me.

	Docker and other containerization technologies are making the rounds in the
	Linux community, but a lowly hero lurks beneath now every major Linux
	distro; enter &lt;code&gt;systemd-nspawn&lt;/code&gt; containers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	systemd has arrived with mixed reviews -- you either love it or you hate it
	-- but one thing stands for certain: it gets the job done. Regardless of
	your emotions projected towards it, systemd is likely here to stay for a
	while, so you might as well exploit as many features as you can out of it.

This scared me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first question was: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;How did Facebook know I have a hotmail address?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;.
