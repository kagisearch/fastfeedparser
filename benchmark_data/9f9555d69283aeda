<p>E.U. leaders are pushing for increased European sovereignty in the midst of frayed relations with the United States.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We want to cut through knots, we want to find solutions always with the goal of strengthening Europe&#8217;s sovereignty and making Europe strong. This is a very European moment,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-countries-should-not-hide-behind-national-interests-german-finmin-says-2026-02-16/"  target="_blank">said German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil</a> on Monday.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;I believe what happened at the beginning of the year with Greenland, woke up everyone who cares about Europe, and it is leading to the fact that we are not getting bogged down in national interests or hiding behind them, but ready to make compromises,&#8221; he continued, referencing President Donald <a href="https://time.com/7353359/trump-greenland-annexation-no-going-back-united-kingdom-argument/" >Trump&rsquo;s push to acquire Greenland,</a> which saw him briefly threaten to tariff European countries who opposed his efforts.</p>



<p>Klingbeil made the comments before a meeting of E.U. finance ministers in Brussels, according to Reuters.</p>



<p>His encouragement towards Europe&rsquo;s self-reliance comes after Kaja Kallas, the European Commission&#8217;s high representative for foreign affairs, hit back at remarks made by the U.S. Secretary of State Marco <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-at-the-munich-security-conference"  target="_blank">Rubio at the Munich Security Conference</a> over the weekend.</p>



<p>In her own address on Sunday, Kallas <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/keynote-speech-hrvp-kaja-kallas-msc-europeans-assemble-reclaiming-agency-rougher-world_en"  target="_blank">told</a> the audience: &ldquo;Contrary to what some may say&mdash;woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;In fact, people still want to join our club. And not just fellow Europeans. When I was in Canada last year I was told that over 40% of Canadians have an interest in joining the E.U.,&rdquo; she claimed. &ldquo;The waiting list is getting long. I just hope those who have been waiting for quite some time would not have to wait for longer.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Those who are already members want their union to take a stronger role in the world: To defend our values. To take care of our people. To push humanity forwards,&rdquo; she said, later adding that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1616711966141626"  target="_blank">European bashing</a>&rdquo; is currently &ldquo;very in fashion.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Kallas&rsquo; remarks appeared to be in response to <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-at-the-munich-security-conference"  target="_blank">Rubio&rsquo;s speech from</a> the day before, during which he said the U.S. will always be &ldquo;a child of Europe,&rdquo; but also issued a warning about perceived incoming threats.</p>



<p>He claimed that &ldquo;acting together&rdquo; will &ldquo;restore to us a clearer sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The notion of &ldquo;civilizational erasure&rdquo; in Europe was also put forward in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf"  target="_blank">U.S. national security strategy report</a> in November, which claimed that policy decisions, including those on migration, from E.U. nations was having a detrimental impact.</p>



<p>European policies are &ldquo;creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence,&rdquo; the report claimed.</p>



<p>In Munich, although Rubio offered a more conciliatory tone in comparison to Vice President J.D. <a href="https://time.com/7275834/trump-and-vance-have-accidentally-united-europe/" >Vance&rsquo;s speech from last year&rsquo;s conference</a>, he repeatedly warned of the dangers of &ldquo;mass migration&rdquo; and said &ldquo;we must gain control of our national borders.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;If at times we disagree, our disagreements come from our profound sense of concern about a Europe with which we are connected&mdash;not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally.  We want Europe to be strong,&rdquo; said Rubio, encouraging a united approach moving forward.</p>



<p>European leaders, meanwhile, expressed concern over transatlantic relations throughout the conference.</p>



<p>Danish Prime Minister <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAC2RcHfQE8"  target="_blank">Mette Frederiksen expressed</a> her belief that Trump&rsquo;s interest in Greenland &ldquo;is not over.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately I think the desire is the same&hellip; I would also add that I think the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable. We are talking about threats, but the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone,&rdquo; she said, maintaining that there are &ldquo;red lines that will not be crossed,&rdquo; with a solution still being discussed.</p>



<p>Prior to Rubio&rsquo;s speech, German Chancellor Friedrich <a href="https://time.com/7378512/united-states-europe-divide-warning-merz-trump-rubio/" >Merz warned of a &ldquo;deep rift&rdquo;</a> between the U.S. and Europe.</p>



<p>Merz argued that the U.S. &ldquo;will not be powerful enough to go it alone&rdquo; in the future and urged everyone to &ldquo;repair and revive transatlantic trust together.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Referencing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOsgfINdKg"  target="_blank">Vance&rsquo;s address</a> from last year&rsquo;s conference, in which the Vice President targeted Europe&rsquo;s idea of free speech, Merz told the Munich audience: &ldquo;The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours&hellip; Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/winter-olympics-2030-2034-next-where.jpg" alt="FRANCE-OLY-2030-FRENCH ALPS"/>



<p>The Winter Olympics returned to Italy this year for the first time in two decades. And they&rsquo;re set to bring new triumphs and losses to more familiar ground in the years ahead, from France to the United States.</p>



<p>In the more than a century since they were <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/faq/history-and-origin-of-the-games/when-were-the-first-olympic-winter-games-held"  target="_blank">first held</a> in Chamonix, France, in 1924, the Winter Games have been hosted by <a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/Olympic-Games/Factsheets/The-Olympic-Winter-Games.pdf"  target="_blank">21 cities</a> across 13 different countries. Two Italian cities are playing host to the 2026 Winter Games: Milan, which has never had the honor before, and Cortina d&rsquo;Ampezzo, which has become just the fourth city to host the Winter Olympics more than once.&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Some of the cities that will be hosting future Winter Games have already been announced as well, including another that will join the exclusive list of cities to host the Winter Olympics twice. Here&rsquo;s where the Games are heading next.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2030</strong></h2>



<p>The 2030 Winter Olympics are set to take place in the French Alps from Feb. 1-17, marking the fourth time France has hosted the Winter Games. France has also hosted three Summer Games, all in Paris.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The vision of the Games is to unite the north and south French Alps and make them a hub for winter sport,&rdquo; the official website for the 2030 Games <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/olympic-games/french-alps-2030-vision"  target="_blank">reads</a>. That year&rsquo;s Games will take place in part of the largest interconnected ski area on the planet, running over about 600 km. The Olympic events will be held in Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Brian&ccedil;on, and Nice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2034</strong></h2>



<p>Utah will host the 2034 Winter Olympics from Feb. 10-26. The state capital, Salt Lake City, will be &ldquo;at the heart&rdquo; of the Games, after previously serving as the host in 2002, but competitions will also be held in other communities nearby, according to the official <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/utah-2034-marks-3-000-days-to-go-with-new-name-and-statewide-engagement-push"  target="_blank">website</a>. The upcoming Games will be held entirely in pre-existing or temporary venues, including some used in 2002, according to the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/olympic-games/salt-lake-city-utah-2034-sport"  target="_blank">website</a>.</p>



<p>2034 will mark the fifth time that the U.S. has been the host country for the Winter Games. The country has also hosted four Summer Olympics, and will add a fifth in 2028 when the Games return to Los Angeles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2038 and 2042</strong></h2>



<p>Host cities haven&rsquo;t yet been selected for the 2038 and 2042 Games, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/faq/electing-olympic-hosts/when-will-the-next-hosts-for-the-olympic-summer-games-and-olympic-winter-games-be-elected"  target="_blank">in talks</a> with Switzerland to possibly host the 2038 Games.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260141820.jpg" alt="JAPAN-POLITICS-VOTE"/>



<p>She is the first woman to lead Japan after decades of rule by older men. She is keen to revise her country&rsquo;s pacifist constitution and rebuild its military. She favors big government and public spending to spur growth. She is an unabashed conservative who prefers strict immigration controls.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>And now, after <a href="https://time.com/7372956/japan-takaichi-election-win/" >a record breaking</a> election victory last week, she is stronger than ever, having called a snap election and led her party to winning 316 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Japan&rsquo;s parliament&mdash;the largest seat total since the party&rsquo;s inception in 1955. </p>



<p>Japan has been struggling with a pervasive sense of stagnation and disillusionment born of decades of deflation, wage stagnation, demographic decline and a creeping loss of confidence in the country&rsquo;s place in the world. </p>



<p>Takaichi won by offering a message of hope and a vision for a brighter future. She rallied voters eager to believe that their hardworking leader could deliver on the promise of renewal. The landslide triumph gives Takaichi an overwhelming mandate and clears the way for her to enact a sweeping agenda of economic and security reforms that could transform Japan, the fourth largest economy in the world and the most important American ally in Asia.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">It is morning again in Japan</h3>



<p>Takaichi, a veteran conservative lawmaker, who was<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/04/world/asia/sanae-takaichi-japan.html"  target="_blank"> elected</a> president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and prime minister in Oct. 2025, was riding high in the polls, with<a href="https://perryworldhouse.upenn.edu/news-and-insight/understanding-japans-snap-elections/"  target="_blank"> approval ratings</a> hovering around 70%, when she announced a snap election in January. But after a mere three months in office, she had little in the way of a record to brag about. </p>



<p>What she did have was a carefully curated, dynamic image drawing on the media management skills of her mentor: Shinzo Abe, the influential Japanese leader, who was assassinated in 2022. Her first weeks in office were a flurry of activity: attending summits overseas, hosting President Donald Trump in Japan, making policy pronouncements and managing to pass a supplemental budget that had plenty of sweeteners for voters.</p>



<p>Surging prices for food and fuel over the previous year had battered Japanese households already pressed by stagnant wages and low pensions. She<a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16173733"  target="_blank"> offered</a> cash handouts to families, subsidies for household energy bills, and rice coupons. She slashed the gasoline tax and targeted inflation, the main concern of voters. Takaichi&rsquo;s countermeasures brought timely relief and won over skeptics.</p>



<p>The snap election&mdash;a calculated wager to preempt economic headwinds and voter disenchantment&mdash;caught the opposition unprepared. The election was unmistakably a referendum on Takaichi&rsquo;s qualities and decisiveness, posing the question to Japan&rsquo;s voters: Whom do you trust? Takaichi or her hapless opponents?  </p>



<p>It was not a very hard choice. The Centrist Reform Alliance, the main<a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202602/11/WS698c5aa5a310d6866eb38bea.html"  target="_blank"> opposition party</a>, formed in January after the merger of two older parties. It was led by Yoshiko Noda, a staid veteran politician, who briefly served as an undistinguished prime minister in 2012 and led his party to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/world/asia/conservative-liberal-democratic-party-nearing-a-return-to-power-in-japan.html"  target="_blank"> a crushing defeat</a> at the hands of Shinzo Abe and the LDP. On his watch, relations with the United States nosedived, and his actions sparked tensions with Beijing over the disputed Senkaku Islands&mdash;frictions that have escalated ever since. The CRA suffered a humiliating defeat, as did other centrist and leftist parties.</p>



<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s<a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/02/09/japan/politics/sanae-takaichi-ldp-lower-house-election/"  target="_blank"> popularity with voters</a> helped more than 90% of LDP candidates win their seats, including 41 out of 43 of her colleagues who overcame the stain of financial scandals to secure voter support. She outmaneuvered her opponents by appropriating their policies on immigration<a href="https://japantoday.com/category/politics/japan-pm's-tax-giveaway-roils-markets-and-worries-voters"  target="_blank"> and cut taxes</a> on food. Even with an<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/japan/japans-stalled-immigration-experiment"  target="_blank"> immigrant population</a> of a mere three percent, xenophobic sentiment has been growing in Japan.</p>



<p>Takaichi recognized that Japan, with its aging population, needs foreign workers, but that it needs to control the inflow. She unveiled new immigration controls, reassured voters about the situation, and ensured immigration did not dominate the campaign. It was also one of the shortest campaign periods ever, and despite winter the voter turnout at 56% was higher than in the 2024 election.  This was unmistakably her victory.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260111476.jpg" alt="Takaichi Needs Votes From a Party That's Shunned Her to Win Big" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The economic challenge</h3>



<p>Takaichi began her first term in office by promoting a modified version of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/business/japan-shinzo-abe-economy.html"  target="_blank">Abenomics</a>,&rdquo; relying heavily on government spending financed by debt. Already Japan&rsquo;s public debt had risen to roughly $9 trillion&mdash;240% of GDP or<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/business/japan-debt.html"  target="_blank"> more than double</a> the size of its economy. New borrowing<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-passes-118-billion-extra-budget-fund-its-biggest-post-covid-stimulus-2025-12-16/"  target="_blank"> funded</a> 40% of the 2025<a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16228682"  target="_blank"> supplementary budget</a>, pushing the national debt to a record high. Financial markets took fright: bond yields spiked and the yen slid. For ordinary Japanese, the consequences were tangible: higher mortgage rates and rising prices, as a weaker currency drove up the cost of imported food and fuel.</p>



<p>But the prime minister showed no sign of fiscal restraint. Her promise to cut taxes on food threatens to reduce government revenue further, worsening the deficit. She vows to abandon what she calls &ldquo;excessive austerity&rdquo; and channel strategic investments to 17 industries, promising to revive the economy and deliver a brighter future. Takaichi remains vague on how all this will be funded, though she has tried to reassure markets that she will pursue disciplined fiscal policies. Her wildly optimistic logic is that fiscal stimulus will spark growth, and that the private sector will raise long-stagnant wages, thereby increasing tax revenues.</p>



<p>The stock market has soared in anticipation of lavish public spending, but bond markets remain wary. Her plan for strategic investments is also raising questions about the likely effectiveness of such state intervention. And her rush to boost defense spending to meet White House targets is fueling concern that a numbers-driven process may prove counterproductive in terms of what Japan actually needs to enhance its military capacity.</p>



<p>As she juggles priorities in a rapidly aging society, the spotlight is on<a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/12/27/japan-approves-record-budget-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba-aging-population/"  target="_blank"> surging medical care and pension payments</a>, which account for roughly one third of the budget. These costs are defrayed by the consumption tax&mdash;which Takaichi promises to slash on food&mdash;and by income taxes paid by a shrinking labor force. Other rapidly aging societies face a similar conundrum: require workers to pay higher taxes to maintain social security, or pare back benefits and make seniors pay more for medical treatment. The other option is to mortgage the future by borrowing, the politically easiest path, and one she seems to favor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Out of China&#8217;s shadow</h3>



<p>A great dream of Shinzo Abe was to convince the people of Japan to abandon unilateral pacifism and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/asia/japan-constitution-shinzo-abe-military.html"  target="_blank"> restore</a> the country to a position of military strength. Takaichi, who is Abe&rsquo;s most successful disciple, sees this as unfinished business. She plans major increases in defense spending and has promised to &ldquo;work flat out&rdquo; to build a military strong enough to deter Chinese threats to Japanese islands. She may be tempted to<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/armed-with-supermajority-takaichi-eyes-revising-japan-s-constitution"  target="_blank"> revise Article 9</a> of the Constitution, which bans maintaining a military and going to war. Despite her mandate, however, the bar for revision is exceptionally high, requiring two-thirds support in both chambers and a majority in a public referendum.</p>



<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s hawkish approach to China has boosted her popularity. Last November, she spoke about a possible<a href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/japans-stance-taiwans-security-good-status-quo-and-asian-security"  target="_blank"> Japanese military response</a> in support of Taiwan if China tried to alter the status quo by force. China denounced her and demanded a retraction. Takaichi was only guilty of making explicit what had been implicit. Although rhetorically Beijing overplayed its hand the economic sanctions imposed have been relatively modest. </p>



<p>Tokyo and Beijing will benefit from insulating their trade ties from their diplomatic tiffs. The challenge will be in creating an exit ramp for President Xi Jinping of China to shift course so that normal diplomatic exchanges and channels of communication can be revived. Beijing will need to rethink its diplomacy considering that Takaichi is a leader who is likely to run Japan for a while.</p>



<p>Takaichi, is due in Washington in March for an audience with Trump before his planned summit with Xi Jinping. Trump endorsed Takaichi and had a positive visit to Japan last fall. The reception should be cordial but Tokyo is anxious that Trump might cut a deal with Xi over its head and resurrect the specter of a &ldquo;G-2&rdquo; ( Group of 2) for Washington and Beijing to manage global affairs between themselves.</p>



<p>She is expected to emphasize that Japan remains America&rsquo;s indispensable partner in Asia and point to Tokyo&rsquo;s accelerating defense spending, which aims to hit the threshold of 2% of GDP and boost its military capacity. Even if she faces domestic resistance to higher taxes supporting increased defense expenditures, a more muscular Japan also strengthens Trump&rsquo;s hand going into negotiations with Xi.&nbsp; Given Trump&rsquo;s erratic and impulsive record, there is no certainty whether positioning Japan as the irreplaceable Asian ally will be enough to forestall a grand bargain between Washington and Beijing&mdash;one that could ignore Tokyo&#8217;s interests.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2241133884.jpg" alt="Yasukuni shrine" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Apart from managing the relationship with Washington, Takaichi faces the need to strike a balance between regional sensitivities and domestic political gestures that fire up her conservative and nationalist base. Shortly after her victory, she signaled that she intends to visit<a href="https://time.com/archive/6939556/between-the-shrine-and-a-hard-place/" > the Yasukuni Shrine</a>, a memorial for the war dead in Tokyo, where 14 Class A war criminals, convicted by the post war International Military Tribunal for the Far East, were secretly enshrined in 1978.</p>



<p>The shrine and an adjacent museum have long served as ground zero for an unrepentant view of Japan&rsquo;s wartime conduct: downplaying or omitting Japanese wartime atrocities across Asia, from the forced mobilization of Korean laborers, the exploitation of Korean comfort women, and the Nanjing massacre of 1937 in China.</p>



<p>A Yasukuni visit is red meat for Takaichi&rsquo;s base, which has long championed an exonerating and valorizing stance on Japan&rsquo;s wartime legacy. But such a visit would antagonize China and South Korea, where the shrine is viewed as a symbol of Japanese imperial aggression and historical denialism. It would also imperil the recent thaw in South Korean-Japan ties aimed at strengthening security and economic cooperation.</p>



<p>Her intention is a reminder that unresolved grievances over shared history along with overlapping territorial claims constitute the permafrost of regional relations.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP25260392169351.jpg" alt="EU--Russia-Navalny"/>



<p>Russian opposition leader <a href="https://time.com/6140102/alexei-navalny-russia-profile/" >Alexei Navalny</a>, who died in a remote Siberian prison two years ago, was almost certainly poisoned with a deadly toxin found in South American dart frogs, five European governments said Saturday.</p>



<p>A joint <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-by-the-uk-sweden-france-germany-and-the-netherlands-on-alexei-navalnys-death"  target="_blank">statement</a> from Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands said they were &ldquo;confident&rdquo; Navanly had been poisoned after an analysis of samples taken from his body &ldquo;conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine,&rdquo; and that the Russian government was the likely culprit. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin, and it is not found naturally in Russia. There is no <a href="https://time.com/6696240/alexei-navalny-death-russia-essay/" >innocent explanation</a> for its presence in Navalny&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; the statement said. </p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/6140102/alexei-navalny-russia-profile/" ><em>Navalny Speaks To TIME From His Prison Cell</em></a></p>



<p>&ldquo;Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him,&rdquo; it continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The five countries said they were reporting the case to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, alleging Russia violated the Chemical Weapons Convention. </p>



<p>Russian authorities had previously claimed Navalny, 47, died of natural causes while serving several sentences totaling more than 30 years at a high-security prison above the Arctic Circle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Navalny rose to prominence as an anti-corruption campaigner and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests, becoming a key opponent of President Vladimir Putin. </p>



<p>Navalny&rsquo;s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, appeared at a press conference during the Munich Security Conference alongside European foreign ministers to announce the findings.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Scientists from five European countries have established: my husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with epibatidine&mdash;a neurotoxin, one of the deadliest poisons on earth. In nature, this poison can be found on the skin of the Ecuadorian dart frog. It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death,&rdquo; she said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.&rdquo;</p>



<p>French Foreign Minister Jean-No&euml;l Barrot said the poisoning shows that &ldquo;Vladimir Putin is prepared to use chemical weapons against his own people to remain in power. France pays tribute to this opposition figure, killed for his fight in favor of a free and democratic Russia.&rdquo;</p>



<p>British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper added: &#8220;Only the Russian government had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to use that toxin against Alexei Navalny in prison. We are here today to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin&rsquo;s barbaric attempt to silence Alexei Navalny&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Russia announced Navalny&rsquo;s death on Feb. 16, 2024, just as that year&rsquo;s Munich Security Conference opened. On that day, Navalnaya delivered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kc4ZuyRAbc"  target="_blank">speech</a>, pledging that Putin &ldquo;would pay for what they have done to our country, to my family, and to my husband.&rdquo; After a weeklong dispute over custody, Russia released Navalny&rsquo;s body to his mother.</p>



<p>Last September, Navalnaya said her team had transferred some biological samples from his body abroad, and two laboratories confirmed he had been poisoned. She described a photograph of her husband&rsquo;s prison cell showing vomit on the floor the day he died, and said excerpts from official incident reports submitted by five prison officials indicated he suffered heavy vomiting and convulsions shortly before his death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months after his death, Russia&rsquo;s Investigative Committee declined to open a criminal investigation, citing a combination of medical conditions. Its report listed hypertension, chronic hepatitis, and a damaged vertebra as contributing factors, and claimed a rise in blood pressure disrupted his heart rhythm. One of Navalny&rsquo;s former doctors called the diagnosis &ldquo;implausible.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Navalny had survived a prior assassination attempt in 2020, collapsing on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow after exposure to a nerve agent. He later said he had gathered evidence that Russian security agents had targeted him.</p>



<p>European officials said it remains unclear how the toxin, which is roughly 200 times more potent than morphine, was administered to Navalny.</p>



<p>Navalny&rsquo;s aides said he was close to being released in a prison exchange when he died. Flowers and portraits of the late opposition leader have appeared in memorials across Europe, including outside the former Russian consulate in Frankfurt, highlighting international outrage over his death.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26045326055198.jpg" alt="Germany Munich Security Conference"/>



<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States wants to &ldquo;revitalize&rdquo; its relationship with Europe in a key foreign policy speech to the continent&rsquo;s leaders on Saturday. </p>



<p>Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Rubio said the U.S. and Europe shared a centuries-old history and &ldquo;belong together,&rdquo; a message that some European leaders viewed as an olive branch after an <a href="https://time.com/7275834/trump-and-vance-have-accidentally-united-europe/" >antagonistic appearance by Vice President J.D. Vance</a> at the same forum the previous year. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;We want Europe to be strong,&rdquo; Rubio said, adding that the two world wars of the 20th century serve as a reminder that &ldquo;our destiny is and always will be intertwined with yours.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7275834/trump-and-vance-have-accidentally-united-europe/" ><em>How Europe Has Turned Against U.S.</em></a></p>



<p>His speech comes at a time when <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">U.S.-European relations <a href="https://time.com/7372884/jd-vance-booed-olympics-europe/" >have been strained</a> by President Donald Trump&#8217;s</span> aggressive efforts to annex Greenland, his Administration&rsquo;s ongoing trade war with most European allies, and a years-long divide over the future of NATO and European security.</p>



<p>Rubio argued that the U.S. still cares deeply about Europe&rsquo;s future and suggested disagreements stem from &ldquo;profound concern&rdquo; for the continent, which he described as the birthplace of a common civilization. He said the U.S. intends to work with the Europeans, not against them. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are connected not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually, and we are connected culturally,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what we learned from the speech:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A change in tone</strong></h2>



<p>Rubio&rsquo;s speech marked a dramatic shift in tone from the United States&#8217; contribution to last year&#8217;s conference, delivered by Vice President Vance, who rebuked European leaders for marginalizing far-right parties and accused them of curbing free speech. </p>



<p>While his remarks were met with silence, Rubio&rsquo;s speech drew bursts of applause and laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Secretary of State offered a conciliatory message, saying the U.S., under Trump, seeks to lead a global &ldquo;renewal and restoration.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Rubio said the &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo; that followed the West&rsquo;s Cold War victory gave rise to a &ldquo;dangerous delusion that we had entered &lsquo;the end of history,&rsquo; that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood &#8230; and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We made these mistakes together, and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,&rdquo; Rubio said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Despite the softer tone, Rubio shared much of Vance&#8217;s criticism of Europe over migration.</p>



<p>Rubio warned of the dangers of &#8220;mass migration&#8221; and &ldquo;civilizational erasure,&rdquo; and pointed to what he described as the weakening of post-World War II institutions such as the United Nations, which he said require sweeping reform.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West&lsquo;s managed decline,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>Trump has floated both Rubio and Vance as potential 2028 presidential frontrunners, so their contrasting speeches will likely be dissected by European leaders over the next few years for clues about where the U.S. will be heading if Republicans win.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>U.N. needs reform</strong></h2>



<p>Rubio said the United Nations &ldquo;still has tremendous potential,&rdquo; but argued that on today&rsquo;s most pressing issues, &ldquo;it has no answers and has played virtually no role.&rdquo; Instead, he praised American leadership for &ldquo;problem-solving.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The U.N. could not solve the war in Gaza; it has not solved the war in Ukraine,&rdquo; Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SkyNews/status/2022589705473151163"  target="_blank">said</a>.</p>



<p>His comments come as Trump&rsquo;s Board of Peace, which some view as a potential rival to the U.N., is set to hold its first meeting on Feb. 19, in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>The Board of Peace is designed to oversee Gaza&rsquo;s redevelopment and resolve global conflicts. The inaugural meeting aims to raise funds for Gaza&rsquo;s reconstruction and convene international leaders from the 27 countries that signed the charter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United Arab Emirates and the United States have already pledged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/world/middleeast/board-peace-pledges-gaza.html"  target="_blank">$1 billion</a> to Trump&rsquo;s Board of Peace, according to two officials close to the board&#8217;s funding matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking immediately after Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi struck a contrasting tone.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The main reason for the inadequacy of the current international system is not the United Nations itself, but the fact that some countries magnify differences, pursue national priorities &#8230; and even revive the Cold War mentality,&rdquo; he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/14/g-s1-110107/rubio-speech-munich"  target="_blank">said</a>. &ldquo;All these have undermined the basis of trust, worsened the atmosphere of cooperation, and made the operation of international mechanisms difficult.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Despite Ukraine&rsquo;s fate looming over this year&rsquo;s conference, Rubio made little mention of Russia&rsquo;s full-scale invasion, citing it only as an example of the United Nations&rsquo; shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It has not solved the war in Ukraine. It took American leadership and partnership with many of the countries here today just to bring the two sides to the table in search of a still elusive peace,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The war remains a major concern for Europe as the Trump administration increases pressure on Ukraine to make concessions for a peace deal with Russia. Ukrainian officials recently said American negotiators had called for Ukraine to hold elections by May 15, a deadline seen as unlikely while the war continues.</p>



<p>Speaking later at the conference, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said his country would hold elections only after a cease-fire. Zelensky, who has been president since 2019, noted that elections have not been held since Russia&rsquo;s full-scale invasion in 2022 and stressed that Ukraine needed strong security guarantees before agreeing to any end to the war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We hope President Trump hears us,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>European reaction</strong></h2>



<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was &#8220;very much reassured by the speech of the secretary of state,&rdquo; calling him a &ldquo;good friend&rdquo; and a &ldquo;strong ally.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Upon taking the stage after Rubio&rsquo;s speech, she started with a simple <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2026/02/14/munich-security-conference-rubio-to-give-speech-as-leaders-gather"  target="_blank">message</a>: &#8220;Europe must become more independent &ndash; there is no other choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The European way of life &ndash; our democratic foundation and the trust of our citizens &ndash; is being challenged in new ways. On everything from territories to tariffs or tech regulations,&#8221; she said, appearing to reference the U.S., but also citing Russia&#8217;s ongoing aggression against Ukraine.</p>



<p>This independence must be wide-ranging and cover areas including &#8220;Defence and energy. Economy and trade. Raw materials and digital tech,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some may say the word &lsquo;independence&rsquo; runs counter to our transatlantic bond. But the opposite is true. An independent Europe is a strong Europe. And a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance,&#8221; she also said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We know some in the administration have a harsher tone on these topics,&rdquo; she conceded, without naming Trump or Vance.</p>



<p>But not all Europeans were impressed by the softer approach.</p>



<p>&ldquo;In substance, nothing changes, Europe now has to become more independent and assume more responsibility, also in the security and defense area,&rdquo; Austria&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marco-rubio-msc-europe-we-belong-together/"  target="_blank">told</a> POLITICO.</p>



<p>Similarly, although Democratic politicians in Munich acknowledged that Rubio&rsquo;s speech signaled a change in tone, they questioned whether it would alter the substance of the transatlantic relationship.</p>



<p>&ldquo;He was clearly trying to escape the vituperative ghost of J.D. Vance in seeking to be calming and reassuring, but it was so lacking in substance and specificity that in the end, its impact will be very limited,&rdquo; Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said.</p>



<p>He added, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think the speech was about turning the page [after Greenland], but just getting over the moment, yeah, has given no signs that he&#8217;s backing down from the antagonism and hostility.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sen. Thom Tillis, the top Republican on the Senate NATO Observer Group, praised Rubio&rsquo;s speech, saying it reinforced efforts to reassure allied leaders that NATO will endure.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I thought it was great,&rdquo; Tillis said. &ldquo;We all know that that speech would not have been delivered if the White House hadn&#8217;t agreed with it. Yeah. So I think that&#8217;s not only a message from Marco, but it&#8217;s a message from the president.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A dose of reality&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Despite Rubio&rsquo;s conciliatory message, his speech came a day after he skipped the &ldquo;Berlin Format&rdquo; meeting with European leaders on the war in Ukraine, a key point of contention between Europe and the Trump Administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, Trump continues to pressure Zelensky of Ukraine to accept a deal that could involve ceding significant portions of the country to Russia. Both European governments and Ukrainian officials have rejected such a proposal, arguing that it would not resolve the conflict but merely pause it, leaving the region&rsquo;s future uncertain.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,&rdquo; Zelensky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/09/world/europe/zelensky-trump-ukraine-russia.html"  target="_blank">said</a> in a video address from Kyiv in December. He added that any decisions made without Ukraine &ldquo;are at the same time decisions against peace&rdquo; and called such measures &ldquo;dead decisions; they will never work.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Praise for NATO</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>At the conference, Rubio praised NATO, citing instances when U.S. and NATO troops fought and died alongside one another.    </p>



<p>&#8220;We have fought against each other, then reconciled, then fought and reconciled again. And we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And I&#8217;m here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity, and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rubio&rsquo;s comments stood in contrast to recent comments made by Trump about America&rsquo;s NATO allies. Since the turn of the year, Trump has repeatedly questioned NATO&rsquo;s willingness to support the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,&rdquo; he blasted on Truth Social on Jan. 7. &ldquo;We will always be there for NATO, even if they won&rsquo;t be there for us.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In an interview with Fox in Davos, the President also asserted that while NATO allies sent troops to Afghanistan, they &#8220;stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>German Chancellor <a href="https://time.com/collections/100-most-influential-people-2025/7273789/friedrich-merz/" >Friedrich Merz</a> has warned of &ldquo;a deep rift&rdquo; between Europe and the United States, arguing that the latter &ldquo;will not be powerful enough to go it alone.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In his address at the Munich Security Conference Friday, Merz urged Europe and the U.S. to &ldquo;repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together&rdquo; in what he referred to as an &ldquo;era of great power rivalry.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Switching to English as he addressed American &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; Merz nodded to Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7346819/can-trump-pull-united-states-out-of-nato-legal-experts/" >contentious relationship with NATO,</a> insisting that &ldquo;being a part of [the alliance] is not only Europe&rsquo;s competitive advantage. It&rsquo;s also the United States&rsquo; competitive advantage.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While he acknowledged that the existing global order has long been flawed, Merz&mdash;when discussing the &ldquo;under destruction&rdquo; theme of this year&rsquo;s conference&mdash;argued the &ldquo;international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He also referenced Vice President J.D. Vance&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOsgfINdKg"  target="_blank">speech</a> from last year&rsquo;s conference. Vance drew ire from European leaders when he argued that what concerned him most was Europe&rsquo;s &ldquo;threat from within&#8230; the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values&mdash;values shared with the United States of America.&rdquo; He used &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; as an example of the values in retreat.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours,&rdquo; Merz continued. &ldquo;Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The German leader appeared to make further strides to distinguish Europe from the Trump Administration, adding: &ldquo;We stick to climate agreements and the World Health Organization (WHO) because we are convinced that global challenges can only be solved together.&rdquo;</p>



<p>On Jan. 22, the U.S., under Trump&rsquo;s direction, officially pulled out of the WHO. The move has garnered much <a href="https://time.com/7357180/us-withdrawal-who-world-health-organization/" >criticism</a> from global health experts.</p>



<p>In response to Merz&#8217;s remarks, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told TIME: &ldquo;Friends tell friends hard truths, and the President has also been clear to our European friends that they must follow his lead by ending unfettered migration, reversing <a href="https://time.com/7319744/trump-un-speech-climate-change/" >&lsquo;Green New Scam&rsquo; policies,</a> and moving away from leftist ideology, or risk their own destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Europe takes part in ongoing negotiations regarding the hope for a cease-fire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Merz said he has also started private talks with French President Emmanuel Macron about &ldquo;nuclear deterrence.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Merz_Munich.jpg" alt="62nd Munich Security Conference" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Merz&rsquo;s concerns echo those made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Davos in January. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Carney argued that the old world order was &ldquo;not coming back&rdquo; and encouraged people not to &ldquo;mourn&rdquo; the way things used to be. He accused &ldquo;great powers&rdquo; of using economic pressure to yield results while urging middle powers to push back.</p>



<p>Carney&rsquo;s remarks were delivered shortly after <a href="https://time.com/7357333/carney-trump-row-united-states-canada-relationship/" >Trump threatened to tariff countries</a> who oppose his campaign to <a href="https://time.com/7368798/trump-greenland-pursuit/" >annex Greenland</a>&mdash;a threat he has since walked back. Trump later <a href="https://time.com/7357333/carney-trump-row-united-states-canada-relationship/" >lashed out in response</a> to Carney&rsquo;s speech.</p>

<p>The U.S. President will not be appearing at the Munich Security Conference. Instead, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will represent the U.S. on Saturday and deliver a highly-anticipated speech.</p>



<p>Rubio also warned of a &ldquo;new era&rdquo; in geopolitics as he boarded his flight to Germany.</p>



<p>When asked if his message to Europeans will take a softer approach than Vance&rsquo;s address last year, Rubio told reporters: &ldquo;The world is changing very fast right in front of us. We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it&#8217;s going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be.&rdquo;</p>



<p>On Friday afternoon, the U.S. Department of State <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/2026/02/public-schedule-february-13-2026/"  target="_blank">confirmed</a> that Rubio and Merz had met in Munich, after the German Chancellor&rsquo;s speech.</p>



<p>&ldquo;They discussed pressing global challenges including securing supply chains, advancing efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, and strengthening the partnership between the United States and Europe,&rdquo; said a spokesperson. &ldquo;The Secretary expressed appreciation for Germany&rsquo;s strong support for Ukraine, including over $76 billion in assistance since 2022, and discussed continued coordination on reconstruction efforts.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260893106.jpg" alt="UK High Court Rules Government Ban Of Palestine Action Unlawful"/>



<p>The British government&rsquo;s designation of Palestine Action as a terror group has been deemed unlawful by London&rsquo;s High Court.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/R-Ammori-v-SSHD-OPEN-Judgment-final.pdf"  target="_blank">In a ruling</a> issued on Friday, three senior judges said the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/three-groups-to-be-proscribed"  target="_blank">decision</a> implemented last July was  &ldquo;disproportionate&rdquo; and breached free speech rights.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>&ldquo;At its core, Palestine Action is an organization that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality. A very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action within the definition at section <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/1"  target="_blank">1(1) of the 2000 Act</a>,&rdquo; the ruling stated. &ldquo;We propose to make an order quashing the Home Secretary&rsquo;s decision to proscribe Palestine Action.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The High Court determined that former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (who now serves as Foreign Secretary) had not properly followed her own policies when deciding what constitutes an organization being proscribed under the Terrorism Act. </p>



<p>The government has vowed to appeal the decision.</p>



<p>For now, Palestine Action will remain a proscribed terror group until a consequential hearing takes place on Feb. 20. Any appeals will have to be laid out in that hearing and it will be determined what happens next.</p>



<p>As such, the High Court judges stressed that due to the proscription remaining in place, it is still an offence to support, fund, or belong to Palestine Action.</p>



<p>Despite that, demonstrators gathered outside of the court on Friday in support of the group, holding placards that read &ldquo;we won&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a terrorist.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Huda Ammori, the co-founder of Palestine Action who brought the appeal over the designation to the High Court, also celebrated the decision. &ldquo;We won. The High Court ruled the Palestine Action ban is unlawful as it is disproportionate to free speech,&rdquo; she <a href="https://x.com/HudaAmmori/status/2022251656256106746"  target="_blank">said</a>.</p>



<p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood intends to fight the ruling in the Court of Appeals. </p>



<p>&ldquo;Supporting the Palestinian cause is not the same as supporting Palestine Action,&rdquo; <a href="https://x.com/ShabanaMahmood/status/2022261449909817591"  target="_blank">said Mahmood</a>.  &ldquo;The court has acknowledged that Palestine Action has carried out acts of terrorism&hellip; and that its actions are not consistent with democratic values and the rule of law.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am disappointed by the Court&rsquo;s decision and disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organization is disproportionate,&rdquo; she argued.</p>



<p>Prior to its designation as a terror group, Palestine Action was linked to a break-in at the Royal Air Force&#8217;s <a href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/our-organisation/stations/raf-brize-norton/"  target="_blank">Brize Norton</a> air base in Oxfordshire, England, in June last year. Two planes were damaged during the incident.</p>



<p>Former Home Secretary Cooper cited the break-in when explaining her decision to add Palestine Action to the list of proscribed organizations.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The disgraceful attack on Brize Norton in the early hours of the morning on Friday 20 June is the latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal damage committed by Palestine Action,&rdquo; she told the House of Commons. &ldquo;The U.K.&rsquo;s defence enterprise is vital to the nation&rsquo;s national security and this Government will not tolerate those that put that security at risk. Counter Terrorism Policing are leading the criminal investigation into this attack.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Last month, five alleged Palestine Action protesters pleaded not guilty to offences relating to the air base break-in.</p>



<hr/>



<p>The government&rsquo;s designation of Palestine Action as a terror group last year drew significant criticism from high-profile organizations such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/knowledge-hub/all-resources/open-letter-members-house-commons-and-peers-house-lords-regarding-palestine-action/"  target="_blank">Amnesty International</a>, the U.K.-based <a href="https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/statement/palestine-action-is-not-a-terrorist-organisation/"  target="_blank">Jewish Voice for Labour,</a> and others.</p>



<p>United Nations Human Rights Chief <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/07/uk-palestine-action-ban-disturbing-misuse-uk-counter-terrorism-legislation"  target="_blank">Volker T&uuml;rk</a> referred to the decision as &ldquo;disproportionate and unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In August, hundreds of protesters were arrested by police as they gathered outside the British Parliament, holding placards in support of Palestine Action.</p>

<p>We are living through a moment of profound strain on the global system. Geopolitical conflict, economic uncertainty, technological acceleration, political polarization and social fragmentation are no longer separate challenges. They are converging, reinforcing one another, and reshaping how leadership is exercised and where it comes from.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Coming out of the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s annual meeting in Davos and heading into another consequential gathering at the Munich Security Conference, which starts today, one thing is clear: these convenings are becoming more consequential, not less. Not because they offer easy answers, but because they provide something increasingly rare and increasingly necessary: opportunities for sustained, face-to-face dialogue among leaders grappling with the hardest problems of our time.</p>



<p>This is not nostalgia for globalization. It is not a defense of elite gatherings for their own sake. It is about necessity.</p>



<p>The world is fragmenting. Alliances are being reassessed. Trust in institutions is eroding. Political divides within countries are deepening, even among long-standing allies. At the same time, technology&mdash;particularly artificial intelligence&mdash;is advancing faster than governance systems can keep pace. These forces are colliding, and the consequences are playing out in markets, workplaces, and societies around the world.</p>



<p>In this environment, dialogue is not a soft concept. It is foundational infrastructure.</p>



<p>Critics often dismiss forums like Davos as talk shops and view Munich as a grim exercise in security realism. That critique misses what is actually happening. These gatherings matter not because of what is said onstage but because of what happens away from the cameras&mdash;where leaders can argue, disagree, test assumptions and confront uncomfortable truths without the distortion of performative politics or social media outrage.</p>



<p>These conversations cannot happen over Zoom. They cannot be delegated to artificial intelligence. They require presence, nuance, trust and judgment. At a time when many public institutions are constrained by polarization or retreating from global engagement, these convenings serve an increasingly important function.</p>



<p>One of the most significant shifts underway is this: leadership is no longer coming primarily from the public sector. That is not an ideological observation. It is a practical one. </p>



<p>Governments are under strain, and many political leaders are increasingly focused inward. Yet the defining challenges of our era do not respect borders. Cyber threats, artificial intelligence, trade disruption, workforce transitions, energy security, climate pressures, human rights, labor standards and national security are inherently transnational.</p>



<p>As a result, responsibility is shifting. Leadership is emerging, increasingly, from the private sector and civil society: institutions that live with complexity every day. Companies operate across borders. They manage diverse workforces, serve multiple constituencies and navigate competing regulatory, cultural and political expectations simultaneously.</p>



<p>In many ways, they already inhabit a borderless world, even as tariffs rise and alliances fray.</p>



<p>This reality is reshaping what is expected of chief executives and board chairs. They are no longer seen solely as operators or stewards of capital. They are increasingly expected to act as statesmen and stateswomen, making decisions that resonate globally, nationally and locally at the same time.</p>



<p>Chief executives are being asked to engage with defining issues that do not fit neatly into quarterly earnings calls: technological governance and cyber risk; artificial intelligence and its impact on work and society; employment transitions; trade and supply chain resilience; human rights and labor standards; energy security; national and economic stability. These issues shape institutional legitimacy and market confidence.</p>



<p>Dialogue alone is not sufficient. But without dialogue, nothing durable is possible.</p>



<p>The ability to sit face to face, to listen as much as to argue, to disagree without retreating into caricature is a prerequisite for meaningful action. Gatherings like Davos and Munich preserve that capacity at a moment when it is eroding elsewhere. They create space for trust to form, for partnerships to emerge, and for leaders to recalibrate as conditions shift.</p>



<p>If political systems are constrained in addressing global challenges that cross borders, the responsibility shifts. Chief executives, chairs and leaders of civil society will increasingly be asked to step forward: not because they sought the role, but because the moment demands it.</p>



<p>That leadership will not come from slogans. It will come from judgment, courage, and engagement. It will be shaped, in no small part, by the quality of the conversations leaders are willing to have with one another.</p>



<p>The question is no longer whether gatherings like Davos or Munich matter. The question is whether leaders are willing to use them not as stages, but as workshops for ideas, as places to wrestle honestly with the hardest questions and decisions of our time.</p>



<p>The challenges we face do not stop at borders. Leadership, if it is to mean anything now, cannot either.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Social media users are “becoming Chinese” just in time for the Lunar New Year. But what’s behind the trend, and will it last?]]></description>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/becoming-chinese.jpg" alt="Close-up shot of female hand holding a smartphone, photographing Chinese lantern hanging on the street during Chinese New Year. "/>



<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, Sherry Zhu, a 23-year-old Chinese American living in New Jersey, has begun sharing Chinese cultural practices to an unusual audience.</p>



<p>&ldquo;First Chinese New Year kinda nervous,&rdquo; one person commented. Another proclaimed that &ldquo;as a newly Chinese baddie,&rdquo; February was no longer about Valentine&rsquo;s Day, but about the Lunar New Year, which begins on Feb. 17 and is the biggest annual multi-day period of festivities celebrated in China and other countries in Asia as well as by Chinese diasporic communities around the world.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>It&rsquo;s also&mdash;as of a new trend&mdash;going to be celebrated by a new cohort of self-identifying &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; non-Chinese social media users, primarily from the U.S., who have embraced the moment as their &ldquo;Chinese era&rdquo; or are &ldquo;Chinamaxxing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Observers tell TIME that the trend reflects a growing fascination with China as the country <a href="https://time.com/7301187/china-visa-free-travel-countries-tourism-us-trump-isolation-economy/" >opens up</a> and rises in soft power. For Americans that are disillusioned by a state of affairs marked by <a href="https://time.com/7344924/federal-officers-shooting-immigration-portland-minneapolis-prosecution-immunity/" >aggressive immigration crackdowns</a>, <a href="https://time.com/7377620/doj-grand-jury-slotkin-goodlander-kelly-indictment-illegal-orders-trump/" >fractured domestic politics</a>, and <a href="https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/" >controversial foreign policy</a>, observers say it also reflects a desire for an alternative model to the U.S.</p>



<p>&ldquo;China feels much more present in everyday American life than it did even a decade ago,&rdquo; says Caroline Ouellette, a researcher at University of California, Los Angeles. &ldquo;China looks different in the American imagination than it did in previous generations,&rdquo; in large part, she adds, because social media has made information about and from China more accessible. &ldquo;Online, you see sleek public transit, walkable cities, aunties dancing in parks, bustling night markets&mdash;everyday scenes that complicate older stereotypes.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Chinese government has also <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/china-global-us-influencers-soft-power-5191976"  target="_blank">made a concerted effort</a> to disseminate <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/10/2025/how-china-wins-in-new-propaganda-war"  target="_blank">more positive portrayals</a> of China over social media. And China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry <a href="https://english.news.cn/20260206/81ba858f9df7424191742b6618607a8e/c.html"  target="_blank">endorsed</a> the &ldquo;becoming Chinese&rdquo; trend, with spokesperson Lin Jian noting that flights to China for the festive Chinese New Year period have dramatically increased this year.</p>



<p>Participants in the trend are &ldquo;engaging with a hyperreal China, a symbolic version that absorbs everything Americans fear that they&rsquo;re losing: community, structure, competence, limits, cultural continuity and care for elders,&rdquo; Ouellette said in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTf-F6mkrvO/"  target="_blank">video</a> for anthropology channel AnthroDorphins. By contrast, today&rsquo;s China &ldquo;feels contemporary, dynamic, even aspirational in certain ways,&rdquo; she adds to TIME.</p>



<p>Memes related to the trend have been circulating for nearly a year, but they&rsquo;ve grown in intensity in recent months.</p>



<p>Zhu has gone viral since December for her TikTok videos in which she teaches presumably non-Chinese, often non-Asian viewers how to embody their &ldquo;Chinese baddie&rdquo; selves using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-based practices, like boiling apples to produce a digestion-aiding tea and wearing house slippers to avoid placing your bare feet on a cold floor. But Zhu&rsquo;s viewers aren&rsquo;t just adopting Chinese lifestyle habits, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;turning Chinese,&rdquo; she <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sherryxiiruii/video/7591887909058350391?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-93CLxN2fePl"  target="_blank">declared</a> in a clip at the start of January.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re a Chinese baddie, how are you celebrating Chinese New Year?&rdquo; Zhu asked in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sherryxiiruii/video/7602366890769517838?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-93sZSRJJhRQ"  target="_blank">video</a> earlier this month, anticipating the upcoming holiday. Wear red for luck, avoid cutting your hair for a month after the first day of the Chinese New Year, and exchange red packets filled with money with family, she has advised. In her comments, one person shared the red manicure design they planned to get for the occasion, while another posted photos of red paper lanterns and banner decorations they put up around their home. &ldquo;Cousin Sherry,&rdquo; some have asked, adopting a familial tone with Zhu, &ldquo;what are we doing for Chinese New Year?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Other non-Chinese users have made videos showing themselves <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lornajanex/video/7594863025497050390?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-93sZFgIdoDo"  target="_blank">wearing red for good luck</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vaehh.vibbes/video/7602442913808764190?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-93sZMzrhUwi"  target="_blank">marking Feb. 17 on their calendars</a>, and discussing their Chinese zodiac forecasts for the &ldquo;Year of the Horse.&rdquo; Meanwhile, both <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lulutheherbalist/video/7597997842292034847?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-93sZDHJEsie"  target="_blank">Chinese Americans</a> on TikTok and <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/697770fd000000000d00b051?xsec_token=ABBmJiC1-llEsFIsn6q2lGcilJXqlnXRRn6UCCh3G2A0Y=&amp;xsec_source="  target="_blank">Chinese users</a> on RedNote have shared more tips on what to do and not to do over the Chinese New Year.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Found out I was Chinese a few days ago,&rdquo; one TikTok user captioned a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@detriana_/video/7594993091589770510?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-93sZQOZyq3j"  target="_blank">Jan. 14 video</a>, &ldquo;so OUR new year is coming up.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&lsquo;There&rsquo;s pride, but there&rsquo;s also memory&rsquo;</h2>



<p>Zhu often gets comments asking if wearing house slippers or eating hot pot can make someone Chinese, to which she enthusiastically replies in the affirmative. But not everyone is as supportive of the trend.</p>



<p>Vanessa Li, a 26-year-old Chinese Australian content creator who has <a href="https://vnessali.substack.com/p/im-in-a-chinese-time-in-my-life-and?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2"  target="_blank">written</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vnessali/video/7595122205558689042"  target="_blank">spoken</a> about the &ldquo;becoming Chinese&rdquo; memes, says criticism of the trend tends to stem from a fear that Chinese culture is being appropriated and treated as little more than an internet fad.</p>



<p>Li says the meme has coincided with other aspects of Chinese culture going viral but being decontextualized from their Chinese origin or history, like the <a href="https://fashionmagazine.com/style/adidas-tang-jacket-mandarin-collar-trend/"  target="_blank">Tang jacket</a> which has been refashioned by Adidas.</p>



<p>But many like Zhu are happy for Chinese identity to be held up as an ideal among Americans, when it often hasn&rsquo;t been. They just hope it lasts.</p>



<p>Ouellette tells TIME that growing up in the Midwest as a half-Chinese person, she was no stranger to being told her lunch smelled strange or that her eyes looked weird. And in mainstream entertainment, aspects of Chinese culture or identity were often turned into the butt of the joke.</p>



<p>&ldquo;When there&rsquo;s a sudden 180-degree shift and the same cultural markers become trendy, it can feel jarring,&rdquo; Ouellette says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s pride, but there&rsquo;s also memory.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The recent history of <a href="https://time.com/5858649/racism-coronavirus/" >anti-Asian racism</a>, <a href="https://time.com/5797836/coronavirus-racism-stereotypes-attacks/" >sinophobia</a>, and <a href="https://time.com/5947723/atlanta-shootings-anti-asian-violence-america/" >violence</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic remains at the top of many Asian Americans&rsquo; minds, says Kathy Pham, a 23-year-old Vietnamese American artist from Colorado.</p>



<p>Pham <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kalinaxkathy/video/7601991191147580727"  target="_blank">sees the meme</a> as a form of &ldquo;eating the other,&rdquo; a reference to an <a href="https://sites.evergreen.edu/comalt/wp-content/uploads/sites/253/2016/11/eating-the-other.pdf"  target="_blank">essay</a> by feminist author bell hooks on how dominant groups &ldquo;consume&rdquo; marginalized cultures, reinforcing existing power structures. Especially against the backdrop of <a href="https://time.com/7316315/republicans-far-right-reacts-charlie-kirk-death-blame-left-crackdown/" >deepening political polarization</a> in the U.S., Americans may be participating in the trend in order to distance themselves from a politic that they disagree with, Pham tells TIME.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The over-riding fear is that cultural, ethnic, and racial differences will be continually commodified and offered up as new dishes to enhance the white palate&mdash;that the Other will be eaten, consumed, and forgotten,&rdquo; hooks writes in the essay.</p>



<p>Pointing out that many of the aspects of Chinese culture that have been popularized have been bite-sized, easily digestible pieces like&mdash;if not literally food&mdash;wellness habits or fashion items, Li says she tries to instead emphasize the deeper, at times less glamorous parts of the Chinese experience, like observing filial piety.</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s &ldquo;thousands of years of history that led the culture to what it is today&rdquo; that risks being commodified or reduced to a passing trend, Li says.</p>



<p>The trend is ultimately rooted in humor: from Zhu&rsquo;s obviously hyperbolic declarations that her viewers have turned Chinese overnight to the underlying dissonance of non-Chinese Americans eagerly calling themselves Chinese even as the U.S. and China remain locked as geopolitical rivals.</p>



<p>&ldquo;For some people, especially those who consume a steady stream of geopolitical messaging, China is primarily understood through competition&mdash;trade, tech, national security,&rdquo; says Ouellette. But, she adds, &ldquo;it almost feels like the humor works because of the tension&mdash;like they&rsquo;re aware of the rivalry and playing with it rather than taking it at face value.&rdquo;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of irony, Ouellette says, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s also genuine curiosity and appreciation.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;For some people, it&rsquo;s not just aesthetic imitation; it&rsquo;s an attempt to engage with something that feels new or different from what they grew up with,&rdquo; she adds.</p>



<p>Zhu observed that shift among her viewers. She tells TIME that what started as a lighthearted joke and a way to share a culture she is proud of has turned into people following her tips on a daily basis and asking her questions to make sure they&rsquo;re correctly understanding the practices.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The videos that I create don&rsquo;t necessarily erase a lot of the past hurt that a lot of Asian Americans and Chinese Americans have faced before, but I think that it leads to more visible conversations,&rdquo; Zhu says. &ldquo;I think for future generations it will create a more welcoming and accepting society.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&lsquo;A credible alternative&rsquo;</h2>



<p>While drinking hot water in the morning and keeping your neck warm may be the most visible parts of the trend, the desire to embody a kind of Chineseness has been brewing on the internet over the past year.</p>



<p>&ldquo;You met me at a very chinese time in my life,&rdquo; one person <a href="https://x.com/girl__virus/status/1908355965218628047"  target="_blank">posted</a> on X in April, a spin on a line from the 1999 film <em>Fight Club</em>. It spawned a number of other posts with the same phrase as well as the &ldquo;Chinese era&rdquo; shorthand.</p>



<p>In some posts, often in response to the latest Chinese technological advancement or controversial U.S. political news, social media users have framed their embrace of this &ldquo;Chinese era&rdquo; in opposition to an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLsm9IwSNRA/"  target="_blank">American &ldquo;century of humiliation</a>,&rdquo; a term that borrows the name often used to describe the decline of the Qing Dynasty and applies it to the present U.S., which is suffering from a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/usa-popularity-collapse-worldwide-trump-return/"  target="_blank">dramatic fall in global perception</a> since Donald Trump returned to the presidency last year.</p>

Meanwhile, <a href="https://time.com/7271656/popmart-china-blindbox-labubu-designer-toys-genz-luxury-industry-revenue/" >Chinese brands</a> like <a href="https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2025/7289592/pop-mart/" >Pop Mart</a>, <a href="https://time.com/7336909/eating-alone-solo-dining-bans-loneliness-restaurants-adapt-single-economy/" >Haidilao</a> and <a href="https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2025/7289633/mixue-group/" >Mixue</a> and apps like <a href="https://time.com/7207351/tiktok-refugees-us-red-note/" >RedNote</a>, <a href="https://time.com/7210296/chinese-ai-company-deepseek-stuns-american-ai-industry/" >DeepSeek</a>, and even a social check-in platform <a href="https://time.com/7353845/china-are-you-dead-yet-app-si-le-ma-self-love-generation-individualism/" >&lsquo;Are you dead yet?&rsquo;</a> have gained a foothold in overseas markets.</p>



<p>RedNote, in particular, has been a <a href="https://time.com/7225725/cultural-exchange-between-the-u-s-and-china/" >point of cultural exchange</a> between Chinese and Americans. The <a href="https://time.com/7208185/how-tiktoks-most-followed-us-influencers-reacted-to-the-app-going-dark-amid-ban/" >initial ban of TikTok</a> in the U.S. last January <a href="https://time.com/7206781/red-note-tiktok-migration/" >led to an exodus of Americans to RedNote</a>, some of whom have continued using the Chinese app even after TikTok was restored to U.S. app stores.</p>



<p>The ban &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t kill American interest in Chinese content; it just redirected it straight to the source,&rdquo; says Ashley Dudarenok, who runs a consumer research consultancy in mainland China and Hong Kong. &ldquo;For the first time, they had a direct, unfiltered window into the daily lives of Chinese people, bypassing Western media narratives.&rdquo;</p>



<p>As the trend of &ldquo;becoming Chinese&rdquo; picked up, Chinese users have dubbed foreign participants &ldquo;cloud relatives&rdquo; and eagerly shared tips about Chinese cooking and wellness, Dudarenok says.</p>



<p>&ldquo;For decades, the interaction was about China explaining itself to the West,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;Now, they feel the West is coming to them, and the majority are responding with a generous and open attitude.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Still, Dudarenok says it&rsquo;s not that people are suddenly embracing Communist theory or wanting the U.S. to follow a unitary political system. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re embracing hot water, herbal soups, and efficient public transit,&rdquo; she says, and engaging with the &ldquo;hyperreal China&rdquo; Ouellette described.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s less about a sudden love for China,&rdquo; says Dudarenok, &ldquo;and more about a search for a credible alternative to a system they feel is not delivering for them.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bangladesh-Tarique-Rahman-04.jpg" alt=""/>



<p>Tarique Rahman had spent 17 years in exile before returning to Bangladesh on Christmas Day. Just seven weeks later, he looks set to become the South Asian nation&rsquo;s new Prime Minister.</p>



<p>Polling indicates that Rahman&rsquo;s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is set to win an outright majority of around 185 seats in the 300-member legislature in Thursday&rsquo;s general election, which is the first since the <a href="https://time.com/7007790/bangladesh-prime-minister-sheikh-hasina-resigns-military-mass-protests-explainer/" >ouster</a> of autocratic former Prime Minister <a href="https://time.com/6330463/bangladesh-sheikh-hasina-wazed-profile/" >Sheikh Hasina</a> on Aug. 5, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>TIME sat down with Rahman in early January as he laid out his plans for rebooting South Asia&rsquo;s second biggest economy and healing social divisions. Asked what his first priorities would be, Rahman replied: &ldquo;ensuring rule of law. The second one is to bring back financial discipline. The third will be to try to unify the country. Whatever political programs we have, whatever policies we take, if we cannot unify the country, it won&rsquo;t be possible to take the country forward.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Here are five takeaways from TIME&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7358216/bangladesh-elections-tarique-rahman-profile/" >exclusive interview</a> with Bangladesh&rsquo;s new leader.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healing the nation</strong></h2>



<p>Up to 1,400 people were killed in the <a href="https://time.com/7003130/bangladesh-student-protests-police-job-quota-hasina-awami-league-razakars/" >July 2024 revolution</a> that toppled Hasina in addition to some 3,500 extrajudicially disappeared during the last 15 years of her despotic reign. Those wounds remain very raw, and Rahman will have to rebuild trust in institutions that were totally politicized by Hasina&rsquo;s Awami League party, including the military, courts, civil service, and security services.</p>



<p>Violence targeting the Awami League and religious minorities broke out swiftly after the BNP-led coalition last took power in 2001, and Rahman&mdash;who has preached a message of unity and forsworn retribution since returning to the nation of 175 million&mdash;will have to work tirelessly to keep the peace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Vengeance will not bring [anything] back,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Rather, if we can control it, if we can keep everyone united, keep the country united, that might get us something good.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fixing the economy</strong></h2>



<p>Bangladesh was the Asia-Pacific&rsquo;s fastest growing economy during Hasina&rsquo;s last stint in power, with GDP rising from $71 billion in 2006 to $460 billion in 2022. But soaring costs, inequality, and youth unemployment saw resentment grow against her Awami League, which was banned from taking part in Thursday&rsquo;s election.</p>



<p>Bangladesh&rsquo;s woes have not improved much since Hasina&rsquo;s ouster, with high inflation and a weak taka currency combining to erode real incomes for ordinary households. Some 2 million young Bangladeshis enter the workforce each year, though youth unemployment already stands at 13.5%. Declining foreign reserves have led to import restrictions that undermine energy supplies and the vital manufacturing industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With over 40 million Bangladeshis living in extreme poverty, one of the BNP&rsquo;s flagship policies was monthly cash to women and the unemployed via a &ldquo;Family Card,&rdquo; although questions remain about how it will be funded.</p>



<p>Rahman also wants to boost connectivity to unleash the potential of young entrepreneurs to embrace the digital economy, while liberalizing the banking sector to allow them better access to international markets. In addition, he wants to upskill the roughly 1 million Bangladeshi migrant workers currently toiling overseas to allow them to seek better-paid jobs. &ldquo;We can train them with languages and the other things they need to know,&rdquo; he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resetting relations with India and the U.S.</strong></h2>



<p>Bangladesh&rsquo;s reliance on exports means improving relations with both regional superpower India and the top purchaser of Bangladeshi goods, the U.S., will take precedence. Ties with New Delhi soured following the toppling of Hasina, who was very close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a sign of how bitter relations have sunk, in January star Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman had his Indian Premier League contract abruptly canceled, prompting Dhaka to ban broadcasts of the league in retaliation.</p>



<p>Still, there are indications that India is pragmatically prepared to work with the BNP, with Rahman meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in late December. However, many points of contention remain, including over Teesta River, with the BNP campaigning on signing the 1997 U.N. Water Convention to &ldquo;claim a fair share of water.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Rahman says many of the treaties between India and Bangladesh under Hasina contain &ldquo;imbalances&rdquo; that must be rectified to properly reset bilateral relations. &ldquo;Of course, we are neighbors,&rdquo; says Rahman. &ldquo;Bangladesh&rsquo;s interest, guarding the interest of our people, comes first, then we will try to take relations further.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Trump Administration, meanwhile, has also been critical of the interim government, whose leader, Nobel laureate <a href="https://time.com/collections/100-most-influential-people-2025/7273785/muhammad-yunus/" >Muhammad Yunus</a>, is known to be a close friend of Hillary Clinton. While Trump initially imposed &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs of 37% on Bangladesh, Dhaka managed to negotiate that down to 20%, and earlier this week down again to 19% in exchange for Bangladesh opening its markets to a wider range of American goods. In addition, certain clothing and textile goods produced with American cotton and man-made textiles can enter the U.S. tariff-free.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s progress ,but Rahman has eyes on reducing the nation&rsquo;s trade deficit to negotiate a further tariff reprieve&mdash;potentially by purchasing Boeing airplanes and U.S. energy infrastructure. &ldquo;We can help each other,&rdquo; Rahman said of Trump.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Managing rising Islamism</strong></h2>



<p>Other than the BNP, the other main beneficiary of Thursday&rsquo;s election is the Bangladesh&rsquo;s main Islamist party, Jamaat e-Islami, which has had its Hasina-era ban rescinded and looks on course to win the second most seats.</p>



<p>While Jamaat has the goal of Shari&lsquo;a law in its party constitution, it moderated its more radical rhetoric, focusing on social welfare and rebranding itself as &ldquo;anti-fascist.&rdquo; However, critics say a leopard can&rsquo;t change its spots and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/11/bangladesh-election-islamist-party-women-freedoms"  target="_blank">misogynic comments</a> from the party&rsquo;s leader, Shafiqur Rahman, including denying the existence of marital rape, has made rights activists very nervous.</p>



<p>The fact that the BNP&mdash;which previously had an electoral alliance with Jamaat&mdash;appears to have won an outright majority means the Islamists&rsquo; clout will be restricted. But Jamaat will remain a significant force in the country going forward, and Rahman says it&rsquo;s incumbent on all parties to work together toward a common good.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only responsible of the BNP, but all the political parties in the country who believe in democracy, who believe in the voting rights of the people,&rdquo; says Rahman. &ldquo;We need to work together and unite so that we do not go back to before Aug. 5. We must go forward so that people can have the political rights.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What of the students?</strong></h2>



<p>The revolution that toppled Hasina began with student-led protests against employment quotas for regime loyalists, though soon metastasized into an all-out revolt against state repression. Students remained at the forefront of the movement and were a key constituent of the interim government. However, the fact that the National Citizen Party (NCP) formed by student leaders entered into an alliance with Jamaat alienated many female and minority members.</p>



<p>From the heady days post-revolution, the student movement splintered, and the electoral dominance of the traditional parties has left many young people disillusioned&mdash;not least since women stood at the vanguard of the July revolution yet were largely sidelined in the reform process.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I do believe there is hope for a genuine political alternative in Bangladesh,&rdquo; says Tasnim Jara, a former NCP leader who quit and stood, <a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh-election-2026/dhaka-9-bnps-habib-leads-3482-votes-tasnim-jara-ncps-javed-trail-4-centres"  target="_blank">unsuccessfully</a>, as an independent in the Dhaka-9 constituency. &ldquo;But it will not emerge overnight. It will come from citizens with professional integrity entering politics, staying principled under pressure, and building trust slowly at the local level. If that succeeds even in one constituency, it shows that the old guard is not the only future available to us.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Rahman, for his part, says he is determined to honor the memory of those who gave everything for democracy: &ldquo;We have a very, very strong responsibility to those people who lost their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2261184916.jpg" alt="Back To The Future - Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics"/>



<p>At their fourth Olympics, <a href="https://time.com/7371645/madison-chock-evan-bates-olympics-2026-figure-skating-interview/" >Madison Chock and Evan Bates</a> finally have an Olympic medal in ice dance.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not the gold the U.S. duo was hoping for, but a silver, 1.43 points behind gold medalists Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron of France. Canada&rsquo;s Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier earned bronze, also their first Olympic medal in their third Games together.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The podium was full of surprises, as Great Britain&rsquo;s Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson, current world bronze medalists who were expected to be in the mix, finished in seventh after Fear faltered when performing the synchronized twizzles, or pirouettes on the ice, and received a lower level for her sequence than Gibson.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7371645/madison-chock-evan-bates-olympics-2026-figure-skating-interview/" ><em>Madison Chock, Evan Bates, and the Very Risky Skirt</em></a></p>



<p>Gilles and Poirier were mesmerizing in a program themed after Vincent Van Gogh&rsquo;s <em>Starry Night</em> and <em>Sunflowers</em> paintings. Gilles, a cancer survivor, trained for Milan while undergoing treatment for early-stage ovarian cancer, and she dedicated her journey to her mother, who supported her skating career and passed away from glioblastoma in 2018. Always the bridesmaid at the Olympics, the couple finally have their Olympic medal.</p>



<p>While there was certainly drama on the ice with the closeness of the results, there was an equally intense story building off the ice around the French team, whom U.S. figure skater and commentator <a href="https://time.com/5144215/adam-rippon-olympics-mike-pence/" >Adam Rippon</a> described as having &ldquo;sinister energy&rdquo; in the Netflix documentary <em>Glitter &amp; Gold</em> that presciently chronicled the journey of the three teams. </p>



<p>Just before the Olympics, Cizeron&rsquo;s former partner, Gabriella Papadakis, with whom he won gold at the 2022 Olympics, released her memoir, <em>So As Not to Disappear</em>, detailing what she describes as domineering and controlling behavior by Cizeron, to the point that she was terrified of being alone with him. Cizeron denied the reports, calling them a &ldquo;smear campaign&rdquo; and saying that the book &ldquo;contains false information, attributing to me, among other things, statements I have never made which I consider serious.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Papadakis was scheduled to join NBC as a skating analyst in Milan but was removed from the job following the release of the book. &ldquo;Her new book creates a clear conflict of interest,&rdquo; an NBC spokesperson said in a statement. &ldquo;Our responsibility is to deliver coverage that our audience can trust to be free of bias&mdash;whether actual or perceived&mdash;and we regret that is no longer possible given the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Papadakis retired from competitive skating in 2024&mdash;and left her training facility, the <a href="https://time.com/6146993/ice-dancing-olympics-2022-teams/" >Ice Academy of Montreal</a>&mdash;in part, she says, because of the uncomfortable environment at the school. Contributing to that was Fournier Beaudry&rsquo;s former partner, and still boyfriend, Nikolaj Sorensen; the couple competed for Canada and also trained at the Montreal facility. </p>



<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/7377586/2026-winter-olympics-ilia-malinin-figure-skating-men-short-program/" ><em>&#8216;Quad God&rsquo; Ilia Malinin Leads in Men&rsquo;s Skating Short Program</em></a></p>



<p>Sorensen was suspended from the sport in 2024 by Skate Canada after Canada&rsquo;s Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner investigated him for alleged sexual assault involving a U.S. coach and former figure skater. Sorensen denied the allegation and appealed the suspension, which was overturned on jurisdictional grounds in 2025, though an arbitration board has decided the legal decision should be further reviewed. Fournier Beaudry had already begun her new partnership with Cizeron, representing France, after receiving French citizenship several months ago.</p>



<p>Still, Fournier Beaudry has remained by Sorensen&rsquo;s side, and in the documentary she said the ban ended both their careers. &ldquo;I know my boyfriend 100%. I know him. And we [stood] strong together,&rdquo; she said. Asked in Milan about her support of her boyfriend, Fournier Beaudry declined to respond, saying only that she had said everything she wanted to say on the topic.</p>



<p>French journalists reported that Sorensen was spotted in the Milano Ice Skating Arena to watch Fournier Beaudry, adding to the tension between the French and Americans.</p>



<p>When asked after the competition about the controversies surrounding their ex-partners, Cizeron said, &ldquo;From the beginning we tried to create a bubble where we really supported each other through everything. We&rsquo;ve been through some incredibly hard moments. But the love we have for each other and for the sport brought us through. It helped us refocus on enjoying those moments together, because they don&rsquo;t last forever and we didn&rsquo;t want that taken away from us.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Chock couldn&rsquo;t hold back the tears as she admitted winning silver was a &ldquo;bittersweet feeling. At the moment, we have so much to be proud of, we&rsquo;ve had the most incredible career, 15 years on the ice together, the first Olympics as a married couple, and we delivered four of the best performances this week,&rdquo; she said, referring to the short and free programs she and Bates skated in the ice dance event as well as the short and free programs they skated in the <a href="https://time.com/7345540/2026-us-olympic-figure-skating-team-men-women-pairs-dance/" >team event, where they and their teammates won gold</a>. But it was the gold in ice dance that has been the North Star of their career, and she couldn&rsquo;t contain her emotions realizing that that gold remained elusive. She choked up as she talked about the support they have received throughout their career from family and friends. &ldquo;We are really proud &hellip; and grateful to our coaches and our families. They came all this way and have supported us through it all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It means so much to us to be a part of this sport, and to have contributed years of work and creativity to hopefully inspire the next generation of skaters.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The fight for gold and silver actually began before the opening ceremony in Milan, in the first round of that team event. In the rhythm dance, Chock and Bates outscored the French team by 1.08 points. In that competition, the judges gave Chock and Bates the highest level, 4, in all of their technical elements, while Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron received a level 3 for one of theirs, which earned them fewer points.</p>



<p>Once the individual skating events began, the circumstances reversed, and in the rhythm dance portion on Feb. 9, Chock and Bates received a level 3 for their pattern step sequence, while the judges awarded Fournier Beaudy and Cizeron a level 4 for that element.</p>



<p>And to make things even more complicated, the two teams train together at the Ice Academy of Montreal, sharing coaches Marie-France Dubreuil, Patrice Lauzon, and Romain Hagenauer. After the team event, Hagenauer said he and Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron worked to clean up the sequence that resulted in the lower level, which paid off when they competed it again in the individual event. The French finished 0.46 points ahead of the Americans after that first portion of the competition, a difference Chock and Bates thought they could easily make up in the free program.</p>



<p>In that segment, however, the scoring was also close. Chock and Bates skated first, ticking off their elements with the same precision they had in the team event, taking full advantage of the drama embedded in their matador-inspired routine. &ldquo;We felt like we skated a winning performance,&rdquo; said Bates.</p>



<p>Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron then took to the ice their more lyrical and abstract program set to the soundtrack from <em>The Whale</em>, with choreography meant to mimic the ebb and flow and constant movement of water. They outscored Chock and Bates in both technical elements, which focus on specific skating skills, as well as components, which reflect how the couple composed their program, presented it, and executed the elements.</p>



<p>In ice dance, which doesn&rsquo;t have the eye-catching jumps or spins that singles skating does, it&rsquo;s all about the precision of the skaters&rsquo; edges and the complexity of how their blades move across the ice, especially during step sequences, where they must follow specific criteria about which edges they need to achieve and how long they need to hold them.</p>



<p>Chock seemed in shock by the reality of not winning the gold; when the silver medals were placed around their necks, neither she nor Bates looked at them, and Chock stared stoically ahead throughout the ceremony. Neither commented on what their future holds, but being in their 30s, it&rsquo;s reasonable to think they saw this as their last Olympics and were hoping to end on a more positive note.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I feel like in life sometimes,&rdquo; Bates reflected, &ldquo;you do everything right and it doesn&rsquo;t go your way, and that&rsquo;s life, that&rsquo;s sport&mdash;it&rsquo;s a subjective sport, it&rsquo;s a judged sport. But one factor that is indisputable is we delivered our best. We skated our best. And the rest is not up to us.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Whether Chock and Bates decide to keep competing, the next generation of U.S. ice dancers is already showing promise. Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko finished 11th at their first Games. And U.S. silver medalists Emelia Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik finished fifth in their first Olympics, skating impressive programs that seemed to catch the attention of the judges. &ldquo;If you told me one year ago today I&rsquo;d be top five at the Olympics, I would have said it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said Zingas. &ldquo;It was the most emotion that I&rsquo;ve given on the ice so far this season, and it just felt magical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A suspect has been identified in the mass shooting in a remote British Columbia town that left nine people dead, including the person believed to be the attacker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Police identified the suspected shooter as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, who was found dead at the school where the shooting occurred from what police described as a self&#8209;inflicted injury. Six victims were also found dead in the school, and two more at a nearby home. More than 25 people were wounded<a href="https://time.com/6258603/canada-gun-violence-rise-us/" > in the rampage</a>, including two who were airlifted to hospital from the school with serious injuries.</p>

<p>The town of Tumbler Ridge is some 600 miles from the nearest large city, Vancouver, in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies. It has a population of 2,400.</p>

<p>Mass shootings in Canada are rare due to the country&rsquo;s strict gun laws. But locals have described Tumbler Ridge as a hunting town where gun ownership is common, in interviews with the media.</p>



<p>The shooting at Tumbler Ridge may be the deadliest school shooting since 14 women were killed in the Ecole Polytechnique massacre in Montreal on Dec. 6, 1989, before the gunman took his own life.</p>



<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a post on social media that he was &ldquo;devastated&rdquo; by what he described as &ldquo;horrific acts of violence.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#8220;I join Canadians in grieving with those whose lives have been changed irreversibly today, and in gratitude for the courage and selflessness of the first responders who risked their lives to protect their fellow citizens,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>World leaders have also offered condolences in the wake of the shooting. In a <a href="https://x.com/RoyalFamily/status/2021588046903214181"  target="_blank">statement</a> posted on the Royal Family&rsquo;s X account, King Charles III expressed &ldquo;our deepest possible sympathy to the families who are grieving the most unimaginable loss of their loved ones and those still awaiting news from hospital.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka called the town &ldquo;one big family&rdquo; that would be mourning the tragedy. Hundreds gathered on Wednesday evening for a candlelight vigil in Tumbler Ridge.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about the shooting so far.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How the attack unfolded&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said they received a report of an &ldquo;active shooter&rdquo; at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School at approximately 1:20 pm on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jarbas Noronha, who teaches a 12th grade auto mechanic shop class at the school, told the New York<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/10/world/tumbler-ridge-school-shooting"  target="_blank"> <em>Times</em></a> that he learned of the shooting when a student came running to the shop saying they heard gunshots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Minutes later, he said, the principal ran to the shop and shouted &ldquo;Lockdown!&rdquo; He and the students then barricaded the doors with metal benches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Police entered the school to find six victims, approximately 25 others who had been wounded, and the person believed to be the shooter, who was &ldquo;found deceased with what appears to be a self&#8209;inflicted injury,&rdquo; according to a<a href="https://rcmp.ca/en/bc/tumbler-ridge/news/2026/02/4350182"  target="_blank"> release</a> from the RCMP. All remaining students and staff were safely evacuated, police said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The victims found dead at the school included a 39-year-old teacher and five students aged 12 to 13, according to the RCMP.</p>



<p>Video from the scene showed students exiting the school with their hands raised, while a helicopter landed nearby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RCMP Superintendent Ken Floyd told reporters following the incident: &ldquo;The scene was very dramatic, and there were multiple victims that are still being cared for.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two people, a 12-year-old and a 19-year-old, were airlifted from the school to hospital with serious injuries, police said. The 12-year-old has been identified as Maya, according to a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-maya-in-her-road-to-recovery"  target="_blank">GoFundMe page</a> set up by her relative. As of early Thursday, she was in critical condition at Vancouver Children&rsquo;s Hospital, having suffered from gunshot wounds to the head and neck.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This doesnt even feel real,&rdquo; Maya&rsquo;s mother, Cia Edmonds, wrote in a note on the page. &ldquo;I never thought I would be asking for prayers.. but please please, pray for my baby.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Approximately 25 other people were being treated at local medical facilities for non&#8209;life&#8209;threatening injuries.</p>



<p>Tumbler Ridge Secondary School has 175 students, according to the<a href="https://studentsuccess.gov.bc.ca/school/05959027/report/contextual-information"  target="_blank"> provincial government</a>.</p>



<p>Police said a long gun and a modified handgun were recovered from the school.</p>



<p>Authorities also found two deceased victims, a 39-year-old woman and an 11-year-old boy, at a home nearby.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do we know about the suspect?</strong></h2>



<p>Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old resident of Tumbler Ridge, previously attended the school but dropped out about four years ago, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald.</p>



<p>McDonald said authorities visited Van Rootselaar&rsquo;s home &ldquo;on multiple occasions over the past several years&rdquo; in response to concerns about her mental health, most recently in the &ldquo;spring of last year.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I can say that on different occasions, the suspect was apprehended for assessment and follow up,&rdquo; he said, adding that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too early to say whether that has any correlation in this investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The motive for the shooting is not yet clear.</p>



<p>Police identified the victims found at the home near the school as Van Rootselaar&rsquo;s mother, Jennifer Strang, and step-brother. McDonald said they appeared to have been killed at the residence, Van Rootselaar&#8217;s family home, before the shooting at the school, and were found following the attack after a &#8220;young female relative&#8221; called the police.</p>



<p>A B.C. Supreme Court judge <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/shooter-tumbler-ridge-what-we-know-teenage-suspect-9.7085858"  target="_blank">reportedly</a> wrote that Strang&rsquo;s children &ldquo;led an almost nomadic life&rdquo; in a ruling in a 2015 family case, noting that the family had moved multiple times around the country.</p>



<p>McDonald said firearms were at one point seized from the home, but were later returned after &ldquo;the lawful owner of those firearms&rdquo; petitioned for them to be.</p>



<p>Van Rootselaar had a firearms license that expired in 2024, according to authorities, and did not have any guns registered in her name at the time of the shooting.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There is no information at this point that anyone was specifically targeted,&rdquo; McDonald said. He said none of the victims at the school were related to Van Rootselaar.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are Canada&rsquo;s gun laws?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Mass shootings are rare in Canada, but not unheard of. Its gun laws are much stricter than in the United States, but gun ownership is still widespread&mdash;especially in<a href="https://angusreid.org/gun-control-handgun-ban/"  target="_blank"> rural areas</a>, where they are mostly used for hunting.</p>



<p>The Canadian government estimates that about 10,040,000 firearms are in circulation, according to its latest data, which is<a href="https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/trnsprnc/brfng-mtrls/prlmntry-bndrs/20221122/06-en.aspx"  target="_blank"> from 2020</a>.</p>



<p>Canadians must have a license to own a firearm. To hold a license, they must be at least 18 and complete a safety course every five years. Certain types of guns&mdash;like handguns&mdash;must be registered.</p>



<p>Some exceptions are made for indigenous communities, who use guns for hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canada has made several changes to its gun laws in response to mass shootings. Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced new restrictions in 2020 following a mass shooting in Portapique, Nova Scotia.</p>



<p>That shooting, in which 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman carried out multiple shootings and set fires at several locations while driving a fake police car, killing 22 people, was the deadliest shooting rampage in Canadian history.</p>



<p>Days after the attack, Trudeau announced a ban on some 1,500 types of assault-style weapons. Since then, the Canadian government has<a href="https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/cntrng-crm/frrms/index-en.aspx"  target="_blank"> banned</a> more than 2,500 makes and models of &ldquo;assault-style firearms.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Canadian government also has a &ldquo;buyback&rdquo; scheme for military-style assault rifles.</p>

<p>TIME has published its annual list of <a href="https://time.com/collection/worlds-best-companies-2025-asia-pacific/" ><a href="https://time.com/7377459/asia-pacific-best-companies-2026/">Asia-Pacific&#8217;s Best Companies</a></a>, in partnership with Statista, a leading international provider of market and consumer data and rankings. The result of this quantitative study: 500 companies shaping the Asia-Pacific region&#8217;s role in global business. Here&#8217;s how the winners were selected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Methodology</h2>



<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://time.com/7377459/asia-pacific-best-companies-2026/" >Asia-Pacific&#8217;s Best Companies of 2026</a>&#8221; ranking is a comprehensive analysis aimed to identify the top performing companies in the Asia-Pacific region. The ranking focuses on three key dimensions: Employee Satisfaction, Financial Performance, and Sustainability Transparency (ESG).</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The first dimension, Employee Satisfaction, was evaluated using survey data from 2024 from employees worldwide with a main focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The surveys were conducted across the Asia-Pacific region with data collected from more than 50,000 participants. The evaluation encompassed evaluations of companies based on direct and indirect recommendations.</p>



<p>The second dimension, Financial Performance, was assessed using data from Statista&rsquo;s financial database and targeted research. The companies had to meet certain criteria to be considered for the evaluation, including generating a revenue of at least US $100 million in 2024. Companies also needed to either demonstrate positive revenue growth from 2022 to 2024 or generate a profit in 2024. Both relative and absolute growth were considered in the evaluation.</p>



<p>The third dimension, Sustainability Transparency, was evaluated based on ESG data among standardized KPIs from Statista&rsquo;s ESG Database and targeted data research. To formulate a comprehensive ESG index, multiple Key Performance Indicators were collected. For the environmental evaluation, this included the 2023 carbon emissions intensity and reduction rate compared to 2021, as well as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) score. The social dimension assessed the share of women on the board of directors and the existence of a human rights policy. The governance dimension evaluated whether a company had a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report adhering to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and a compliance or anti- corruption guideline.</p>



<p>Once the data was collected and evaluated, it was consolidated and weighted within a scoring model. The scores of all three dimensions were added on an equal percentage basis to form the final ranking score of a maximum of 100 points. The 500 companies with the highest scores were awarded as the <a href="https://time.com/7377459/asia-pacific-best-companies-2026/" >Asia-Pacific&#8217;s Best Companies of 2026</a> by TIME and Statista.</p>

<p>Anxiety gripped global markets when Donald Trump returned to the White House last year. But a year on, despite the U.S. President&rsquo;s game-changing policies, much of the Asia-Pacific region appears to have insulated itself from the shocks, with businesses and economies changing tactics to rely less on the U.S.</p>



<p>Banking and financial services once again dominate the latest statistical ranking of 500 of the region&rsquo;s best companies conducted by TIME and <a href="https://r.statista.com/en/licensing/worlds-best-companies-2023/award/"  target="_blank">Statista</a>, which assesses firms using three key metrics: employee satisfaction, revenue growth, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) evaluations. While 2025 started rocky with Trump&rsquo;s tariff war, the Asia-Pacific region stabilized towards the yearend, says Daniel Kritenbrink, formerly U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and now partner at The Asia Group. &ldquo;Compared to earlier in 2025, most businesses face a slightly more clear, stable, and certain business environment that they can plan around,&rdquo; he says.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p><strong>Methodology: <a href="https://time.com/7377673/asia-pacifics-best-companies-2026-methodology/" >How TIME and Statista Determined Asia-Pacific&#8217;s Best Companies of 2026</a></strong></p>



<p>Of this cohort&rsquo;s top 10, five are from the banking sector, with Singapore&rsquo;s DBS Bank keeping the top spot from last year, followed by Australia&rsquo;s Commonwealth Bank. Both firms reported profitability&mdash;despite the volatile macroeconomic environment&mdash;and wide adoptions of AI in their practices. Rounding out the top 10 is the Philippines&rsquo; Bank of the Philippine Islands, the country&rsquo;s best-performing company on the list.</p>



<p>The financial sector has a rosy outlook for 2026, says Taimur Baig, chief economist and managing director at DBS Bank, signaled by initial public offerings from Hong Kong and Singapore reviving moribund regional capital markets, and rallying bank stocks. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an expectation of equity capital markets catching tailwind,&rdquo; Baig says. He expects market confidence will increase, allowing companies to take higher risks&mdash;including in the artificial intelligence sector&mdash;which means more business for banks.</p>



<p>The automotive industry, a victim of Trump&rsquo;s aggressive tariffs, survived through persistent EV demand. Toyota&mdash;which retained its world&rsquo;s top-selling automaker status this year thanks to strong U.S. sales of hybrid vehicles&mdash;ranked third in the list, followed by Hyundai (no. 8) and Honda (no. 12). Chinese companies Xiaomi (no. 23), BYD (no. 43), and Geely (no. 60)&mdash;also known for their EV offerings&mdash;similarly made the cut. Xiaomi is China&rsquo;s best-performing business this year, as the second-largest economy faces ongoing domestic struggles in automotive sales, and its overproduction is spilling into other nations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The insurance, healthcare, and social services sector also performed well, and are projected to sustain expansion, with the Asia-Pacific region anticipated to boost global life insurance premium volumes. The list includes Australia&rsquo;s QBE Insurance Group (no. 7), AIA Group in Hong Kong (no. 15), and SBI Life Insurance from India (no.19).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Region-specific growths are also evident: of the top 10 companies, four are from Australia, whose sluggish economy slightly recovered in 2025. Alicia Garc&iacute;a-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at French financial services firm Natixis, says that Australia &ldquo;delivered consistency rather than fireworks&rdquo; with its strong financials and its cornerstone mining industry. She also points to select strengths in the pharmaceutical, medical technology, and consumer goods sectors; Australia&rsquo;s largest retailer of consumer goods, Woolworths, ranks sixth in the list.</p>



<p>Zooming out, however, Indian firms form the lion&rsquo;s share, taking up 179 spots in the list. But Garc&iacute;a-Herrero notes that India shining as a &ldquo;bright spot&rdquo; on the market does not necessarily indicate outstanding performance. The country saw periods of high volatility, with <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/foreign-investors-may-return-to-india-but-not-everyone-is-convinced-it-matters-alpha-article-19841548.htm"  target="_blank">foreign investment outflow</a> amid a weak rupee and tariffs, though India still managed to <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/1102431/ado-december-2025.pdf"  target="_blank">pull regional economic forecasts</a> upward due to robust domestic consumption. </p>



<p>India is expected to edge out Japan in the race for the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest economy title, but the two nations <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl%2F40066%2FFact+Sheet++IndiaJapan+Economic+Security+Cooperation"  target="_blank">ramped up</a> their economic partnership last year, focusing on the semiconductor, clean energy, critical minerals, and information and communications technology sectors. Three Japanese companies on the list&mdash;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (no. 4), Mizuho Financial Group (no. 17), and MUFG (no. 52)&mdash;have also expanded into India&rsquo;s financial services, betting on the South Asian market&rsquo;s rapid growth. Overall, recalibration became the year&rsquo;s business buzzword for Asia-Pacific, and with Trump thrusting the world into more uncertainty, players in the region sought solutions in bilateral and multilateral cooperation beyond the U.S.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a $4.7 billion bridge connecting Detroit, Michigan, to Windsor, Ontario, in the latest display of frayed relations between the U.S. and Canada.</p>



<p>In a lengthy social media post, Trump raised a number of issues against his northern neighbor and doubled down on his often-cited claim that Canada has &ldquo;treated the United States very unfairly for decades.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The President claimed that Canada will own both sides of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, for which construction <a href="https://gordiehoweinternationalbridge.com/project/our-story/"  target="_blank">began</a> in 2018 and is nearing completion, and complained that the infrastructure has been built with &ldquo;virtually no U.S. content.&rdquo;</p>



<p>After accusing Ontario of refusing to stock some U.S.-produced alcoholic products in shops and complaining about Canada&#8217;s tariffs on dairy products, Trump declared he will &ldquo;not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated&rdquo; for everything it has &ldquo;given&rdquo; to Canada.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We will start negotiations immediately,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday told reporters he had spoken with Trump about a number of topics, including the bridge. &ldquo;I explained that Canada, of course, paid for the construction of the bridge, over $4 billion. That the ownership is shared between the state of Michigan and the government of Canada,&rdquo; Carney said. He pushed back against Trump&#8217;s claims about the building materials, arguing that both Canadian and U.S. steel had been used. The Prime Minister went on to say the &ldquo;situation will be settled,&rdquo; but offered no further details.</p>



<p>Carney&#8217;s response points to the <a href="https://gordiehoweinternationalbridge.com/the-canada-michigan-crossing-agreement/"  target="_blank">Canada-Michigan Crossing Agreement</a>, signed in June 2012, which states that the Canadian government will pay for the bridge, and use toll funds&mdash;collected over 30 years&mdash;as reimbursement.</p>



<p>The agreement also stipulates that the bridge, named after prolific Canadian ice hockey player Gordie Howe, will be publicly owned by the governments of Canada and Michigan, and all iron and steel used in construction will be sourced from either the U.S. or Canada. The offer from the Canadian government to cover most of the costs was accepted by Michigan&#8217;s then-Gov. Rick Snyder.</p>



<p>All seemed to be going well in February 2017, when Trump and then-Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/joint-statement-president-donald-j-trump-prime-minister-justin-trudeau/"  target="_blank">a joint statement,</a> celebrating the project and calling the crossing &ldquo;a vital economic link between our two countries.&rdquo;</p>



<p>More recently, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://assets.aila.org/files/646f12ba-d503-4e8f-949c-d1ef1d47e135/26020202.pdf?1770050442"  target="_blank">published a rule</a> on Jan. 30, declaring the bridge will serve as an official port of entry. It said the crossing will save $12.7 million annually for travelers, in part by reducing congestion.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s new threat to suspend the bridge&rsquo;s opening has prompted criticism among Canadian officials.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just insane. When I read that post, I really can&#8217;t believe what I&#8217;m reading,&rdquo; Mayor of Windsor Drew Dilkens <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/video/9.7082187"  target="_blank">told</a> CBC, adding that the bridge should create an opportunity &ldquo;where a Prime Minister would meet a President in the middle, they would shake hands, and they would celebrate this victory for two nations. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has created an environment where I don&#8217;t think that is going to happen in the near term.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Michigan Democrats have also criticized Trump&#8217;s statement regarding the multibillion dollar project.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Gordie Howe Bridge is an incredibly important infrastructure project for Michigan. President Trump&#8217;s threat tonight to tank it is awful for our state&#8217;s economy,&rdquo; <a href="https://x.com/SenatorSlotkin/status/2021013398129877408"  target="_blank">said</a> Sen. Elissa Slotkin. Canceling this project will have serious repercussions. Higher costs for Michigan businesses, less secure supply chains, and ultimately, fewer jobs.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Slotkin argued that Trump&#8217;s threat is merely &ldquo;punishing Michiganders for a trade war he started&rdquo; and, in reference to Canada&#8217;s recent talks with China, went on to say: &ldquo;the only reason Canada is on the verge of a trade deal with China is because President Trump has kicked them in the teeth for a year.&rdquo;</p>



<p>TIME has reached out to the White House for comment.</p>



<p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also expressed the importance of the construction efforts.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This project has been a tremendous example of bipartisan and international cooperation. It&#8217;s going to open one way or another, and the Governor looks forward to attending the ribbon cutting,&rdquo; said Whitmer&rsquo;s office in a statement to TIME.</p>



<p>However, some Michigan Republicans have come out in support of Trump. The state&#8217;s House Speaker Matt Hall echoed the President&#8217;s argument about U.S.-Canada relations.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Canada should treat us better and offer fair trade terms, especially when it comes to American farmers and liquor producers being unfairly targeted and having their products taken off of Canadian shelves,&rdquo; Hall said in a statement to TIME. &ldquo;President Trump is using the right leverage points to renegotiate better agreements&#8230; he will make sure Michigan and the United States come out ahead.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2210333398.jpg" alt="Spanning the Detroit River, the Gordie H" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s frustration over the bridge marks the latest tension between the President and Canada.</p>



<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Trump told attendees that Canada &ldquo;lives because of the United States.&rdquo; In a filmed address from Qu&eacute;bec City, <a href="https://time.com/7357333/carney-trump-row-united-states-canada-relationship/" >Carney responded to the claim</a>, firmly stating: &ldquo;Canada does not live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump had lashed out at Canada after taking umbrage at Carney&#8217;s own Davos speech, during which he boldly stated that the old world order is &ldquo;not coming back.&rdquo; He encouraged people not to &ldquo;mourn&rdquo; the way things used to be and advised that &ldquo;nostalgia is not a strategy.&rdquo; Carney urged middle powers to stand up for themselves, accusing &ldquo;great powers&rdquo; of using economic pressure to yield results.</p>



<p>While he did not name the U.S. or its President, Carney&#8217;s speech came in the midst of Trump attempting to acquire Greenland and after long-repeated threats to annex Canada and make it the &ldquo;<a href="https://time.com/7297490/trump-plan-to-annex-canada-51st-state-mark-carney/" >51st state</a>.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Carney has since explored alternative trade alliances and avenues for Canada. After traveling to Beijing last month to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he announced that Canada and China had forged a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2026/01/16/prime-minister-carney-forges-new-strategic-partnership-peoples"  target="_blank">new strategic partnership</a>&rdquo; focused on &ldquo;energy, agri-food, and trade.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump lashed out at the alliance while threatening the opening of the bridge, claiming China &ldquo;will eat Canada alive,&rdquo; leaving the U.S. with &ldquo;the leftovers.&rdquo; In a nod to the bridge&#8217;s namesake, he went on to predict that China will &ldquo;terminate all ice hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.&rdquo;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Critics say Hong Kong’s civil liberties have eroded under China’s “one country, two systems” model. Is Taiwan next?]]></description>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/jimmy-lai-taiwan.jpg" alt="Hong Kong activists and supporters gather in support of Hong Kong activist publisher Jimmy Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, on Feb. 10, 2026."/>



<p>When a Hong Kong court handed media tycoon and pro-democracy leader Jimmy Lai a two-decade jail term on national security grounds on Monday, his son called it a &ldquo;<a href="https://x.com/RidgeandFrost/status/2020777735811965028"  target="_blank">death sentence</a>&rdquo; given Lai&rsquo;s age, 78, and deteriorating health. Critics across the globe, meanwhile, have described the sentence as a death knell for a once more free Hong Kong&mdash;as well as a signal of what could be in store for other places China has its eye on, namely Taiwan.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;I believe that the way that China is treating Hong Kong is the way that it wants to treat Taiwan next, and beyond that, other countries,&rdquo; Mark Clifford, president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation in the U.S., told TIME before the sentence was handed down.</p>



<p>A Human Rights Watch spokesperson summed up the sentiment to TIME on Monday: &ldquo;Today is Hong Kong, tomorrow, Taiwan.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Lai, a vocal critic of China&rsquo;s increasing influence over Hong Kong&mdash;a special administrative region of China since the U.K. handed it over in 1997&mdash;and repression of pro-democratic voices, particularly after the passage of a <a href="https://time.com/5867000/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-effect/" >sweeping national security law</a> in 2020, was convicted in December of two counts of &ldquo;conspiring to collude with foreign forces,&rdquo; as well as of conspiring to publish seditious materials, as the founder of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily.</p>



<p>But while Hong Kong and Beijing authorities and media have backed Lai&rsquo;s sentence, Taiwan&mdash;the self-governed island which China claims sovereignty over&mdash;has condemned it. Taiwan&#8217;s Mainland Affairs Council said in a <a href="https://www.mac.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=05B73310C5C3A632&amp;sms=1A40B00E4C745211&amp;s=213FAE969E5552FE"  target="_blank">statement</a> that Lai&#8217;s harsh sentence &ldquo;not only deprives him of his personal liberty and tramples on freedom of speech and press freedom, but also denies the people&rsquo;s basic right to hold those in power accountable.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taiwan President William Lai Ching-te <a href="https://x.com/ChingteLai/status/2021106841296736478"  target="_blank">posted on X</a> on Tuesday that Lai&rsquo;s sentencing &ldquo;exposes the Hong Kong national security law for what it is&mdash;a tool of political persecution under China&rsquo;s &lsquo;one country, two systems&rsquo; that tramples human rights &amp; freedom of press,&rdquo; and he called for the media mogul&rsquo;s release.</p>



<p>Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, tells TIME that Lai&rsquo;s sentence would affirm to the Taiwanese government and its people that the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; principle currently governing Hong Kong &ldquo;is a future they cannot accept.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That system was actually designed with Taiwan in mind. Former Chinese leader <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/zy/wjls/3604_665547/202405/t20240531_11367561.html"  target="_blank">Deng Xiaoping</a> advanced the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; framework as a way for Taiwan to peacefully reunite with the mainland, while &ldquo;respect[ing] the realities and the existing system there.&rdquo; In a bid to make the principle more palatable to the Taiwanese government, China applied it to Hong Kong and Macau after the British and the Portuguese territories were ceded back to China in the late 1990s, allowing the so-called special administrative regions to operate with their own economic system and governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But <a href="https://time.com/5786776/hong-kong-joshua-wong-future-homeland/" >pro-democracy figures</a> have argued that local governance has grown increasingly aligned with the mainland as political dissidents have either been jailed or exiled, organizations have disbanded, and a free press dismantled.</p>



<p>&ldquo;You take a model that&rsquo;s intended for Taiwan, you try it out in Hong Kong, and we&rsquo;ve seen how it works out,&rdquo; Clifford told TIME on Monday, adding that the freedoms and autonomy China promised to Hong Kong and the international community under the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; framework have all but disappeared. &ldquo;Of course, Taiwan feels like it&rsquo;s next.&rdquo; </p>

					<description><![CDATA[A total U.S. blockade on oil has caused a severe energy crisis across Cuba. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7373215"></div></div>
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/7373215/cuba-us-blockade-oil-venezuela/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2258177076.jpg" alt="CUBA-ENERGY-BLACKOUT"/>



<p>A United States-imposed blockade on oil to <a href="https://time.com/7344661/cuba-trump-venezuela-oil-economy-crisis/" >Cuba</a> is causing a severe energy crisis on the island that has resulted in rolling blackouts, a strain on hospitals and the grounding of jets.</p>



<p>On Monday, Cuban aviation authorities notified international airlines that the country is running out of jet fuel and that refuelling services for airlines will be suspended for a month, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration. Air Canada said it was suspending its service to the island as a result. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>It comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month announcing that he would impose tariffs on any country that sells or provides oil to Cuba, which is run by a communist government that the Trump Administration would <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/the-u-s-is-actively-seeking-regime-change-in-cuba-by-the-end-of-the-year-1d0f178a?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfD7nhTDrKn_16qb5KWi3zhda3cwzfZmLjUVci37o07fek9ad6MMRLBTljh0bc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=698a41c8&amp;gaa_sig=y3Q0RhpBghK250_qDtCo3G3ab8qU3S4nVwXK1H6pSG7mewy9h2tFYAJtG9XmUJA3xTzsXxiCg7EOoUoaEjrrgQ%3D%3D"  target="_blank">like to</a> replace.  </p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/" ><em>What&rsquo;s Happening With the U.S. and Venezuela, Explained</em></a></p>



<p>The island&rsquo;s economy was already struggling due to decades of U.S. sanctions, but things rapidly deteriorated in January when shipments were halted from its main supplier, Venezuela, following a U.S. military operation to depose President Nicolas Maduro.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mexico, another oil supplier to Cuba, also announced on Monday that it was suspending its shipments after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican exports to the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Financial <em>Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f15ac8c6-c76b-40a1-bb41-95abbed7d8aa"  target="_blank">reported</a> in late January that Cuba only has oil reserves that could last for &ldquo;15 to 20 days&rdquo; at the current level of demand. </p>



<p>Some medical facilities have also been severely impacted by the fuel shortages. Local media <a href="https://www.14ymedio.com/cuba/cuba-acerca-opcion-cero-suspenden_1_1123458.html"  target="_blank">reported</a> that some provincial hospitals have canceled surgeries and outpatient transfers. Critical medical supplies such as painkillers, gauze, and antibiotics are also unavailable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fuel shortage has also strained the country&#8217;s food supplies. Last week, the U.S. gave $6 million in humanitarian aid to the country, the State Department said. The supplies include rice, beans, pasta, cans of tuna and solar lamps that will be delivered by the Catholic Church and Caritas. Mexico is also <a href="https://x.com/SRE_mx/status/2020603217852424637"  target="_blank">sending</a> more than 814 tons of food and hygiene products to Cuba, which is scheduled to arrive in a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The United Nations warned last week that the &ldquo;vast majority of Cubans&rdquo; are being hit by rolling blackouts, and that the humanitarian collapse would &ldquo;worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The last two years have been quite tough,&rdquo; said Francisco Pichon, the most senior United Nations official in Cuba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to the oil blockade, the Caribbean island suffered from a withering economy due to its dwindling tourism business since the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, Hurricane Melissa also swept Cuba&rsquo;s five provinces, displacing more than 735,000 people while destroying homes and basic infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent days, as the energy crisis has worsened, the Cuban government has called for dialogue with the U.S. government. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Monday denounced the &#8220;cruel aggression&#8221; of the United States, which he said was aimed at &#8220;breaking the political will of the Cuban people.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The situation is tough and will demand great sacrifice,&#8221; said Rodriguez, while reiterating Cuba&#8217;s &#8220;willingness to engage in dialogue&#8221;, though on its own terms without pressure.</p>



<p>Trump said in early February that the U.S. is engaging in diplomatic conversations with &ldquo;the highest people&rdquo; in Cuba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It doesn&#8217;t have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal,&rdquo; Trump said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s remarks came not long after Secretary Marco Rubio acknowledged that the U.S. would like to see the end of the communist regime in Cuba.<br><br>&ldquo;That doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re going to make a change, but we would love to see a change,&#8221; Rubio <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rubio-rules-military-action-venezuela-now/story?id=129637763"  target="_blank">told</a> a Congressional hearing late last month.<br><br>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about the fact that it would be a great benefit to the United States if Cuba was no longer governed by an autocratic regime,&#8221; Rubio added.</p>



<p>Cuba&rsquo;s deputy foreign minister dismissed that possibility in an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/04/tv/video/carlos-fernandez-de-cossio-cuba-amanpour"  target="_blank">interview</a> with CNN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not ready to discuss our constitutional system as we suppose the U.S. is not ready to discuss their constitutional system, their political system, their economic reality,&rdquo; Carlos Fern&aacute;ndez de Coss&iacute;o said.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-09-at-18.10.24.png" alt=""/>



<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing growing calls to resign <a href="https://time.com/7372763/epstein-files-united-kingdom-peter-mandelson-prince-andrew-starmer/" >amid the fallout</a> from his former Labour colleague Peter Mandelson&rsquo;s relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>



<p>Anas Sarwar, leader of the Scottish Labour Party, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Reuters/videos/802890309491041/"  target="_blank">urged</a> Starmer to step down during a press conference on Monday afternoon.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>&ldquo;This isn&#8217;t easy, and it&#8217;s not without pain, as I have a genuine friendship with Keir Starmer, but my first priority and my first loyalty is to my country, Scotland,&rdquo; he said, citing fears that the scandal in Westminster risks overshadowing the Scottish Parliament election in May. &ldquo;The distraction needs to end, and the leadership in Downing Street has to change.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Sarwar faced questions himself this past week when a <a href="https://x.com/AnasSarwar/status/1908204710143942907?ref=ed_direct"  target="_blank">resurfaced social media post</a> showed him referring to Mandelson as an &ldquo;old friend&rdquo; after they shared a meeting last April. The Scottish lawmaker defended the meeting once more on Monday, saying Mandelson shouldn&rsquo;t have been in office in the first place.</p>



<p>Starmer&rsquo;s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney resigned from his position over the weekend, claiming responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Mandelson as the U.K. ambassador to Washington&mdash;a move that is under increasing scrutiny, as the lawmaker&#8217;s ties to Epstein were known to some extent.</p>



<p>Tim Allan, Starmer&rsquo;s director of communications, followed suit on Monday, resigning from his position in what appeared to be an attempt to ease the pressure on Starmer.</p>



<p>But for some, it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>



<p><strong>Read More</strong>: <em><a href="https://time.com/7372763/epstein-files-united-kingdom-peter-mandelson-prince-andrew-starmer/" >How the Epstein Files Broke Britain</a></em></p>



<p>Mandelson was <a href="https://time.com/7316349/peter-mandelson-fired-uk-ambassador-united-states-epstein-controversy/" >sacked</a> from the role of ambassador in September after a previous release of files showed that his relationship with Epstein stretched beyond what was previously known. </p>



<p>That appointment is under renewed <a href="https://time.com/7372763/epstein-files-united-kingdom-peter-mandelson-prince-andrew-starmer/" >inspection</a> as emails from the latest release of files appear to show Mandelson <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00775718.pdf"  target="_blank">leaked</a> sensitive government information to Epstein during his time as Business Secretary under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown. A <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/update-searches-concluded-re-misconduct-in-public-office-investigation-505947"  target="_blank">police investigation</a> into Mandelson for alleged misconduct in public office offences is now underway.</p>



<p>Mandelson resigned from the Labour Party and stepped down from the House of Lords last week. Amid calls for Starmer to follow suit, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister on Monday said he will not be resigning.</p>



<p> &ldquo;The Prime Minister is concentrating on the job in hand. He is getting on with the job of delivering change across the country,&rdquo; the spokesperson said, adding that Starmer is &ldquo;confident&rdquo; he has the full support of his Cabinet. Many Cabinet members have since rallied around the Prime Minister, with Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy among those vocalizing their support.</p>



<p>However, Starmer&rsquo;s premiership remains under scrutiny and some lawmakers are urging him to consider stepping down.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brian Leishman</strong></h2>



<p>Brian Leishman, a Scottish member of the Labour Party, fully supported Sarwar&rsquo;s message on Monday.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I have said that Keir Starmer&rsquo;s position is untenable and that it is in the country&rsquo;s best interest for him to step down and for the government to have a change in direction,&rdquo; Leishman said in a statement to TIME.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Sarwar has shown that he and Scottish Labour will act in the best interests of our country,&rdquo; Leishman added, urging a return to &rdquo;real Labour values.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ian Byrne</strong></h2>



<p>Ian Byrne is among the Labour lawmakers who welcomed McSweeney&rsquo;s resignation on Sunday, describing it as being in &ldquo;the best interests of the government.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He <a href="https://x.com/IanByrneMP/status/2020554763868205420"  target="_blank">claimed</a> Starmer&rsquo;s chief of staff had &ldquo;overseen the erosion of internal democracy and the normalization of a deeply damaging factionalism that members and MPs are now living with.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But McSweeney&rsquo;s resignation is not enough, according to Byrne.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;A true change in political direction must now come from&mdash;and be led from&mdash;the very top,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The PM must now reflect honestly on his own position and ask whether, for the good of the country and the Labour Party, he should follow McSweeney&rsquo;s lead.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Neil Duncan-Jordan</strong></h2>



<p>Neil Duncan-Jordan of the Labour Party said: &ldquo;We can&#8217;t just keep going on like this, lurching from one crisis to the next, and one of the best ways of resetting is to have renewal, and that means changing who&#8217;s in charge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked during an interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002qhtd"  target="_blank">BBC Radio Solent</a> who should replace Starmer as Prime Minister, Duncan-Jordan pointed to the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. </p>



<p>Labour&rsquo;s National Executive Committee (NEC) recently blocked Burnham from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election, prompting much tension.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We need to recognize that, for the good of the party and for the good of the country, we&#8217;re going to need a change,&rdquo; said Duncan-Jordan, citing other grievances he had with decisions made by Starmer during his premiership so far, such as a suggestion for means-tested winter fuel allowance and proposed amendments to <a href="https://time.com/7299472/united-kingdom-welfare-bill-controversy-starmer-rebellion/" >disability benefits</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong></h2>



<p>Leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, has strongly pushed for Starmer to resign since putting pressure on the Prime Minister in the House of Commons last week to answer questions over his appointment of Mandelson.</p>



<p>&ldquo;His [Starmer] position now is untenable, because if he thinks that bad advice is enough for Morgan McSweeney to go, then yes, I think that makes his position untenable,&rdquo; Badenoch said in an <a href="https://x.com/BBCr4today/status/2020786031100928165"  target="_blank">interview</a> with the BBC on Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Badenoch went on to criticize Starmer&rsquo;s handling of the entire Mandelson situation.</p>



<p>&ldquo;He needs to start governing the country. Everybody makes mistakes. How you handle them shows what sort of character you are. And what he is showing is that he is weak,&rdquo; she claimed.</p>



<p>Refusing to suggest an ideal replacement, should Starmer step down, Badenoch said: &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think there is a single better person on the Labour benches. Let&#8217;s just be clear&mdash;the problem is the Labour Party.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buckingham Palace said King Charles III will, if approached, support police as they assess claims related to his brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and his ties to the late convicted sex offender <a href="https://time.com/7372763/epstein-files-united-kingdom-peter-mandelson-prince-andrew-starmer/" >Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor&rsquo;s conduct,&rdquo; the statement read. &ldquo;While the specific claims in question are for Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police, we stand ready to support them as you would expect.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The statement came hours after Thames Valley Police confirmed to TIME that they are &ldquo;assessing the information&rdquo; regarding allegations that Andrew&mdash;while serving as the U.K. trade envoy&mdash;shared confidential government reports with Epstein, detailing trips to Singapore, China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in 2010 and 2011.</p>



<p>Last week, the same police force confirmed they are reviewing a fresh allegation that Epstein sent a woman to Andrew at the Royal Lodge residence in Windsor in 2010.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are aware of reports about a woman said to have been taken to an address in Windsor in 2010 for sexual purposes,&rdquo; a police spokesperson told TIME. &ldquo;We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.&rdquo;</p>



<p>TIME has reached out to Andrew&rsquo;s representatives for comment.</p>



<p>Andrew (formerly known as Prince Andrew) is under renewed scrutiny following the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s latest <a href="https://time.com/7372763/epstein-files-united-kingdom-peter-mandelson-prince-andrew-starmer/" >release of files</a> connected to Epstein. The <a href="https://time.com/7362936/epstein-files-india-slovakia/" >documents</a> include a photograph of Andrew leaning over a woman on the floor. The woman&rsquo;s face has been redacted and it&rsquo;s unclear when or where the photograph was taken.</p>



<p>Prince William and Kate Middleton addressed the files on Monday morning.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I can confirm the Prince and Princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations. Their thoughts remain focused on the victims,&rdquo; said a Kensington Palace spokesperson on behalf of the couple.</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re not the only royals to speak up, as Andrew&rsquo;s younger brother Prince Edward, when asked about the release of the new files during a summit in Dubai last week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK5ZAc3JY68&amp;t=16s"  target="_blank">said</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important, always, to remember the victims, and who are the victims in all of this? [There are] a lot of victims in this.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-09-at-12.01.53.png" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Epstein was initially sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in 2008 after pleading guilty to state charges&mdash;one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. He was in custody once more awaiting trial on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors when he <a href="https://time.com/5649271/jeffrey-epstein-suicide/" >died in a New York jail cell</a> in 2019.</p>



<p>Andrew&rsquo;s relationship with Epstein&mdash;and the fact he continued communicating with the disgraced financier after his initial conviction&mdash;has long been scrutinized.</p>



<p>The royal was famously interviewed on BBC&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6963952/scoop-netflix-true-story/" ><em>Newsnight</em></a> in 2019 and questioned over why he visited Epstein in New York in 2010. (The pair were pictured walking through Central Park together during the trip.)</p>



<p>Andrew was accused of sexual abuse himself by one of Epstein&rsquo;s most prominent victims, the late Virginia Giuffre. He strongly denied the allegations.</p>



<p>In January 2022, Andrew was stripped of his key military titles and royal patronages in the midst of a civil sexual abuse case brought forward by Giuffre. A month later, <a href="https://time.com/7326183/epstein-victim-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-memoir/" >he settled the lawsuit</a> with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount.</p>



<p>Andrew was stripped of the remainder of his titles in late 2025, after additional allegations by <a href="https://time.com/7333355/virginia-giuffre-jeffrey-epstein-donald-trump-emails/" >Giuffre (who died in April 2025)</a> came to light in her <a href="https://time.com/7326183/epstein-victim-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-memoir/" >posthumous memoir</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2211141145.jpg" alt="King Charles III And Queen Camilla Attend The 2025 Easter Service At St George's Chapel" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Sarah Ferguson, Andrew&rsquo;s ex-wife and the mother of his two daughters, has also faced renewed questioning over her own relationship with Epstein following mentions in the latest release of Epstein files. (The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing, nor is appearing in the files an indication of wrongdoing.)</p>



<p>According to the emails, Ferguson <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01857789.pdf"  target="_blank">continued communicating</a> with Epstein after his initial conviction.</p>



<p>In September, <a href="https://time.com/7319567/duchess-of-york-sarah-ferguson-jeffrey-epstein-email-controversy/" >multiple charities cut ties with Ferguson</a> after a previous drop of files revealed she had emailed Epstein and referred to him as a &ldquo;supreme friend.&rdquo; A spokesperson for Ferguson pointed to the former duchess&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/duchess-of-york-says-gushing-message-to-epstein-was-not-what-it-seemed-13435313"  target="_blank">regret</a>&rdquo; over her association with the financier.</p>



<hr/>



<p>While the revelations from the Epstein files continue to rock the royal family, the British government is also engulfed in controversy following the latest release of documents.</p>



<p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is in crisis, facing serious questions over his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as the U.K. ambassador to the U.S. in early 2025, despite it being known that he had a history with Epstein.</p>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7316349/peter-mandelson-fired-uk-ambassador-united-states-epstein-controversy/" >Mandelson was sacked as ambassador</a> in September after it came to light that he shared a closer relationship with Epstein than he&rsquo;d previously disclosed. The emails released by the DOJ in January proved to be even more damning, as they appear to show that Mandelson&mdash;while serving as Business Secretary under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown&mdash;may have leaked sensitive <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00775718.pdf"  target="_blank">government information</a> to Epstein in 2009.</p>



<p>Mandelson resigned from the ruling Labour Party last week, saying that he wanted to avoid causing it &ldquo;further embarrassment.&rdquo; He also stepped down from the House of Lords.</p>



<p>The U.K.&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police has <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/investigation-launched-into-alleged-misconduct-in-public-office-505806"  target="_blank">launched</a> an investigation into Mandelson &ldquo;for misconduct in public office offences.&rdquo; On Friday afternoon, local time, police <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/update-on-investigation-into-misconduct-in-public-office-offences-505940"  target="_blank">revealed</a> two properties linked to the former government minister had been searched in relation to the probe. Mandelson has not &ldquo;been arrested and enquiries are ongoing,&rdquo; the police said.</p>

<p>Starmer&rsquo;s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, resigned on Sunday, in the wake of the controversy. In a statement, he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Mandelson in the ambassador role.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself,&rdquo; said McSweeney. &ldquo;When asked, I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.&rdquo;</p>



<p>On Monday morning, Starmer&#8217;s executive director of communications, Tim Allan, also stepped down.</p>



<p>However, the departures have done little to curb calls for Starmer to resign.</p>



<p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, argued that Starmer &ldquo;has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions&rdquo; and said his position is &ldquo;<a href="https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/2020601071433818613"  target="_blank">untenable</a>.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Anas Sarwar, head of the Scottish Labour Party, said the &ldquo;leadership in Downing Street has to change.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/7373034/prime-minister-anutin-charnvirakul-thailand-election-result-bhumjaithai-interview-takeaways/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/anutin-thailand-election-results.jpg" alt="Bhumjaithai Party Election Night Event"/>



<p>When TIME sat down with <a href="https://time.com/7364304/thailand-prime-minister-anutin-charnvirakul-election/" >Anutin Charnvirakul</a> late last month, Thailand&rsquo;s Prime Minister was feeling the strain of the campaign trail. The 59-year-old grumbled that gladhanding throngs of supporters in dusty villages had left him prey to bugs and viruses. &ldquo;I meet so many people and sometimes maybe they have caught a cold,&rdquo; Anutin said from Bangkok&rsquo;s neo-Gothic Government House. &ldquo;I hear them coughing and try to hold my breath. But I might not be able to do that 100%.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Still, Anutin held yet another rally that very evening, and the sacrifice appears to have paid off handsomely. His conservative Bhumjaithai Party won the most seats in Thailand&rsquo;s general election on Sunday, besting a progressive movement that had been surging for years but lost its shine amid rising nationalism and economic doldrums.</p>



<p>With 90% of the vote counted, Bhumjaithai had 194 seats of the 500-seat House of Representatives, with <a href="https://time.com/7317196/thailand-natthaphong-ruengpanyawut-peoples-party-election-profile/" >the progressive People&rsquo;s Party</a> coming second with 116 seats, per an Election Commission tally, meaning Anutin will almost certainly retain the Southeast Asia nation&rsquo;s top job, albeit as head of a coalition.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We will accept the decision of the people in giving us the confidence, the trust to the Bhumjaithai Party,&rdquo; Anutin told reporters at his party&rsquo;s headquarters in Bangkok late Sunday.</p>



<p>Here are five takeaways from TIME&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7364304/thailand-prime-minister-anutin-charnvirakul-election/" >sweeping interview</a> with Anutin regarding his plans for the nation of 70 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Military influence here to stay</strong></h2>



<p>Anutin&rsquo;s victory capitalized on resurgent nationalism after months of <a href="https://time.com/7305413/thailand-cambodia-border-war-hun-sen-manet-paetongtarn-thaksin-shinawatra/" >bloody skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia</a> over their disputed frontier. While the progressive movement campaigned on reducing the bloated military&rsquo;s role in politics and business, the border spat emboldened Anutin to portray himself as a hawkish patriot protecting national pride and security. However, he also talked up his good relationship with Cambodia&rsquo;s Prime Minister Hun Manet, whom he described as &ldquo;very intelligent and capable&rdquo; to TIME. &ldquo;I always had great respect for him.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While pinning blame on Cambodia for the bloodshed, Anutin spoke about the imperative to harmonize regional maps to permanently rectify the dispute. However, he declined to take back political authority on border security, which had been devolved to the military itself, empowering the brass hats full discretion to respond to perceived affronts with deadly force. &ldquo;Every move we would sit together and jointly decide, so we work as a team,&rdquo; says Anutin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to bring back any authority.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Progressive pain</strong></h2>



<p>The results were a blow to the People&rsquo;s Party, which was hoping to build on <a href="https://time.com/6310002/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-move-forward-interview-profile/" >its predecessor Move Forward Party&rsquo;s electoral success</a> in 2023, when it secured a plurality 151 legislative seats. (However, it was blocked from forming a government by the Senate and then dissolved by the Constitutional Court.) While jingoistic support for the military was Anutin&rsquo;s secret weapon, the progressive&rsquo;s antagonist view of green uniforms turned out to be its kryptonite. Despite receiving the second largest number of votes, People&rsquo;s Party leader <a href="https://time.com/7317196/thailand-natthaphong-ruengpanyawut-peoples-party-election-profile/" >Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut</a> ruled out joining Bhumjaithai in government and instead vowed to hold Anutin&rsquo;s government to account in opposition. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose hope,&rdquo; Natthaphong told tearful supporters. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come so far.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Certainly, Bhumjaithai&rsquo;s resounding victory provides grist for Anutin&rsquo;s argument that Thais are not hankering after radical reform as the progressives maintain. &ldquo;Division is actually from the media and the people who could not win,&rdquo; he told TIME. &ldquo;Rather than going back to improve themselves, they tend to blame other stuff.&rdquo;</p>



<p>However, alongside casting constituency and party ballots, Thais also voted in a referendum on whether to draft a new constitution, with preliminary tallies suggesting some 65% had voted in favor. How that new charter looks will be the next battleground, with progressives keen to amend sections on the <a href="https://time.com/6993473/thailand-2024-senate-election-results-democracy/" >establishment-stocked Senate</a> and royal prerogatives&mdash;but Anutin, in the driving seat, dead against.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Resurgent royalism</strong></h2>



<p>Other than aligning with Thailand&rsquo;s armed forces, Anutin is also close to its sacrosanct royal palace, accompanying King Maha Vajiralongkorn during a four-day visit to Bhutan in April as well as his historic visit to China in November. In 2023, the Move Forward Party campaigned on curbing royal powers, though efforts to reform <a href="https://time.com/6296556/thailand-lese-majeste-reform-teen-crop-top/" >Thailand&rsquo;s draconian royal defamation law</a>, known as <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> or Article 112, were deemed unconstitutional and led to the party&rsquo;s dissolution by the Constitutional Court.</p>



<p>As such, the People&rsquo;s Party was <a href="https://time.com/7372530/thailand-election-lese-majeste-article-112-peoples-party-lookkate-bhumjaithai" >forced to sidestep this keystone issue in its latest campaign</a>. With the openly royalist Anutin receiving a strong mandate, you can expect efforts to curb royal powers to remain firmly on the backburner. Asked about his relationship with King Vajiralongkorn, Anutin told TIME: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare have a relationship with any royal family member, but I&rsquo;m his humble servant.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>It&rsquo;s the economy, buffalo!</strong></h2>



<p>Thailand is already being branded the new &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nationthailand.com/news/general/40062291#:~:text=Thailand%20is%20increasingly%20being%20labelled,calls%20for%20deeper%20structural%20reform."  target="_blank">sick man of Asia</a>&rdquo; following years of torpid growth owed in large part to relentless political turmoil. (Its economy expanded by only 1.5% last year.) Anutin hopes that his resounding mandate can at least provide a modicum of stability while he enacts his pro-business agenda. He advocates creating new jobs by promoting industries from emerging global growth sectors, such as electric vehicles, medical and wellness services, bio-technology, and the digital economy.</p>



<p>But economists warn more structural reform is required to truly arrest Thailand&rsquo;s economic tailspin. This includes breaking up the monopolies&mdash;family-linked conglomerates dominate key sectors such as energy, retail, telecommunications, and food, with the top 5% of companies controlling over 85% of total revenue&mdash;something Anutin told TIME he is determined to tackle. But with such action against the interests of his elite backers, only time will tell whether he will truly walk the talk. &ldquo;Structural reform is never painless&mdash;but postponing it is far more costly,&rdquo; he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Thailand to keep international balance act</strong></h2>



<p>Thailand is America&rsquo;s oldest ally in Asia while also boasts a thriving ethnically Chinese diaspora, including Anutin, whose ancestors hail from Guangdong province. However, Anutin also spent eight years studying and working in New York and feels a great affinity for the U.S. He says that Thailand refuses to take sides in this new era of Great Power competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We consistently stand by the rules-based international order and the norms agreed upon by the global community,&rdquo; he told TIME. &ldquo;In a polarized world, countries that remain pragmatic and reliable become more valuable, not less.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Anutin also wants to play a role within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to bring a lasting peace to war-ravaged neighbor Myanmar, whose ruling junta recently underwent its own <a href="https://time.com/7357323/myanmar-election-junta-burma-explainer/" >election that has been widely condemned as a sham</a>. &ldquo;Engagement does not mean endorsement,&rdquo; Anutin says. &ldquo;We work with all sides to reduce suffering and support ASEAN-led solutions. Thailand prioritizes humanitarian access, regional stability, and the safety of civilians. While ASEAN has a non-interference policy, violence against civilians is a clear moral boundary.&rdquo;</p>

<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7372956"></div></div>

<p>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made history once again after leading her party to a landslide victory in a general election on Sunday&mdash;a result that could significantly alter the country&rsquo;s relationship with China and lead to deep domestic economic reforms.&nbsp;</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7346495/japan-sanae-takaichi-snap-election-ldp/" >decision to hold a snap election</a> just months after her <a href="https://time.com/7327260/japan-prime-minister-sanae-takaichi-ldp-coalition-komeito-ishin-analysis/" >glass-breaking rise to power</a> paid off as her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secured 316 of the 465 seats in the parliament&rsquo;s lower house&mdash;enough to form a supermajority and a dramatic increase from the LDP and its coalition partner&rsquo;s joint 232 seats before the election.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I wanted the voters to give me a mandate because I advocated for responsible, proactive fiscal policy that would significantly shift economic and fiscal policy,&rdquo; Takaichi <a href="https://news.web.nhk/newsweb/na/na-k10015046831000"  target="_blank">told public broadcaster NHK</a> late Sunday.</p>



<p>Takaichi, who just a few months ago became <a href="https://time.com/7323329/sanae-takaichi-japan-prime-minister/" >Japan&rsquo;s first female Prime Minister</a> after her predecessor Shigeru Ishiba <a href="https://time.com/7315284/shigeru-ishiba-japan-prime-minister-resignation-ldp-future-analysis-explainer/" >resigned</a> as head of the LDP amid waning support for the long-ruling party, has now presided over the LDP&rsquo;s biggest electoral victory since its 1955 founding, surpassing the previous record-holding 300 lower house seats won during former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone&rsquo;s Administration in 1986.</p>



<p>Even though Japan wasn&rsquo;t due for another general election until late 2028, Takaichi called the election in hopes of capitalizing on high public approval ratings during her early tenure to gain a mandate and the legislative strength to introduce her sweeping conservative agenda.</p>



<p>Experts tell TIME that the LDP&rsquo;s election success leaned heavily on Takaichi&rsquo;s brand of leadership. Standing out for her dynamism in a party previously dominated by older men, her pledge to &ldquo;work, work, work&rdquo; on behalf of the country, as well as a strong social media campaign, won over disillusioned young voters.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This was a very personal campaign,&rdquo; says Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University&rsquo;s Japan campus. &ldquo;It was all about Takaichi, and they looked at her, and they looked at the other potential leaders and found them wanting.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Takaichi campaigned on a tougher stance toward China, rebuilding Japan&#8217;s military, tougher immigration rules, and economic reforms. She also earned the &ldquo;<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116019257556623305"  target="_blank">complete and total endorsement</a>&rdquo; of U.S. President Donald Trump, with whom she has <a href="https://time.com/7328829/sanae-takaichi-donald-trump-japan-us-trade-defense-ishiba-abe/" >established a strong working relationship</a>.</p>



<p>Trump congratulated Takaichi on her &ldquo;LANDSLIDE Victory&rdquo; in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116037545036564953"  target="_blank">post</a> on Truth Social on Sunday.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know about what comes next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A loyal legislature</p>



<p>Kingston says the LDP&rsquo;s success, buttressed by an additional 36 seats won by its coalition partner Japan Innovation Party, effectively allows Takaichi to pursue whatever policies she wants. &ldquo;The opposition has been decimated,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s really no guardrails out there.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan, adds that many of the LDP&rsquo;s new victors, including some who lost their seats in 2024, are now effectively Takaichi&rsquo;s &ldquo;children.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll look to her&nbsp; &ldquo;for protection,&rdquo; he says, and they&rsquo;ll be expected to &ldquo;support their political mom.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Change in Japan-China relations</h2>



<p>Experts say that the LDP&rsquo;s resounding win signals an end for now to Japan&rsquo;s &ldquo;revolving-door&rdquo; politics. And with Takaichi presumed to have years remaining in power, China will have to navigate the increasingly tense relationship her early Administration has already exhibited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly after taking office, Takaichi made waves by publicly stating that Japan might respond to an invasion of Taiwan, noting that such an invasion could trigger collective self-defense and a &ldquo;survival-threatening situation.&rdquo; She has also said she would bolster Japan&rsquo;s military, further eroding decades of pacifist policy that began after World War II.</p>



<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s comments <a href="https://time.com/7334371/china-japan-taiwan-takaichi-explainer/" >provoked the ire of China</a>, which views Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing has responded with attempts to isolate Japan, telling Chinese tourists to &ldquo;avoid traveling&rdquo; there in the near future and reimposing a ban on Japanese seafood imports.</p>

<p>But domestically, while opponents have criticized her hawkishness, nationalists have cheered Takaichi&rsquo;s unwillingness to cower to China&rsquo;s pressure campaign.</p>



<p>&ldquo;China initially assumed she would be a short-lived leader, based on recent past,&rdquo; Kingston says. &ldquo;They ratcheted up the wolf-warrior diplomacy, denounced her, vilified her, and demanded she retract. And what they did is inadvertently boost her popularity among the Japanese, because people rallied behind her against the regional bully.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s President Lai Ching-te, meanwhile, was among the first foreign leaders to congratulate Takaichi,<a href="https://x.com/ChingteLai/status/2020502553675669884"  target="_blank"> saying on X</a> that he looks forward to facing &ldquo;regional challenges together in the spirit of shared values and mutually beneficial cooperation, thereby promoting peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.&rdquo; And in his congratulatory post, Trump praised Takaichi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peace Through Strength Agenda.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Economic reforms</strong></h2>



<p>Domestically, Takaichi, who counts former conservative U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her political hero, has pledged drastic economic reforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is a plan to suspend the 8% consumption tax on food to ease the burden of rising prices on households.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We will accelerate talks over a sales tax reduction,&rdquo; Takaichi told reporters in the aftermath of the election on Sunday.</p>



<p>Takaichi also promised partial tax deductions for babysitting expenses and corporate tax incentives for companies that offer in-house childcare&mdash;a sign that she may be warming to more family-friendly policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We will prioritise the sustainability of fiscal policy. We will ensure necessary investments. Public and private sectors must invest. We will build a strong and resilient economy,&rdquo; she said Sunday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Constitutional amendment</strong></h2>



<p>Takaichi may try to use her sweeping political mandate to push through structural change. The LDP has long sought to revise Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which establishes Japan&rsquo;s pacifist approach to conflict and dispute resolution and prohibits the maintenance of air, ground, and maritime military forces.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we write the Self-Defense Forces into the Constitution?&rdquo; Takaichi said in a Feb. 2 speech. &ldquo;I want you to let us revise the Constitution to position them as an effective organization.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But while the party now has a supermajority in the lower house, it doesn&rsquo;t have the same in the upper house. And amending the constitution would be an uphill battle, requiring support from two-thirds of lawmakers in both chambers as well as a public referendum.</p>



<p>Stephen Nagy, a professor of international relations at the International Christian University in Tokyo and a visiting fellow with the Japan Institute for International Affairs, says that Takaichi &ldquo;might be misreading the mandate if she focuses on constitutional revision.&rdquo; He believes that many of the people who backed her did so with inflation, cost of living, affordability and wages top of mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gender politics</strong></h2>



<p>Though Takaichi made history as the country&rsquo;s first female Prime Minister in October 2025, her stance on gender and sexuality politics has prompted mixed reactions to her rise.</p>



<p>Takaichi supports the imperial family&rsquo;s male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage as well as amending the 19th-century law requiring married couples to have the same surname, under which most women are pressured into abandoning theirs. While there is growing support in Japan for couples to be able to have different surnames, Takaichi<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55472446"  target="_blank"> said</a> the practice &ldquo;may destroy the social structure based on family units.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t have a very positive track record on gender issues, on family-friendly policies, women&rsquo;s empowerment,&rdquo; Kingston <a href="https://time.com/7322887/japan-sanae-takaichi-ldp-leader-election-first-female-prime-minister/" >told TIME last year</a>.</p>

<p>Karin and Laura Kildow, <a href="https://time.com/7328290/lindsey-vonn-olympics-comeback-interview/" >Lindsey Vonn&rsquo;s </a>younger sisters, held hands before their older sibling entered the starting gate at the Olympic women&rsquo;s downhill competition in Cortina d&rsquo;Ampezzo, Italy, on Sunday. Along with the rest of the world, they awaited to see if she could pull off the impossible: win an Olympic medal, maybe even a gold, at 41, following not only knee replacement surgery on her right knee, but a <a href="https://time.com/7366530/can-you-ski-with-a-torn-acl-lindsey-vonn/" >ruptured ACL </a>in her left one, which she suffered in a downhill crash a little more than a week ago. Repeat: a week ago. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>On<a href="https://time.com/7368808/super-bowl-2026-seahawks-patriots/" > Super Bowl Sunday,</a> this high-speed downhill&mdash;already the most prestigious race in all of skiing&mdash;had become a sort of Super Bowl stand-in at these Olympics. In the second row, Karin wore a black cowboy hat and a Team USA jacket. Laura wore a blue USA beanie. Karin&rsquo;s left hand clutched Laura&rsquo;s right one. Karin closed her eyes, and took a deep breath.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their father, Alan Kildow, stood upright by their side. They all knew the risks of this Olympic run, of Vonn&rsquo;s determination to finish her comeback. Vonn took deep breaths too, and jumped out of the gate, but some 13 seconds into her race, her arm clipped a gate, and she spun and tumbled hard down the course. Karin screamed in horror, and bowed her head. Laura recoiled, and closed her eyes. Alan crossed his arms, stoic for the moment. Soon afterwards, he reached under the left lens of his sunglasses, seeming to wipe away a tear. He bit his bottom lip.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7328290/lindsey-vonn-olympics-comeback-interview/" ><em>Inside Lindsey Vonn&rsquo;s Unprecedented Attempt at an Olympic Comeback</em></a></p>



<p>The venue went eerily silent, except for the completely incongruous dance music playing over a loudspeaker. Couldn&rsquo;t someone make that stop? About a half-dozen emergency personnel attended to Vonn on the mountain. She appeared to clutch her left knee. She screamed. Some ten minutes later, a yellow helicopter flew over the mountain. Vonn was airlifted off the course. The crowd waved to Vonn as she was taken away.</p>



<p>On their way out of the venue, Karin and Laura stopped to take some pictures and exchange words with <a href="https://time.com/7277168/snoop-dogg-interview-time100-2025/" >Snoop Dogg</a>, who was in Cortina in his capacity as NBC roving correspondent. Snoop was wearing a Vonn shirt. Under the stands, Karin and Laura joined a few other people for a group hug. &ldquo;I will say that Snoop Dogg really picked me up,&rdquo; Laura told TIME moments later. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Stay strong for Lindsey.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s helping me right now. It looked really bad, but I&#8217;m glad that we&#8217;re all here.&rdquo; Karin cited <a href="https://www.worldfuturefund.org/Documents/maninarena.htm"  target="_blank">&ldquo;Man In The Arena,&rdquo; </a>the famous Teddy Roosevelt speech. &ldquo;The people who dare greatly are the ones that should be admired, and she dared greatly,&rdquo; Karin tells TIME through tears. &ldquo;She dared greatly. She put it all on the line.&rdquo; In a statement, U.S. Ski and Snowboard said Vonn had &#8220;sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AP26039459022292.jpg" alt="Milan Cortina Olympics Alpine Skiing" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>For Vonn&rsquo;s immediate family&mdash;her mother, Linda Anne Krohn, died of ALS in 2022&mdash;the clear, beautiful morning in Italy&rsquo;s Dolomites mountain range started out with so much hope. Vonn loved racing in Cortina, and the prospect of finishing her Olympic career in this beloved location was an impetus for her comeback. Before Vonn&rsquo;s Olympic race, Karin told TIME she had been sick to her stomach the previous few days. Her worry made her cry.&nbsp; But she was calm now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Vonn injured her knee at the final World Cup downhill before the Olympics, Karin had reminded her older sister that she did not <em>have</em> to compete in the Games. After all, her outstanding results on the World Cup circuit this season&mdash;two race wins, four more podiums&mdash;already certified her status as an all-time great athlete. Only a fool would question a decision to skip the Games to preserve her health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Never, ever say that to me again,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Karin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alan did his yoga and meditation the morning of the race, and wanted to make a point in a pre-race conversation with TIME. He lives in Vail, Colo., and many older people have been coming up to him in recent weeks, telling him that Vonn&rsquo;s comeback has inspired them on their own quests for athletic longevity, even if only on a recreational level. What she was doing transcended skiing.</p>



<p>Lindsey texted her father that morning, telling him she&rsquo;s got this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the crash, as Alan was about to make his own exit, he was asked if he wanted to share any thoughts. Maybe later, he said. First, he wanted to check up on his daughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s pretty badly hurt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2257586701.jpg" alt="U.S. President Trump Attends World Economic Forum In Davos"/>



<p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7357067/trump-gaza-board-of-peace-members-davos/" >Board of Peace</a> is set to hold its long-awaited first meeting on February 19, where it will discuss the next stage of a ceasefire in Gaza and fundraising for the reconstruction of the destroyed territory. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Trump unveiled his plan for the board at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. Its initial members include the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, Pakistan, Turkey, Hungary, Morocco, Kosovo, Albania, Bulgaria, Argentina, Paraguay, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>



<p>But many close U.S. allies balked at joining the board, fearing it would undermine the United Nations (U.N.) and amid reports that permanent membership would be granted to member states that contribute $1 billion in cash within the first year.</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7357067/trump-gaza-board-of-peace-members-davos/" ><em>Trump Unveils Gaza &lsquo;Board of Peace&rsquo; at Davos and Lauds Overseas Accomplishments</em></a></p>



<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is open to contributing $1 billion to the Board of Peace, but argued it would require the release of Russian assets in the U.S. that were frozen during the Biden Administration.</p>



<p>Trump is set to chair the board, while son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will both serve on an &ldquo;Executive Board&rdquo; with Trump&rsquo;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, president of the World Bank Group Ajay Banga, national security adviser Robert Gabriel, and Marc Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management, one of the biggest U.S. private equity firms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gaza reconstruction&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>This board&rsquo;s first meeting will be held at the Institute of Peace and will focus on fundraising for Gaza&#8217;s reconstruction, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/07/gaza-board-peace-meeting-trump-dc"  target="_blank">Axios</a>, which first reported the news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.N. Security Council has authorized the Board to oversee the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire and work on governance and reconstruction.</p>



<p>The Board will meet as the ceasefire in Gaza appears shakier than ever.</p>



<p>On February 4, Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 24 Palestinians, most of them women and children, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-rafah-hamas-israel-war-2-4-2026-a3726ab659321430bf3ca73cae50936e"  target="_blank">according to Associated Press</a>, as Israel claimed it was responding to a militant attack on its soldiers that seriously wounded one.</p>



<p>According to Gaza&rsquo;s health ministry, more than 550 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since the <a href="https://time.com/7327675/trump-israel-gaza-deal-interview/" >ceasefire deal</a> brokered by Trump and mediated by Turkey, Qatar and Egypt came into effect on Oct. 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his troops will only fully withdraw from Gaza once Hamas lays down arms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Netanyahu to meet Trump </h2>



<p>Israeli officials say Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Trump at the White House on February 18, a day before the planned first meeting, but insist the meeting will focus on Iran.</p>



<p>If Netanyahu does attend the Board of Peace meeting, it will be the first time he has met Arab leaders since before the Oct. 7 attacks and the war in Gaza.</p>



<p>It is unclear who on the board will attend the first meeting, but Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said at a campaign event in Szombathely, Hungary, on Saturday that he would be there.</p>



<p>It comes at a time when Trump&rsquo;s relationship with European allies is <a href="https://time.com/7372884/jd-vance-booed-olympics-europe/" >shaky</a> after months of threats to <a href="https://time.com/7368798/trump-greenland-pursuit/" >annex Greenland</a>, but Orban is one of <a href="https://time.com/7332003/viktor-orban-donald-trumps-independence/" >Trump&rsquo;s closest allies</a> on the continent.</p>



<p>Orban, who has led Hungary for 14 years, shares Trump&rsquo;s hardline anti-immigration views.&nbsp;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260287389.jpg" alt="Opening Ceremony - Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics: Day 0"/>



<p>Olympic opening ceremonies are traditionally unifying, non-political events&mdash;a chance for athletes from around the world to introduce their national teams before the competition begins.</p>



[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>But when Vice President J.D. Vance appeared on the stadium&rsquo;s big screen during the kickoff of the <a href="https://time.com/7326904/milan-cortina-winter-2026-olympics/" >Milan Cortina</a> 2026 Winter Games on Friday, the unmistakable sound of boos and jeers broke out among the crowd of 65,000 people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While President Donald Trump seemed to brush off the reaction, telling reporters on Air Force One, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s surprising because people like him&hellip;He doesn&rsquo;t get booed in this country,&rdquo; recent polls suggest that it&rsquo;s not just Vance who has a problem in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7372855/olympics-opening-ceremony-2026-review/" ><em>Milan Cortina&rsquo;s Painfully Long Olympics Opening Ceremony Was a Defiantly Analog Celebration of Humanity</em></a></p>



<p>A new <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/54045-where-do-western-europeans-stand-on-europes-relationship-with-the-usa"  target="_blank">YouGov poll</a> released Feb. 6 found that favorable views of the U.S. among Western European nations have fallen sharply since Trump&#8217;s return to office, following the President&#8217;s aggressive attempts to annex <a href="https://time.com/7368798/trump-greenland-pursuit/" >Greenland</a>, his Administration&rsquo;s ongoing trade war with most of its European allies, and a years-long divide over the future of NATO and European security. </p>



<p>Perhaps predictably, the biggest impact was seen in Denmark. Some 84% of Danes now hold an unfavourable view of the U.S., compared with an average of 36% during former President Joe Biden&rsquo;s term. Only 26% of Danes view the U.S. as an ally or friendly nation, compared with 80% in July 2023.</p>



<p>The same trend is seen across Western Europe, in countries that were once considered U.S. allies. In Spain, only 39% of people see the U.S. as a friend or ally today, down from 73% in 2023. In Germany, the number is 41%, down from 70%; in Britain, 46%, down from 69%; in France, 53%, down from 64%; and in Italy, 52%, down from 61%.</p>



<p>A closer look at the data shows that Europeans&rsquo; views of the United States are strongly influenced by their views of Trump. A January poll by <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/54019-how-popular-is-donald-trump-in-europe-january-2026"  target="_blank">YouGov</a> found that, in Britain, 81% of people held an unfavorable opinion of President Trump; in France, 75%; in Germany, 84%; and in Denmark, 94%. </p>



<p>That shift has coincided with a change in U.S. policy toward Europe. Early in Trump&rsquo;s second term, it became clear that the Administration would treat Europe differently from its predecessors, and that Vance would be a leading critic of European policies. In an antagonistic speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025, Vance criticized European nations for their policies on free speech and argued that the continent&#8217;s gravest danger was not Russia or China, but their own governments, which he deemed overly restrictive of free speech. The Trump Administration diverged from European allies on the war in Ukraine, trade, and immigration, too. </p>



<p>The strain between the U.S. and Europe was heightened in recent months as Trump increased his efforts to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Trump refused to rule out military action to take control of the island, the United States&rsquo; NATO allies warned such an action would mean the death of the alliance. When troops from Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the Netherlands participated in joint military exercises with Denmark on the island, Trump responded by imposing tariffs on all participating countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He eventually removed the tariffs after reaching a &ldquo;<a href="https://time.com/7355850/trump-greenland-deal-tariffs-davos/" >framework agreement</a>&rdquo; with NATO regarding the island&#8217;s future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Peter-Mandelson-Prince-Andrew-Epstein-01.jpg" alt="Peter Mandelson and former Prince Andrew"/>



<p>Britain&rsquo;s government found itself at the centre of a potentially fatal political storm this week, following the latest <a href="https://time.com/7362445/epstein-files-million-pages-trump-department-justice/" >release of files</a> connected to U.S. investigations into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>



<p>Disclosures from the Epstein investigation have already rocked one British institution&mdash;the country&rsquo;s monarchy&mdash;with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, stripped of his royal title late last year. The younger brother of King Charles III, he now faces renewed calls for accountability following the U.S. Justice Department&rsquo;s release of more than 3 million Epstein-related files last week.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>But news in the country over the past few days has been dominated by the way the fallout has spread to 10 Downing Street, the official residence of Britain&rsquo;s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is struggling to quell a controversy centered on his former ambassador to Washington D.C., Peter Mandelson.</p>



<p>A major figure in Starmer&rsquo;s ruling Labour Party, <a href="https://time.com/7316349/peter-mandelson-fired-uk-ambassador-united-states-epstein-controversy/" >Mandelson was sacked as ambassador</a> in September following disclosures about a closer than previously known relationship with Epstein, who <a href="https://time.com/5649271/jeffrey-epstein-suicide/" >died in his New York prison cell</a> in 2019. The latest batch of emails go further, as it appears Mandelson might have leaked sensitive government information to Epstein in 2009. If proven to be true, it could result in him being prosecuted by British authorities.</p>



<p>That he was named ambassador at all, meanwhile, is threatening Starmer&rsquo;s premiership. Previously forced to resign from ministerial positions in 1998 and then again in 2001, Mandelson&rsquo;s relationship with Epstein was known when Starmer dispatched him to the U.S. </p>



<p>&ldquo;The truth has to come out. That&#8217;s the only way we maintain our credibility and regain trust,&rdquo; Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a lawmaker from Starmer&rsquo;s Labour Party, tells TIME. </p>



<p>The controversy has spiralled into &ldquo;one of the most significant scandals&rdquo; the Labour Party has faced in recent history.</p>



<p>&ldquo;MPs [Members of Parliament] are really disappointed that we have wasted this much political capital on keeping this one man [Mandelson] in the job. I think [the public] will feel betrayed by us for not doing what we say that we do, which is, believe women, and stand up for those who are the survivors of sexual abuse,&rdquo; she adds.</p>



<hr/>



<p>At the heart of the latest scandal are disclosures connected to Mandelson&rsquo;s time under former Prime Minister Gordon Brown from 2008-2010.</p>



<p>Serving as Business Secretary, he was a key figure during the financial crisis, privy to top secret economic plans and policies&mdash;some of which he may have passed on to the late sex offender, according to the latest batch of the Epstein files.</p>



<p>In one recently released <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02433147.pdf"  target="_blank">email</a>, for instance, he appeared to tell Epstein he would lobby other government officials in an effort to reduce a tax on bankers&rsquo; bonuses. In <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00775718.pdf"  target="_blank">another</a>, he appears to have forwarded an internal government report to Epstein which showed ways the U.K. might raise funds after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>



<p>Mandelson also appears to have tipped off Epstein that Brown would be <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02425523.pdf"  target="_blank">resigning in</a> 2010, and that the E.U. would <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02425165.pdf"  target="_blank">announce</a> a &euro;500 billion to stem the Greek debt crisis.</p>



<p>&ldquo;An initial review of the documents released in relation to Jeffrey Epstein by the U.S. Department of Justice has found that they contain likely market sensitive information surrounding the 2008 financial crash and official activities thereafter to stabilise the economy,&rdquo; said a spokesperson for Starmer earlier this week. &ldquo;Only people operating in an official capacity had access to this information in strict handling conditions to ensure it was not available to anyone who could potentially benefit from it financially.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Beyond the sharing of confidential information, the Epstein files also appear to show financial <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01487808.pdf"  target="_blank">transfers</a> totalling $75,000 from the late sex offender to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Mandelson has <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/pressure-grows-on-mandelson-to-testify-over-epstein-as-peer-is-told-this-is-the-end-13501842"  target="_blank">reportedly</a> said that he doesn&rsquo;t recall receiving the money and will need to look into whether the documents are legitimate.</p>



<p>TIME has contacted Mandelson for further comment.</p>



<p>Amid the accumulating accusations, the U.K.&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/investigation-launched-into-alleged-misconduct-in-public-office-505806"  target="_blank">confirmed</a> it has &ldquo;launched an investigation into a 72-year-old man, a former government minister, for misconduct in public office offences.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In an update on Friday afternoon, local time, police <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/update-on-investigation-into-misconduct-in-public-office-offences-505940"  target="_blank">revealed</a> two properties linked to Mandelson had been searched in relation to the probe. Mandelson has not yet &ldquo;been arrested and enquiries are ongoing,&rdquo; the police said.</p>



<p>While those inquiries unfold, the political toll is already mounting. Long regarded as a key architect of the Labour&rsquo;s electoral comeback in the 90s, Mandelson has resigned from the party, saying that he wanted to avoid causing it &ldquo;further embarrassment.&rdquo; </p>



<p>And he&rsquo;s also quit the House of Lords, relinquishing his powers as a lawmaker by leaving the upper chamber of the British Parliament. He does however retain the title of Lord&mdash;something that can only be taken away from him by the passing of a new law.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A shaken government</strong></h2>



<p>Starmer, who publicly apologized to Epstein&rsquo;s victims on Thursday, has explained Mandelson&rsquo;s appointment as ambassador in February 2025 by saying that he had &ldquo;lied repeatedly&rdquo; about his ties to Epstein. &ldquo;I regret appointing him. If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government,&rdquo; the Prime Minister said, attempting to distance himself&mdash;and his premiership&mdash;from the worsening scandal around Mandelson.</p>



<p>Yet as politicians from his own camp and that of the opposition Conservative Party clamour for answers, it is unclear whether he will succeed.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s had the potential to engulf this government in a way that I don&#8217;t think any other scandal has in its very young two years,&rdquo; Clive Lewis, another lawmaker from Starmer&rsquo;s ruling Labour Party tells TIME. &ldquo;Frankly, it&#8217;s disastrous.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d like to see those who have betrayed this country, betrayed our party, betrayed our movement, to face the full force of the legal system and the law,&rdquo; says Lewis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A splintered royal family</strong></h2>



<p>As the Mandelson scandal shook Parliament, meanwhile, tremors from the Epstein files once again reached the British royal family.</p>



<p>Documents released by the DOJ <a href="https://time.com/7362936/epstein-files-india-slovakia/" >last week</a> included a photograph of Andrew leaning over a woman on the floor. The woman&rsquo;s face had been redacted and it&rsquo;s unclear when or where the photographs were taken. The photograph has sparked renewed questions over Andrew&rsquo;s relationship with Epstein and his own conduct.</p>



<p>Police are also reviewing a fresh allegation that Epstein sent a woman to Andrew at the Royal Lodge residence in Windsor in 2010.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are aware of reports about a woman said to have been taken to an address in Windsor in 2010 for sexual purposes,&rdquo; a Thames Valley Police spokesperson told TIME on Wednesday. &ldquo;We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Andrew&rsquo;s relationship with Epstein, something which he said he <a href="https://time.com/5731244/prince-andrew-interview-epstein" >did not regret</a> after the sex offender&rsquo;s death, has long been scrutinized. The royal was famously <a href="https://time.com/6963952/scoop-netflix-true-story/" >interviewed on BBC&rsquo;s <em>Newsnight</em></a> in 2019 about the nature of the friendship.</p>



<p>Andrew was accused of sexual abuse himself by one of Epstein&rsquo;s victims, the late Virginia Giuffre. He has repeatedly denied the allegations. In 2022, <a href="https://time.com/6149123/prince-andrew-settlement-virginia-giuffre-royal-finances/" >Andrew settled a sexual abuse lawsuit</a> with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount.</p>



<p>A month before the settlement, Andrew was stripped of his key military titles and royal patronages. He was stripped of the remainder of his titles in late 2025, after additional allegations by Giuffre came to light in her <a href="https://time.com/7326183/epstein-victim-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-memoir/" >posthumous memoir</a>.</p>



<p>This week, Andrew&rsquo;s younger brother Prince Edward was asked about the release of the new files during a summit in Dubai. Offering a rare royal comment, he said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really important, always, to remember the victims, and who are the victims in all of this? [There are] a lot of victims in this.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Edward&rsquo;s remarks are &ldquo;significant&rdquo; and &ldquo;may well be the precursor to other members of the royal family making comments that we didn&#8217;t expect,&rdquo; says royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Bear in mind that various royal palaces have been mentioned in emails. It&#8217;s embarrassing, because when this occurred, he was a senior working royal,&rdquo; Fitzwilliams adds. &ldquo;It is another nail in the reputational coffin.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In a notable escalation, Starmer has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-ex-prince-andrew-should-testify-before-congress-over-epstein-2026-01-31/"  target="_blank">called</a> on Andrew to testify in front of Congress over his links to Epstein, and other lawmakers are also demanding that the royal answer serious questions.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s a reminder that no one, however powerful they are, should be above the law and no one should be allowed to evade proper justice,&rdquo; says Richard Burgon, a Labour lawmaker.</p>



<p>In agreement, Labour&rsquo;s Ribeiro-Addy notes: &ldquo;There&#8217;s absolutely no excuse for anybody, regardless of their rank or their position, to have maintained relations with such a monster.&rdquo;</p>



<p>TIME has reached out to Andrew&rsquo;s representatives for comment.</p>

<p>Chonthicha &ldquo;Lookkate&rdquo; Jangrew was nervous as she walked around a market in Chunphon, a southern province of Thailand that is politically conservative and royalist, in January campaigning for the progressive People&rsquo;s Party.</p>



<p>Lookkate, a pro-democracy activist and member of parliament who was named one of <a href="https://time.com/collections/next-generation-leaders/6973235/chonthicha-lookkate-jangrew/" >TIME&rsquo;s Next Generation Leaders in 2024</a>, was used to sticking her neck out&mdash;and to being penalized for it. Prior to becoming a member of parliament after elections in 2023, she had been prosecuted in around 30 criminal cases on charges that human rights organizations call politically motivated. But since being charged and <a href="https://time.com/6982473/chonthicha-lookkate-jangrew-move-forward-lese-majeste-conviction-sentence/" >ultimately convicted in 2024</a> with Thailand&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6296556/thailand-lese-majeste-reform-teen-crop-top/" ><em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law</a>, which bans speech deemed anti-monarchy, she has feared not only losing her freedom but losing amity with her fellow citizens.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>A food seller, a man in his 40s, gestured to Lookkate. He recognized her, but to her surprise, he wished her luck with the outcome of her case and gave her a hug.</p>



<p>Lookkate hopes there are others in Thailand who will back <a href="https://time.com/7317196/thailand-natthaphong-ruengpanyawut-peoples-party-election-profile/" >those sticking their neck out</a> like her in the approaching Feb. 8 general election. But it&rsquo;s a far different political landscape than the last general election in 2023 when Lookkate&rsquo;s progressive Move Forward Party&mdash;the predecessor of the People&rsquo;s Party&mdash;<a href="https://time.com/6279758/thailand-elections-move-forward-party-pheu-thai/" >emerged the biggest winner</a> only to be <a href="https://time.com/6307115/thailand-prime-minister-srettha-thavisin-pheu-thai/" >thwarted by establishment forces from forming the government</a>. At the time, the party <a href="https://time.com/6310002/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-move-forward-interview-profile/" >campaigned</a> on amending the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law, energizing voters who had participated in or witnessed the <a href="https://time.com/5880105/thailand-protests-monarchy/" >sweeping 2020 and 2021 youth-led pro-democracy protests</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/chonthicha.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Now, there is no mention of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> on the <a href="https://election69.peoplesparty.or.th/policy/"  target="_blank">party&rsquo;s platform</a> or its social media.</p>



<p>At stake in the election is whether the government can revive Thailand&rsquo;s faltering economy and restore public trust, especially after a tumultuous year marked by a <a href="https://time.com/7272563/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-impact-photos/" >powerful earthquake</a>, massive floods, fatal building and construction crane collapses, <a href="https://time.com/7305413/thailand-cambodia-border-war-hun-sen-manet-paetongtarn-thaksin-shinawatra/" >border clashes with Cambodia</a>, and political upheaval as Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul <a href="https://time.com/7314811/anutin-charnvirakul-thailand-prime-minister-bhumjaithai-pheu-thai-peoples-party/" >took office in September</a> following the <a href="https://time.com/7313316/thailand-paetongtarn-shinawatra-prime-minister-removed-constitutional-court-verdict-pheu-thai/" >dismissal of Paetongtarn Shinawatra</a> over ethical misconduct. But it will also determine whether the public gives its mandate to a conservative royalist coalition government led by Anutin&rsquo;s Bhumjaithai Party or demonstrates that, even after years of the government and judiciary cracking down on dissent, many Thais still yearn for a new, more democratic direction.</p>



<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/7364304/thailand-prime-minister-anutin-charnvirakul-election/" ><em>&lsquo;I Never Fail the People&rsquo;: Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul Doesn&rsquo;t Plan on Going Anywhere</em></a></p>



<p>&ldquo;As Thais go to the polls this Sunday, at issue will be whether Thailand will break out from its pattern of political instability and economic underperformance over the past two decades,&rdquo; Thitinan Pongsudhirak, professor and senior fellow of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University, tells TIME. &ldquo;The signs and signals suggest not, at least not for a while yet.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For the Thai people, the stakes of the election are also &ldquo;rooted in the survival of political hope,&rdquo; says Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a professor at Kyoto University&rsquo;s Center for Southeast Asian Studies. &ldquo;This election is a test of whether the parliamentary path remains a viable vehicle for change.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&lsquo;The battleground for democracy&rsquo;</h2>



<p>The youth-led protests that erupted in 2020 were initially aimed at military-backed rule since the 2014 coup, but as the movement grew, protesters broadened their demands beyond elected politics to challenge the role of institutions long shielded from public criticism, including <a href="https://time.com/7298029/thailand-king-sons-vajiralongkorn-exclusive/" >the monarchy</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The three important pillars in Thai society are nation, religion, and king,&rdquo; says Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, advocacy lead at Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR). Of these, some believe the monarch is the most important. The <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law, or Article 112, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison per charge, is meant to protect the royal family from insults, defamation, and threats, but rights groups say the law has been systematically wielded to quash political dissent.</p>



<p>Experts <a href="https://time.com/6296556/thailand-lese-majeste-reform-teen-crop-top/" >previously told TIME</a> that Article 112 is more of a means to an end. It allows conservative members of Thailand&rsquo;s parliament, judiciary, and military to easily target progressive lawmakers and activists, when their real gripe may be with broader proposed reforms, like ending military conscription and implementing a minimum wage.</p>



<p>Despite emerging as the highest vote-getter of Thailand&rsquo;s 2023 general election, the Move Forward Party was unable to get the backing of the military-aligned Senate to lead the government. Instead, Pheu Thai, the second-placed party led by the politically influential Shinawatra family, partnered with conservative, royalist, and military-aligned parties to form a shaky governing coalition, leaving Move Forward to lead the opposition.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/thai-protestor.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>In August 2024, Thailand&rsquo;s Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of the Move Forward Party on the grounds that its campaign to reform the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law amounted to an attempt to overthrow the monarchy. The court&rsquo;s decision also barred the party&rsquo;s leaders and executives from holding political office or forming a new party for 10 years, effectively sidelining some of the most prominent opposition politicians from Thai politics, while what remained was reincarnated as the People&rsquo;s Party. Move Forward&rsquo;s predecessor, <a href="https://time.com/5788470/thailand-future-forward-party-disbanded/" >the Future Forward Party</a>, was similarly forced to dissolve in 2020 after the Constitutional Court ruled that it had broken electoral rules.</p>



<p>Even in its successor form as the People&rsquo;s Party, the movement has continued to be shadowed by legal cases tied to Article 112. Thailand&rsquo;s National Anti-Corruption Commission is <a href="https://www.nationthailand.com/news/politics/40060323"  target="_blank">considering</a> a vote to indict 44 former Move Forward Party lawmakers, many of whom are now members of the People&rsquo;s Party, over their prior support for amending the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law. The vote was postponed last month after the lawmakers formally filed requests for a fairness review.</p>



<p>Lookkate was charged under Article 112 in two cases: one for a speech she gave at a peaceful demonstration in September 2021, and the other for a Facebook post she made as part of pro-democracy group Free Youth&rsquo;s &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Messages campaign&rdquo; in November 2020, which included a letter she had written to then-King Rama X calling for reforms of the monarchy and the royal budget. Lookkate faces the prospect of more than four years in prison but for now remains free on bail while appealing the cases to the Supreme Court. Because she was granted bail, Lookkate has been able to retain her parliamentary seat. But if she is imprisoned, she will be disqualified from serving as a member of parliament under Thai law.</p>



<p>Lookkate is far from the only target under Article 112. Activists say that broad enforcement of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> has ramped up since the youth-led pro-democracy protests in 2020, particularly under the current government. Between Nov. 19, 2020, and Sept. 1, 2025, 284 people, including 20 minors, have been charged under Article 112, according to TLHR. By the end of September, 12 were serving prison sentences, and 18 were still detained pending trial or appeal.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The battleground for democracy a few years ago was on the street. People took to the streets, they protested, they made their demands clear to the establishment. Today, the battleground for democracy is in the courtroom,&rdquo; says Akarachai. &ldquo;People who took to the streets now find themselves in the courtroom, their fate in the hands of judges.&rdquo;</p>



<p>TIME has reached out to the Thai Constitutional Court, Election Commission, and Attorney General&rsquo;s Office for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&lsquo;The <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> universe was expanding&rsquo;</h2>



<p>Last April, Paul Chambers was jammed into the back of what seemed like a cattle truck, along with around 50 other people who, like him, were handcuffed. Chambers, an American academic who had built a career and family in Thailand across 30 years, was told that he was being charged under Article 112. Chambers later learnt that the charge stemmed from an unpublished webinar blurb about Thai military reshuffles, not direct criticism of the monarchy.</p>



<p>The truck brought them from the Provincial Court to the Phitsanulok prison, where, one by one, the people were unloaded, their handcuffs removed, and their clothing stripped and changed into a uniform. Chambers was ushered into a concrete room that felt overcrowded and cramped. Each person was given a small towel to lie on, Chambers says, and when anyone needed the toilet, they would use a hole in the corner of the room.</p>



<p>When other prisoners asked him why he had been jailed, Chambers hesitated. He knew there might be nationalists and royalists in the prison and was afraid of being attacked. &ldquo;Nobody likes someone accused of 112,&rdquo; Chambers tells TIME.</p>



<p>Chambers was told he would spend five days there before being transferred to the general population, where the U.S. Embassy later said he could have been held for months. Thanks to pressure from his wife, the embassy, and his attorneys at TLHR, Chambers was transferred to another room on the second day, and late that night, he was released on bail and required to wear an ankle monitor.</p>



<p>On May 1, the charges against Chambers were dropped. But the consequences had nevertheless come swiftly: his visa was revoked, he was fired from his job at Naresuan University, and the police decided they disagreed with the regional prosecutor and would continue to pursue the case against him. Late in May, the Attorney General of Thailand dropped the charges, countermanding the police. Chambers rode in a van with his wife and an immigration police officer, followed by an immigration police car, to the airport, where the police returned him his passport and he boarded a flight back to the U.S.</p>



<p>TIME has reached out to the Phitsanulok Provincial Court and police for comment.</p>



<p>The case, Akarachai, the TLHR advocate, tells TIME, was &ldquo;a signal that the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> universe was expanding.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Paul-Chambers-1.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Chambers&rsquo; attorneys at TLHR filed an administrative lawsuit on his behalf against the police commissioner of Thailand and the immigration police seeking 3.6 million baht in damages and to restore Chambers&rsquo; visa, as he wishes to return. Chambers&rsquo; wife is still in Thailand.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to go back, and my wife is also afraid for me to go back,&rdquo; Chambers said, especially after a recent resurgence in pro-military and pro-monarchy sentiment amid the armed conflict between Thailand and Cambodia.</p>



<p>Pavin tells TIME that over the years, Article 112 has transitioned &ldquo;from a criminal statute into a tool for permanent political erasure.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Pavin has himself been charged with Article 112 and <a href="https://time.com/2971785/thailand-junta-pavin-chachavalpongpun-passport/" >related charges</a>. In 2014, after the military coup, Pavin refused to report for &ldquo;attitude adjustment&rdquo;&mdash;detention and interrogation without formal charge that critics have <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2015/09/how-thailands-military-junta-tried-to-adjust-my-attitude-in-detention/"  target="_blank">said</a> the military used to &ldquo;neutralize its critics and opponents&rdquo;&mdash;after which the state issued an arrest warrant, revoked his passport, and accused him of violating the <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> law. In the years since, Pavin has lived in exile under the threat of further <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> prosecution over his continued criticism of the Thai monarchy and for his establishment of the &ldquo;Royalist Marketplace&rdquo; Facebook group in 2020, which served as a forum for openly discussing the monarchy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/112.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>&ldquo;I am, in effect, banned from my own home&mdash;not for a procedural oversight, but for the &lsquo;crime&rsquo; of providing academic and public analysis that challenges the institution&rsquo;s sacred status,&rdquo; Pavin, who is based in Japan, says. &ldquo;The state no longer just seeks to punish dissent within its borders but aims to excommunicate critics entirely.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In recent years, Akarachai says the scope of the law has broadened beyond criticisms of the royal family to include people who have criticized previous monarchs, the abstract institution of the monarchy, and even, like Lookkate, suggested reform to the institution. Among the hundreds who have been charged since 2020, one young activist was convicted for wearing a pink traditional dress that the court said mocked the Thai Queen, another was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/world/asia/thailand-sentence-royalty-defamation.html"  target="_blank">sentenced to 50 years in prison</a> for sharing clips from John Oliver&rsquo;s <em>Last Week Tonight</em> and a BBC documentary about the Thai monarchy on Facebook, and still another was convicted for <a href="https://www.afr.com/world/asia/poodles-and-crop-tops-the-king-of-thailand-in-six-objects-20201201-p56jkt"  target="_blank">apparently mocking the king</a> by wearing a crop top at a pro-democracy protest. On May 14, 2024, youth activist Netiporn &ldquo;Bung&rdquo; Sanesangkhom <a href="https://time.com/6977775/detained-thai-activist-netiporn-bung-death-hunger-strike/" >died in custody</a> after a prolonged hunger strike, following months of pretrial detention on <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> charges.</p>



<p>According to TLHR, Article 112 is just one of a number of laws that are used in political prosecutions. Between July 2020 and October 2025, nearly 1,500 people were charged under the emergency decree which penalizes protest; 599 were charged with illegal assembly; 156 people were charged with sedition; more than 200 with the Computer Crimes Act; and 45 with contempt of court.</p>



<p>The prosecution of children has also become more prevalent, according to TLHR. At least 286 children were charged or prosecuted for their political participation between late 2020 and October 2025, including 20 children in 24 <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> cases. One child was convicted under the emergency decree for riding his bicycle to observe a protest at age 12, according to TLHR.</p>



<p>In July Thailand&rsquo;s parliament <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/politics/3070330/mps-back-amnesty-bills"  target="_blank">rejected two amnesty proposals</a>, including one from the People&rsquo;s Party, that would have effectively wiped Article 112 cases, though in October, the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.thaienquirer.com/61530/parliament-passes-amnesty-bill-excluding-lese-majeste-offenders-adds-rehabilitation-option-for-youth-under-18/"  target="_blank">passed a bill</a> proposed by the ultra-conservative, nationalist United Thai Nation Party to provide amnesty to those under 18 who committed or were accused of offences related to political assembly or expression, although it had not become law before parliament was dissolved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&lsquo;A vote against the nation&rsquo;</h2>



<p>As the general election soon approaches, polls indicate that it&rsquo;s a race between Anutin&rsquo;s Bhumjaithai, vying to remain in power, and the People&rsquo;s Party.</p>



<p>Bhumjaithai has been buoyed by nationalist fervor of the Thai-Cambodia border clash, says Thitinan. It has also capitalized on its incumbency, including by promoting loyalists to bureaucratic positions overseeing grassroots constituencies and picking up on defections from smaller parties. And Bhumjaithai has palace backing, Thitinan adds.</p>



<p>Anutin has sought to portray the People&rsquo;s Party as the party of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> reform&mdash;a move that could both scupper potential support for the progressive party among the more royalist-minded and instil fears of further political instability, given that attempted <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> reform led to the dissolution of its predecessor. Anutin <a href="https://www.thansettakij.com/politics/647496"  target="_blank">said</a> in December that his party Bhumjaithai would never join hands with the People&rsquo;s Party so long as it does not forsake the idea of amending the law. Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the royalist Democrat Party, also <a href="https://www.bangkokbiznews.com/politics/1213951"  target="_blank">said</a> that he would not work with parties that advocate for divisive policies.</p>



<p>People&rsquo;s Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut has insisted that amending Section 112 will not be on his party&rsquo;s campaign platform, which is focused on strengthening the rule of law. His party&rsquo;s goal is only to &ldquo;stand behind the people,&rdquo; he said. Since the Constitutional Court ruled in January 2024 that political parties were prohibited from campaigning on the issue of Article 112, People&rsquo;s Party leaders have largely left their once-most popular idea of amending Article 112 unmentioned.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/natthaphong.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://time.com/7364304/thailand-prime-minister-anutin-charnvirakul-election/" >interview with TIME</a>, Anutin pointed to the People&rsquo;s Party&rsquo;s abandonment of its <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> campaign&mdash;which it was legally required to do&mdash;as proof that &ldquo;demand to amend this law has significantly subsided.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Even political parties that previously sought to advance this issue have publicly stated that it is no longer part of their policy agenda,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>The absence of Article 112 from its 2026 campaign could work against the People&rsquo;s Party, <a href="https://fulcrum.sg/anutins-rise-and-the-peoples-partys-test/"  target="_blank">wrote</a> Eugene Mark, a researcher at the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, as &ldquo;a party born of defiance against the conservative establishment now depends on pragmatism for survival.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Still, says Pavin, Thailand&rsquo;s political elites and establishment, which are coalescing around Anutin&rsquo;s Bhumjaithai Party, are tying the People&rsquo;s Party to Article 112, &ldquo;framing the People&rsquo;s Party&rsquo;s reformist platform as a threat to national security&rdquo; and &ldquo;suggesting that any vote for reform is a vote against the nation itself.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Thitinan, the Thai professor, says that while the People&rsquo;s Party has been &ldquo;unable to run on deep structural reforms the way Move Forward did in 2023,&rdquo; it has nevertheless gained momentum through &ldquo;its message of fighting corruption and reforming the economy to restore stronger growth.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The strong polling for the People&rsquo;s Party&mdash;particularly among urban youth&mdash;signals a persistent, deep-seated appetite for structural change and a total rejection of military interference,&rdquo; says Pavin. &ldquo;However, the rise of Bhumjaithai in provincial heartlands reflects a parallel appetite for &lsquo;stability&rsquo; and patronage.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The popularity of Bhumjaithai may also suggest, Pavin adds, that a significant portion of voters have been persuaded that the People&rsquo;s Party&rsquo;s focus on institutional reform&mdash;including the memory of its previous incarnation&rsquo;s campaigning around Article 112 in the previous election&mdash;is &ldquo;too &lsquo;risky&rsquo; or &lsquo;radical&rsquo; during times of economic and border instability.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&lsquo;Litmus test&rsquo;</h2>



<p>Lookkate is now running for a seat as part of the People&rsquo;s Party&rsquo;s leadership, instead of in her constituency. If she ends up in prison, the party can replace her with another member, which they would not be able to do if she were the representative of a constituency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She says the party has had to be careful with their messaging and strategic in their campaign, advocating for broader judicial reform and a raft of progressive policies to address stark inequalities in the country.</p>



<p>Lookkate tells TIME the issues she&rsquo;s heard most about from voters are household debt, rising costs-of-living, entrenched business monopolies, and <a href="https://time.com/6899646/scams-trafficking-drugs-southeast-asia-golden-triangle/" >scam centers along the country&rsquo;s border</a> that have gained international attention for forced labor and human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Some people are still concerned about <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em>,&rdquo; Lookkate says, but many are afraid to speak out.</p>



<p>This election will serve as a kind of &ldquo;litmus test&rdquo; for what the public wants, says Thitinan. For many young voters, the People&rsquo;s Party &ldquo;seems to be their one and only agency.&rdquo; If the party can win more than the 151 out of 500 seats it did in 2023, that outcome &ldquo;would suggest that the electorate want a different kind of Thailand than that of the past two decades,&rdquo; he says.</p>



<p>But even if the People&rsquo;s Party comes out on top with a plurality again, it will likely also once again face the challenge of forming a governing coalition with parties that may fear fallout with the establishment, says Thitinan. Meanwhile, second-place may be good enough for Bhumjaithai, which could more easily form a coalition with Pheu Thai, another party that favors short-term populist spending over long-term economic reform.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s why the People&rsquo;s Party is aiming for an outright majority. &ldquo;We must not accept this anymore,&rdquo; Move Forward&rsquo;s former Prime Minister candidate Pita Limjaroenrat, who was barred from electoral politics from 10 years, said at a People&rsquo;s Party rally in Bangkok on Jan. 25. &ldquo;And the only way to do that is to win by a wide margin, to win big, and to keep winning for longer. We must win so decisively that the second-ranked party doesn&rsquo;t dare form a government against us.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But Thailand has gone nearly two decades without a single party winning an outright governing majority, and that&rsquo;s unlikely to change, according to polls, which have the People&rsquo;s Party leading in popularity but only at <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/6/thailand-election-2026-what-are-the-main-parties-what-do-polls-suggest"  target="_blank">about 30%</a>.</p>



<p>This election could be the decider between further entrenchment of Article 112 as &ldquo;an unassailable pillar of the state&rdquo; or the survival of conversation around reform, says Pavin. But regardless of the election&rsquo;s outcome, the prospects of real reform of <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> will remain distant, he says, as &ldquo;the real power over Article 112 resides with the &lsquo;institutional gatekeepers&rsquo;&mdash;the Constitutional Court and the Election Commission.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/lookkate.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>It will almost certainly be too slow to make a difference in Lookkate&rsquo;s case. In the meantime, she is savoring what could be her last few months of freedom.</p>



<p>Once a week, she visits her parents in her home province of Pathum Thani, a 40-minute drive from Bangkok, to slurp up her favorite of her mother and sister&rsquo;s cooking: <em>gaeng phed nor mai</em>, beef and bamboo shoots simmered in a red coconut milk curry.</p>



<p>But most days, and often nights too, she keeps busy working&mdash;raising human rights issues during lengthy parliamentary sessions and committee inquiries, drafting motions and questions to ministers, and meeting with constituents.</p>



<p>Once, while campaigning in her constituency in Pathum Thani, a woman asked her if she would flee Thailand in order to avoid imprisonment.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I never thought that my good will would lead to me having to count down until I have no freedom at all,&rdquo; she said, but leaving Thailand isn&rsquo;t a consideration. Instead, she said, &ldquo;I have to work harder and harder and quicker and quicker to make sure that I do all I can for my country before I never have any chance to do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2260002096.jpg" alt="Super Bowl LX - Previews"/>



<p>The <a href="https://time.com/7368808/super-bowl-2026-seahawks-patriots/" >Super Bowl</a> is America&rsquo;s biggest and most-watched sporting event, drawing in more than 100 million viewers in recent years. Its halftime show is one of the most coveted gigs in entertainment. The advertisements that air during its broadcast are the subject of widespread discussion and ranking lists. And together, the whole spectacle marks one of the most commercially impactful annual events in sports all around the world.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Beyond its massive global audience, the Super Bowl also serves as an economic engine for its host city and the country, generating enormous revenue in everything from ticket sales to concessions to hotel bookings, creating jobs, and pouring money into state tax coffers.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6622138/super-bowl-history-facts/" ><em>The History of the Super Bowl</em></a></p>



<p>Last year&rsquo;s Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans generated an estimated $1.25 billion in total economic output across the state, a Louisiana State University study <a href="https://admin.opportunitylouisiana.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ebpr-economic-impact-2025-super-bowl-la-economy-df-page-view1.pdf"  target="_blank">found</a>. That figure doesn&rsquo;t include a slew of other monetary impacts, from the bonuses players received to the millions shelled out by advertisers.</p>



<p>With Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks set to kick off in the San Francisco Bay Area this Sunday, here are a few ways that the event is supercharging the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tourism</strong></h2>



<p>The upcoming Super Bowl will be held at the Levi&rsquo;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the second time that the stadium has hosted the game since 2016. The area is expected to see a flood of people coming for the event&mdash;and with them, a massive influx of money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e4434c5fc376718dd1af892/t/666b0777d3f97375ee8b5dac/1718290297455/BAHC+Economic+Impact+Report.pdf"  target="_blank">study</a> by the Bay Area Host Committee estimated that the event will generate between $370 million and $630 million in earnings across the area, largely fueled by more than 90,000 visitors anticipated to come from outside the Bay Area. In addition to direct spending from those visitors on a range of attractions and services, the committee&rsquo;s calculation also includes money the teams playing in the game are expected to spend on housing, feeding, and transporting players and staff, as well as the logistical costs associated with the game and related events.</p>



<p>Visitors in Louisiana for last year&rsquo;s Super Bowl collectively contributed just over $500 million in spending in the state, according to the LSU study, while vendors associated with the game added roughly another $180 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jobs</strong></h2>



<p>This year&rsquo;s game will also create around 5,000 jobs in the Bay Area across different industries, the host committee&rsquo;s study found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It estimated that as part of its broader economic impact in the area, the event will generate roughly $300 million in labor income.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Government earnings</strong></h2>



<p>Another piece of the total earnings the host area is expected to reap from the game will go toward the state and local governments. The Bay Area Host Committee estimated that those governments will see about $16 million in fiscal revenue.</p>



<p>Much of the income and sales associated with the Super Bowl are subject to state and local taxes. Tax revenue from last year&rsquo;s game in New Orleans, for instance, reached a total of more than $80 million, according to the LSU study.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ticket sales</strong></h2>



<p>With more than 60,000 football fans set to watch Sunday&rsquo;s big game in person, Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, estimated to CNBC that the NFL is will make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkgqRdZNQx4"  target="_blank">close to $400 million</a> in revenue off the sale of tickets and luxury boxes alone. The league set the starting ticket prices at around $6,000, but there are signs that suggest the prices are dropping.</p>



<p>According to TicketData, the current price of a pair of tickets <a href="https://www.ticketdata.com/super-bowl-ticket-prices"  target="_blank">is</a> around $4,300, a sharp decrease from more than $6,000 earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advertisements</strong></h2>



<p>The commercials aired during the Super Bowl ad breaks are just as culturally relevant as the game itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And companies pay hefty sums to get their ads into the broadcast. According to Bloomberg, a 30-second commercial spot during the Super Bowl <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/super-bowl-ad-rates-hit-10-million-for-30-second-spot-nbc-says?embedded-checkout=true"  target="_blank">reached</a> $10 million this year, an increase of more than $2 million from <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-a-super-bowl-commercial-in-2025"  target="_blank">last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aside from the money they put toward securing the spot, advertisers spend millions of additional dollars to produce their commercials, find celebrity endorsers, and promote the ads. Some advertisers are pre-releasing their commercials or small teasers ahead of this year&rsquo;s game to generate buzz on social media. On Sunday, you will be seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7nAJDpGHxY&amp;t=12s"  target="_blank">Emma Stone crying</a>, Lady Gaga <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEATgsMwWAU&amp;t=30s"  target="_blank">singing</a> &#8220;Won&#8217;t You Be My Neighbor,&#8221; and Ben Affleck <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXPd4Glcrzc&amp;t=27s"  target="_blank">showing</a> celebrity friends his cringe TV pilot, among other ad spots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Players&rsquo; payouts</strong></h2>



<p>Only one team will emerge victorious from the Super Bowl. But every player on both the Patriots and the Seahawks has already won a significant bonus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the NFL collective bargaining agreement, each player on the winning team will receive $178,000, while each player on the losing team will receive $103,000. This is a $7,000 increase for each group over the sums awarded for participating players in the 2025 game, and the amounts will continue to increase in the next season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Super Bowl prize money comes on top of the multi-million dollar base salaries and players receive, as well as incentive bonuses they get throughout the season for crossing certain thresholds. New England Patriot defensive tackle Milton Williams, for instance, is on a four-year, $104 million contract, with $63 million in guaranteed money, making him the highest-paid player in Patriot&rsquo;s history, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47758714/new-england-patriots-defense-highest-paid-milton-williams-super-bowl-champion"  target="_blank">ESPN</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Betting</strong></h2>



<p>Sports betting continues to thrive and evolve where gambling is legal all over the country. And as with other major games, the Super Bowl LX is expected to prompt a storm of betting. The American Gaming Association (AGA) <a href="https://www.americangaming.org/americans-to-legally-wager-estimated-1-76-billion-on-super-bowl-lx/"  target="_blank">estimates</a> that Americans will wager a record $1.76 billion legally on Sunday&rsquo;s game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One new phenomenon in the bettor market is that in addition to betting on the specific score of the game, bettors this year are wagering millions of dollars over what phrases the NFL announcers or analysts will or won&rsquo;t say during the event. ESPN <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47781111/super-bowl-nfl-betting-kalshi-mention-markets-announcers"  target="_blank">reported</a> that more than $47 million has been staked this season in so-called &ldquo;mention market&rdquo; on prediction market Kalshi.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The halftime show</strong></h2>



<p>While the Super Bowl halftime show, a cultural phenomenon in and of itself, contributes to the draw for viewers of the event&mdash;as well as the logistical costs and labor that go into it&mdash;artists aren&rsquo;t paid much for their performances.</p>



<p>The artists are paid on a &ldquo;union scale,&rdquo; which guarantees a minimum wage that amounts to more than $1,000 a day. The NFL also covers all production costs associated with the show, according to Brian McCarthy, the organization&rsquo;s vice president of communications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So why would any artists agree to perform for such little pay? Exposure is a big reason. Hours after his halftime show last year, rapper Kendrick Lamar saw a 173 percent <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kendrick-lamar-halftime-show-streaming-jump-spotify-1235262331/"  target="_blank">jump</a> in his streams on Spotify in the U.S., with streaming of his hit song &ldquo;Not Like Us&rdquo; increasing by 430 percent.&nbsp;<br>The NFL itself, meanwhile, gets a more direct monetary benefit from the performance: Apple pays the league nearly $50 million each year to serve as the primary sponsor of the halftime show, according to <a href="https://www.sportico.com/business/sponsorship/2022/apple-super-bowl-halftime-show-1234689478/"  target="_blank">Sportico</a>.</p>

<p>From Tehran to Tabriz, from Los Angeles to London, Iranians are in collective shock, even traumatized by the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s lethal suppression of recent protests that has claimed thousands of lives. But the profound shock and trauma must not make us oblivious to reality or leave us paralyzed by wishful thinking. &nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>What unfolded in Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 will be remembered as the moment when the Islamic Republic made a lethal choice. What began as peaceful demonstrations<a href="https://www.equator.org/articles/the-war-within"  target="_blank"> devolved</a> into violence in several places as the regime severed internet access and its forces opened fire on crowds. The sequence of events leads to a singular conclusion: orders were issued&mdash;presumably directly&mdash;by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to crush the protests by any means necessary, and the security forces did so without hesitation, without restraint, without pity.</p>



<p>Khamenei has spent years being indecisive on countless matters of state policy: whether to build a nuclear weapon, whether to engage and negotiate with Washington, whether to permit even modest reforms. He has been resolute on a single question: the preservation of the Islamic Republic, no matter the cost. He learned that lesson watching Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi hesitate over that very same question during the revolution of 1979&mdash;and lose his throne.</p>



<p>Contesting claims are bound to follow significant violence. The Iranian regime has promoted a narrative<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/17/irans-khamenei-says-us-israel-links-behind-thousands-killed-in-protests"  target="_blank"> claiming</a> its security forces&mdash;police, Basij and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&mdash;opened fire only after<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-says-3117-killed-in-recent-protests-issuing-lower-death-toll-than-human-rights-activists"  target="_blank"> armed rioters</a>, paid and recruited by foreign forces, attacked them, and torched buildings, buses and mosques. Protesters in the country, analysts, and activists in the diaspora insist that the security forces carried out killings on an unprecedented scale, deploying snipers who fired indiscriminately at civilians in the streets and pickup trucks mounted with machine guns that cut down demonstrators. Hundreds of body bags were counted in morgues and hospitals, and estimates of the death toll range anywhere from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-araghchi-trump-threat-crackdown-299375ebfd004dd6098c77a6bb8079a5"  target="_blank">3,117 </a>to as many as <a href="https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/" >30,000</a>. </p>



<p>Political persuasions might sway who you believe but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What horrifies us Iranians, what traumatizes us, is the knowledge that Iranians killed other Iranians on a scale never witnessed before&mdash;not even during the revolution of 1979. Not a single senior official in the security forces stopped himself and said, &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Not a single officer seemingly refused to give the order to shoot. The Iranian security forces, unlike in 1979, apparently had no qualms about injuring and killing their fellow citizens. This is what makes our trauma, as Iranians, so acute.</p>



<p>After the massacres, protests have almost completely subsided despite feckless calls by Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah of Iran&mdash;from the comfort of Washington&mdash;for the people to continue their revolution, presumably to bring him to power. I was able to speak to some of my family members in Iran soon after the crackdown, who said few people were venturing out at night in the face of a heavy security presence on the streets. They see security forces still manning the streets but in comparatively smaller numbers. Many Iranians are returning to work during the day but are anxious about the possibility of a war.</p>



<p>The Islamic Republic is unlikely to collapse anytime soon unless the United States launches a significant military intervention. The regime will most likely survive this crisis and perhaps even limited military strikes by the Trump Administration.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The day after in Tehran</h3>



<p>What are the realistic possibilities for the future of the Islamic Republic of Iran? Some analysts have speculated about a coup by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps generals to seize control of the country, while others have suggested that the Supreme Leader&mdash;viewed as the main obstacle to what would be a humiliating deal with the U.S.&mdash;must be removed for the system to survive. Neither scenario appears plausible, at least in the short term.</p>



<p>The regime has closed ranks. Even prominent reformists, such as Hassan Khomeini&mdash;a grandson of the founder of the Islamic Republic and a potential contender to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader&mdash;have been calling for calm, peace and dialogue. Khamenei may have lost some support among his base, which is estimated at 10 to 20 million diehard followers, motivated by both religious and political reasons. But his top generals and his cadre of Basij militiamen and other security forces remain loyal. Until that loyalty shows signs of fracturing, Khamenei will almost certainly remain in control.</p>



<p>There is another, often, overlooked factor underwriting the resilience of the Iranian regime: the absence of a unified, organized opposition possessing any genuine credibility or legitimacy within the country&rsquo;s borders. Despite his assurances, Reza Pahlavi has failed to demonstrate widespread support inside Iran. Some protesters did chant his name but he has no shadow infrastructure ready to assume governance should a revolution succeed in collapsing the state.</p>



<p>Pahlavi&rsquo;s claim that some<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/exile-iran-prince-reza-pahlavi-50000-defectors-topple-regime/"  target="_blank"> 50,000</a> members<strong> </strong>of the Iranian security forces were prepared to defect after the American and Israeli strikes on Iran last June proved hollow. Moreover, his supporters in the West have<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NewIran/comments/1qm38zc/a_message_to_irgc_and_basij_members_their/"  target="_blank"> threatened</a> the regime&rsquo;s shock troops and bureaucrats with the same fate that befell the Shah&rsquo;s loyalists after the 1979 revolution: mass execution. Such rhetoric would hardly incentivize the regime&rsquo;s security apparatus and civil servants to switch sides.</p>



<p>The other main opposition figure in exile offers no viable alternative. Maryam Rajavi leads the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/opinion/sunday/an-iranian-cult-and-its-american-friends.html"  target="_blank"> Mujahedeen-e-Khalq</a>, a group despised by the vast majority of Iranians. While her agents on the ground retain the capacity to commit isolated acts of terror against regime officials, they possess neither the political capital nor the popular mandate to foment a revolution in her favour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The fire next time</h3>



<p>Yet Iran isn&rsquo;t immune to change. The last year was marked by war, the destruction of its nuclear facilities, and economic collapse. January already portends another grim year. For some time, Iranians will neither sense normality nor muster the energy for a revolution for some time as they mourn their dead and nurse a wounded society.</p>



<p>The <em>nezam</em>&mdash;the regime if you will&mdash;must retrench and devise a solution to the underlying crisis that sparked the protests in the first place. That will require negotiations with the Trump Administration to ensure that the U.S. lifts some of the most crippling economic sanctions on Iran. President Donald Trump has focused his demands on the nuclear issue and on stopping the killings by the Iranian regime. Whether the solution would involve capitulation to Trump&rsquo;s maximalist demands or a more face-saving deal (struck either before he decides to attack Iran or in the immediate aftermath of a symbolic military strike) is impossible to predict.</p>



<p>Hectic diplomacy by Iran&rsquo;s neighbours in recent days&mdash;aimed at brokering some form of d&eacute;tente with the U.S. and averting a military strike, or worse&mdash;has opened a narrow window for compromise. There are signs that Iran and the U.S. are serious about deescalating the tensions between them. The U.S. and Iran <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-iran-hold-nuclear-talks-oman-amid-heightened-tensions-diplomat-says-2026-02-04/"  target="_blank">have agreed </a>to hold talks on Friday in Oman despite differences on their scope: Tehran wants to limit the talks to its nuclear program while Washington insists on including Iran&#8217;s missile arsenal in the negotiations. </p>



<p>Iran is unlikely to accept restrictions on its missile program or limits on the range of its ballistic missiles: a serious degradation of the most vital element of its defense doctrine. But Tehran might conceivably agree to halt uranium enrichment if its right to enrich is formally recognized&mdash;language which was absent from<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html"  target="_blank"> the 2015 Iran nuclear deal</a>. Washington has allowed enrichment in Iran and other countries but maintains that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which Iran has signed, does not grant enrichment as a right to its signatories. The Trump administration is unlikely to reverse that position and set a precedent for Iran&#8217;s Arab neighbors.</p>



<p>Iran could also agree to having its stockpile of highly enriched uranium diluted or removed from the country, and permit the return of IAEA inspectors to sites they monitored before the 12-day conflict last summer. Negotiating a longer-term deal would take time and could include creating an enrichment consortium that would include Iran&#8217;s neighbours as partners&mdash;an idea that was discussed publicly during the earlier rounds of negotiations between Iran, the U.S. and Europe. </p>



<p>Yet without a viable solution, Iranians&mdash;both the government and the people&mdash;surely recognize that the tinder of discontent still smoulders. For years, analysts, pundits, Congressmen, monarchists, assorted revolutionaries and armchair warriors have promoted the wishful thinking that a pro-Western democracy would emerge in Iran if the regime is toppled through a military intervention or collapses after an uprising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fire next time might engulf the entire leadership. The chaos&mdash;economic, social and political&mdash;or even civil war that could follow a collapse of the regime with no viable alternative is something no Iranian should wish for.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://time.com/7362314/winter-olympics-games-milan-cortina-2026-opening-ceremony/" >opening ceremony</a> for the 2026 Winter Olympics is fast approaching, and, with it, one of the most cherished traditions of the Games: the parade of delegations.</p>



<p>Each Olympics typically begins with the Head of State of the host country and the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) entering the venue. The national anthem of the host country is played or sung live while the country&rsquo;s flag is raised. The ceremony also includes the dramatic reveal of the Olympic rings, followed by the Olympic motto: &ldquo;Faster, Higher, Stronger&mdash;Together.&rdquo; After that comes the parade of delegations, which is when the athletes competing in the Games march into the venue under their nation&rsquo;s flag.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>While the media team for the 2026 Games declined to provide the full list of countries participating in the parade, it confirmed that the event will stick to the <a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/Olympic-Games/Factsheets/The-opening-ceremony-of-the-Olympic-Winter-Games.pdf?_ga=2.244967621.1709735226.1632725793-355622370.1626856415"  target="_blank">protocol</a> laid out by the IOC. Per tradition, the nations appear in the parade in alphabetical order based on the language of the host country&mdash;for this year&rsquo;s Milano Cortina Games, Italian.</p>



<p>But there are a few caveats to that rule. Because Greece is where the Olympic Games originated, its delegates lead the parade. The host country also closes out the parade, meaning that, this year, Italy&rsquo;s delegates will appear last.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, since the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, the hosts of upcoming Games have marched just before the current host country, toward the end of the parade. Ahead of Italy playing host this year, the country&rsquo;s delegation marched second-to-last in the <a href="https://time.com/6145111/order-of-countries-opening-ceremony-2022-olympics/" >2022 Beijing Winter Games</a>, entering just before China. At the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the delegations for both the U.S.&mdash;set to host the Games in 2028&mdash;and Australia&mdash;which will host in 2032&mdash;<a href="https://time.com/7002124/olympics-opening-ceremony-country-order/" >marched near the end</a>. The next Winter Olympics are set to take place in the French Alps in 2030, and the U.S. will host the 2034 Games in Utah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the opening ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics, a team of refugee delegates also <a href="https://time.com/7002124/olympics-opening-ceremony-country-order/" >marched second</a>, after Greece, in the parade of nations.</p>

<p>For the 1,559 residents living in the Milan Olympic Village during the <a href="https://time.com/tag/2026-milan-and-cortina-dampezzo-olympics/" >2026 Winter Games</a>, a word to the wise: you could do a lot worse than popping into the complex&rsquo;s <em>Zona Mentale, </em>or &ldquo;Mind Zone.&rdquo; The space, open to all athletes and coaches and team members who call the village their <a href="https://time.com/7353775/climate-change-winter-olympics-2026/" >Olympic</a> home, is optimized for relaxation. You can write postcards to friends and family: on paper, not screens. You can color, just like any kindergartner, to give your mind a break from the monumental task at hand: performing in the biggest global sporting event on Earth. You&rsquo;ve been preparing your whole life for this moment, and may, or may not, get another chance at it. In four years.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Pass the red crayon, please.</p>

<p>In the back of the Mind Zone is a little area called the &ldquo;conversation pod,&rdquo; where athletes can convene for heart-to-hearts or confide to a mental health pro. Then there&rsquo;s the couch, cordoned behind a small barrier for privacy; athletes can use it to catch a nap, or perhaps listen to music on their headphones.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one athlete who comes every day to read for a couple of hours,&rdquo; says Gloria Viseras, an <a href="https://time.com/7000067/olympics-2024-paris-gaza-israel-ukraine/" >IOC</a> staffer&mdash;and <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/gloria-viseras"  target="_blank">gymnast for Spain</a> at the 1980 Moscow Games&mdash;who oversees the space. The bookworm is from Italy, she says. Bet on her for host country glory.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2259718206.jpg" alt="Around The Games - Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics: Day -3" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/villages/milano-olympic-village"  target="_blank">Milan Olympic village</a>, spread across six residential buildings on a former rail yard, is smaller than other versions: for one, the Winter Games have fewer athletes than their summer counterparts; and two, with competitions spread out across northern Italy, the populations of each village are thinned. There are also villages in Cortina d&rsquo;Ampezo, home of women&rsquo;s alpine skiing, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47485471/luge-bobsled-skeleton-winter-olympics-differences-explained"  target="_blank">sliding sports</a>, and <a href="https://time.com/7357758/mixed-doubles-curling-olympics-2026-korey-dropkin-cory-thiesse-interview/" >curling</a>; Antholz-Anterselva, where the biathlon is being held; Predazzo (nordic combined and ski jumping); Bormio (men&rsquo;s alpine skiing and <a href="https://time.com/7353737/skimo-olympics-2026-winter-milano-cortina/" >ski mountaineering</a>); and Livigno (freestyle skiing, snowboard).</p>



<p>Across all the villages, the beds <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1428129/milano-cortina-games-truth-about-2026-olympic-village-beds"  target="_blank">appear to be more comfortable</a> than those from more recent Olympics. In Milan, where the space will be converted to student housing after the Games&mdash;and where the Canadian team erected a moose in front of its residential zone&mdash;the recreation area sports a foosball table, where two French women&rsquo;s ice hockey players were going head-to-head on Tuesday afternoon; a nok hockey table; and a video game area. Olympians can play <a href="https://time.com/7292741/f1-the-movie-joseph-kosinski-brad-pitt-formula-one/" >F1</a> racing games or pretend to be <a href="https://time.com/6212490/carlos-alcaraz-us-open/" >Carlos Alcaraz</a> in a tennis match. A leaderboard displays the best Olympic video game players: small consolation, perhaps, if they also bite it on the ice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2259278164.jpg" alt="Milan Cortina Winter Olympics" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The Milan village mess hall&mdash;where at lunch German and Finnish Olympians sat in groups next to each other, but in their own cliques like freshman and junior cool kids&mdash;serves 3,000 eggs and nearly 1,000 pounds of pasta a day. At Tuesday lunch, the menu included cous cous and salmon and sword fish and pizza margherita, of course.</p>



<p>At the Paris Games, the <a href="https://time.com/7006037/olympic-village-chocolate-muffin-tiktok/" >chocolate muffins</a> were the breakout star. Will there be a Milan version of a viral foodie hit? How about the Turtle Sandwich, a bread product available this week: it was advertised as a mix of wheat flour, salt, brewer&rsquo;s yeast, extra virgin olive oil and sunflower oil? Eh. I wouldn&rsquo;t put it on the podium.</p>

<p>More than 3,500 athletes will head to northern Italy this February to take part in the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, which are being split between the slopes of <a href="https://time.com/7345680/winter-olympics-cortina-history/" >Cortina d&#8217;Ampezzo</a> and the city of Milan. </p>



<p>Milan, a financial and fashion hub in northern Italy, will host ice sports such as <a href="https://time.com/7362679/alysa-liu-skating-olympics-2026-interview/" >figure skating </a>and <a href="https://time.com/7353800/hilary-knight-hockey-winter-olympics-2026-interview/" >hockey</a>, while Cortina, a resort town in an alpine valley in the Italian Dolomites, will host <a href="https://time.com/7366530/can-you-ski-with-a-torn-acl-lindsey-vonn/" >skiing</a>, snowboarding, and other mountain events.</p>

<p>It will be the first time the <a href="https://time.com/7353775/climate-change-winter-olympics-2026/" >Winter Olympics</a> have officially been co-hosted by multiple cities. Milan and Cortina won the bid in 2019, beating a joint bid from Stockholm and &Aring;re in Sweden.</p>



<p>The games will officially start on February 6 and run until February 22. </p>



<p>Here are some fun facts about this year&rsquo;s hosts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Milan is a fashion capital of the world</strong></h2>



<p>Milan is known as the birthplace of many couture brands, including Prada, Armani, and Versace. It is known as the fashion capital of Italy and one of the most fashion-forward cities in the world.</p>



<p>Its reputation dates back to the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, when the city became known as a place to purchase luxury goods. It became known for its silk processing and eventually for costly items such as lace and jewelry. Still, Milan&#8217;s reputation, historians say, was for many years overshadowed by Florence&#8217;s artistry.<br><br>Over time, Milan became known as a hub for more affordable wares than other Italian cities, with its &#8220;ready-to-wear&#8221; fashion at its heart.</p>



<p>The famed Milan Fashion Week, which draws in brands and supermodels from around the world, sealed Milan&rsquo;s fate as a fashion hub that people flock to for its ingenuity, its shopping district, and its culture.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2237608963.jpg" alt="FASHION-ITALY-MILAN-WOMEN-GIORGIO ARMANI" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This is not the first time Cortina hosted the Olympics</strong></h2>



<p>Milan has never hosted the Olympics, but Cortina d&rsquo;Ampezzo has, back in 1956. Cortina, known as &#8220;Queen of the Dolomites,&#8221; is a premier ski resort in northern Italy, about 250 miles from Milan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1265646675.jpg" alt="Bruno Burrini. Vii Olympic Games. Cortina. 1956" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Those games saw the debut of the Soviet Union team, which won more medals than any other nation. The Olympic Oath was also sworn by a female athlete for the first time&mdash;Italian alpine skier Giuliana Chenal-Minuzzo.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Milan hosts Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s Last Supper</strong></h2>



<p>Famed artist Leonardo da Vinci left an indelible mark on Milan during his decades there in the 15th century, after he rose to prominence in Florence.</p>



<p>Milan is home to the Leonardo da Vinci Museum, but his most famous work is present in the monastery Santa Maria delle Grazie: <em>The Last Supper</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-977814448.jpg" alt="Leonardo Da Vinci Prime Idee Per l'Ultima Cena' Exhibition Press Preview In Milan" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The famous mural depicts the final meal Jesus shared with his apostles before his crucifixion, and was commissioned in 1495 by the Duke of Milan for the monastery. The painting is still on display. The work is so coveted, however, that only a few people are allowed in the room to view it at a time, and visits are strictly limited to 15 minutes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Milan is home to the famous Duomo Cathedral</strong></h2>



<p>The Duomo Cathedral in Milan is a world-famous tourist and artistic spot in the city, and its construction spans six centuries. Construction likely began in 1386, and the final details were completed in 1965.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The construction site became a lively space for the exchange of the most diverse ideas, experiences and skills from workers coming from all over the continent, which made the Duomo a crossroads of peoples and cultures and the most European among Gothic cathedrals,&rdquo; <a href="https://cenacolovinciano.org/en/"  target="_blank">the Duomo&rsquo;s website reads.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238147599.jpg" alt="ITA-MILAN-ILLUSTRATION" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>A famous legend surrounding the construction of the Duomo tells of the aristocrat Gian Galeazzo Visconti, who supposedly dreamed that the Devil commanded him to build the church with &ldquo;diabolical images&rdquo; or lose his soul. The aristocrat obliged and ordered the construction of the Duomo.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Milan was founded by the Gauls and known by a different name</strong></h2>



<p>Milan was founded in 600 B.C. by the Gauls and eventually became the capital of the Insubres, a Celtic tribe. Then the city was known by the Celtic name of Medhelanon. Milan was eventually conquered in 222 B.C. by the Roman Empire, which Latinized the name to Mediolanum, which translates to &#8220;in the middle of a plain.&#8221; Under the empire, the city garnered increasing prestige politically and artistically.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Milan is the birthplace of several famed Italian foods</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond art and fashion, Milan is also known as the birthplace of several classic Italian dishes. For one, the famous golden-hued, saffron-infused Risotto alla Milanese is beloved by both locals and visitors.</p>



<p>The city is also known for the founding of the famed Italian sweet bread, pannetone. Although the panettone mixes traditions from across Italy, the pastry was first mentioned in a manuscript from the 1470s, written by a preceptor in Milan&rsquo;s House of Sforza, according to the Smithsonian.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Several famous movies have been filmed at Cortina d&#8217;Ampezzo</strong></h2>



<p>The beautiful Dolomite slopes have captured the attention of moviegoers for years, as several famous films have used the mountains around Cortina d&#8217;Ampezzo as a backdrop. </p>



<p>These films include <em>For Your Eyes Only</em> (1981), in which James Bond visits the Olympic stadium there. The film includes a famous chase scene and climax in which Bond is pursued on a motorbike on the Cortina ski slopes. </p>



<p>The romantic comedy The Pink Panther (1963) was also partially shot in Cortina, as was <em>A Place for Lovers</em> (1968), starring a 27-year-old Faye Dunaway.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-125375910.jpg" alt="For Your Eyes Only" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cortina is a part of the largest ski network with a single pass in the world</strong></h2>



<p>The Cortina resort alone has around 75 miles of groomed slopes, but it lies within the greater Dolomiti Superski network of 12 distinct ski resorts, 450 lifts, and 750 miles of slopes. The network is the largest ski area in the world accessible by a single pass.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The first Olympic Games Planned For Cortina were canceled</strong></h2>



<p>Cortina d&#8217;Ampezzo was chosen to host the Winter Olympic Games before 1956, but the 1944 Games planned for the town, as well as the Summer Olympics in London, were canceled because of World War II. </p>



<p>This was the second consecutive Olympics <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">canceled due to wartime conflict, as the 1940<strong> </strong>Games were also canceled</span> after the conflict escalated in 1939. The 1940 games were originally to be held in Tokyo, Japan. After the Second Sino&ndash;Japanese War, the government withdrew its bid to host the games,<a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/lost-olympics-1940-and-1944"  target="_blank"> citing the need </a>to conserve wartime resources. The IOC eventually reassigned the Games to Helsinki, Finland, though the Finnish government was eventually forced to cancel the event after the Soviet Union invaded their country in 1939.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>These will be the most geographically widespread Olympic Games ever</strong></h2>



<p>These Olympic Games will be held across Northern Italy, across hundreds of miles. Although many events will take place in the host cities of Milan and Cortina, there will also be events in other mountain areas, including Livigno&mdash;a ski resort in the Italian Alps&mdash;and Bormio, as well as in the Fiemme Valley. The closing ceremony will take place in a 2,000-year-old Roman amphitheater in Verona.</p>

<p>Spain has proposed a ban on social media for kids under the age of 16, joining a growing number of countries that have moved to protect children and teens from potential online harms.</p>



<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez announced the ban on Tuesday at the World Government Summit in Dubai, where he criticized tech companies for failing to rein in disinformation as well as illegal content like child sex abuse material and sexualized deepfake images on their platforms.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;Social media has become a failed state, a place where laws are ignored, and crime is endured, where disinformation is worth more than truth, and half of users suffer hate speech,&rdquo; S&aacute;nchez said. &ldquo;A failed state in which algorithms distort the public conversation and our data and image are defied and sold.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Today, our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We will no longer accept that.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The ban needs parliamentary approval, which could be discussed next week, S&aacute;nchez said. It is among a series of five government measures targeting social media platforms. S&aacute;nchez said Spain had joined five other European countries to form the &ldquo;coalition of the digitally willing&rdquo; aimed at coordinating cross-border regulation of social media. It is not yet known which other countries are part of the alliance.</p>



<p>A number of other countries across the world have implemented or are considering restrictions on kids&rsquo; access to social media. Greece is planning to announce a ban soon, an official source told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-hold-social-media-executives-accountable-illegal-hateful-content-2026-02-03/"  target="_blank">Reuters</a> on Tuesday, while French lawmakers approved a social media ban last week, sending the bill to the Senate. In December, Australia <a href="https://time.com/7339762/australia-youth-social-media-ban-under-16-snapchat-meta-tiktok/" >became the first country in the world</a> to introduce a blanket ban on under-16 access to a slate of social media platforms.</p>



<p>&ldquo;No more pretending that technology is neutral,&rdquo; S&aacute;nchez said.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about Spain&rsquo;s ban, which other countries have social media bans, and how tech companies are responding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Spain&rsquo;s ban works</h2>



<p>Spain will require social media platforms to use age verification systems, S&aacute;nchez said. These will be &ldquo;not just check boxes, but real barriers that work,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>On many social media platforms, the typical minimum age to make an account is 13, but historically this has been difficult to enforce.</p>



<p>Spain has not yet specified which platforms will be affected by the ban. At the summit, S&aacute;nchez singled out X for its AI chatbot <a href="https://time.com/7344858/grok-deepfake-crisis-explained/" >Grok, which has come under global scrutiny</a> for generating illegal sexual content including of minors; TikTok for allegedly allowing accounts to share &ldquo;AI-generated child abuse materials,&rdquo; and Instagram for allegedly &ldquo;spying on millions of Android users.&rdquo;</p>



<p>TIME has reached out to TikTok, xAI and Meta for comment.</p>



<p>S&aacute;nchez also said Spain plans to criminalize the manipulation of algorithms to boost illegal content, as well as hold tech executives personally accountable if they do not remove illegal content. Such measures will require parliamentary approval.</p>



<p>S&aacute;nchez said the ban will be debated by parliament as soon as next week, where it will join a broader bill aimed at creating digital protections for minors. The center-right People&rsquo;s Party, the biggest opposition party in parliament, signaled its support for the measure, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/spain-social-media-ban-children-under-16s-77ac5a2e2078f175bd61dbfb5ad9deb7"  target="_blank">Associated Press</a>. PP previously floated proposals to restrict minors&rsquo; social media access, according to <a href="https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2025/12/13/el-pp-propone-prohibir-el-acceso-a-redes-sociales-de-menores-de-16-anos-salvo-consentimiento-expreso-de-los-padres/"  target="_blank">Spanish media</a>.</p>



<p>But the bill could still face opposition, including from the far-right Vox party, which said that the ban was intended to make sure that &ldquo;no one criticizes&rdquo; the S&aacute;nchez government, according to the AP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where youth social media bans are taking shape</h2>



<p>Last week, French lawmakers <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20260127-french-lawmakers-pass-bill-banning-social-media-for-under-15s?utm_source=chatgpt.com"  target="_blank">approved</a> a bill that would ban social media use for children under 15 and aims to protect them from excessive screen time, cyberbullying and other harms. The legislation, which would take effect in September before the next school year, involves stricter rules on age verification and restrictions on mobile phone use in schools. The bill heads to the Senate ahead of becoming law.</p>



<p>In December, Australia introduced a blanket ban on social media for under-16s&mdash;widely described as a <a href="https://time.com/7273443/australia-social-media-ban-anthony-albanese/" >first-of-its-kind law in the world</a>. The ban affects Instagram, Facebook, Threads, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, X, Reddit, Twitch, and Kick, although the list of platforms is subject to change over time.</p>



<p>Malaysia said last year that it <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3340200/impulse-control-malaysias-social-media-ban-targets-teen-minds"  target="_blank">planned</a> to introduce a social media ban for under-16s beginning in January, although that deadline has been <a href="https://www.asiaone.com/malaysia/malaysias-social-media-ban-those-under-16-may-come-early-july"  target="_blank">pushed back</a> to July. Malaysia <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-lifts-suspension-grok-xai-chatbot-elon-musk-5878546"  target="_blank">temporarily banned</a> X&rsquo;s Grok over its sexualized images and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3338411/malaysia-tightens-grip-major-social-media-platforms-will-it-make-internet-safer"  target="_blank">introduced</a> a law requiring social media platforms with more than eight million local users to operate under licenses.</p>



<p>Indonesia said it <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/business/2025/12/29/indonesia-to-start-restricting-childrens-social-media-access-in-2026.html"  target="_blank">plans</a> to enforce social media restrictions for teens aged 13 to 16 beginning in March. Indonesia also <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2026/02/indonesia-stops-blocking-grok-chatbot-after-assurances-from-parent-company/"  target="_blank">briefly banned Grok</a>, and requires social media companies to operate in the country <a href="https://time.com/7323424/indonesia-tiktok-operating-license-suspension-lifted-protests-livestreaming-user-activity/" >under licenses.</a></p>



<p>Denmark has also <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/denmark-to-ban-social-media-for-children-under-15/a-74666210"  target="_blank">announced a plan</a> to ban social media access for users under 15, with possible exemptions for younger teens with parental consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A senior government source told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-hold-social-media-executives-accountable-illegal-hateful-content-2026-02-03/"  target="_blank">Reuters</a> that Greece is also close to rolling out a ban on social media access for children under 15.</p>



<p>New Zealand and the U.K. are also weighing restricting access to social media for minors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the U.S., a number of states have moved to curb kids&rsquo; access to social media. At least eight states&mdash;Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee&mdash;have <a href="https://www.multistate.us/insider/2025/10/8/eight-states-enact-minor-social-media-bans-despite-court-fights"  target="_blank">enacted legislation</a> that either bans minors from social media or requires parental consent for them to make an account. Several states, however, are facing legal challenges. Laws restricting minors from social media have been permanently blocked in Arkansas and Ohio over First Amendment violations and temporarily blocked in California, Florida, and Georgia. Louisiana is also facing litigation, and agreed not to enforce its law while the case plays out.</p>



<p>In the 2025 state legislative session, 18 states proposed similar legislation, although just one was enacted: Nebraska passed a measure requiring parental consent for anyone under 18 to make a social media account, which takes effect in July. Virginia also enacted a bill that aims to curb the addictive nature of social media by limiting users under 16 to one hour per day of social media use unless parents consent, which took effect in January. Several more states, including California and New York, have enacted bans on &ldquo;addictive algorithms.&rdquo;</p>



<p>At the federal level, Sen. Brian Schatz (D, Hawaii) introduced the <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/kosma"  target="_blank">Kids Off Social Media Act</a> (KOSMA), which would bar children under 13 nationwide from accessing social media, as well as prohibit social media companies from using certain algorithms for users under 17. The bill was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/278"  target="_blank">approved</a> last June by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and awaits action by the full Senate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How tech companies have responded</h2>



<p>Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who owns X, has been vocal in criticizing social media bans, including the latest proposal from Spain. After S&aacute;nchez&rsquo;s speech in Dubai, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2018746867056513207?s=20"  target="_blank">posted</a> on X, &ldquo;Dirty S&aacute;nchez is a tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In another <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2018773911907811678?s=20"  target="_blank">post</a>, he said, &ldquo;S&aacute;nchez is the true fascist totalitarian.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Other tech companies have raised concerns with blanket social media bans, although all of those affected by Australia&rsquo;s world-first ban, including X, said in December that they planned to comply. In December, Reddit <a href="http://g"  target="_blank">filed a lawsuit</a> against Australia over its ban, arguing that it threatens free speech and interferes with political discussion. Meta, which owns Instagram, Facebook, and Threads, said that by January it had <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/social-media-sites-block-4-7-million-underage-accounts-in-australia-c33d3254"  target="_blank">removed nearly 550,000 accounts</a> in Australia based on its new age verification requirements.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We call on the Australian government,&rdquo; Meta said in a <a href="https://medium.com/meta-australia-policy-blog/update-on-metas-compliance-with-social-media-age-ban-law-7d811845db60"  target="_blank">blog post</a>, &ldquo;to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age-appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics will officially begin with an opening ceremony that features the likes of Mariah Carey and Sabrina Impacciatore.</p>



<p>The ceremony has been designed around the idea of <em>armonia</em>, or harmony, which organizers say represents both movement in sports and a sense of inclusion as athletes and spectators from around the world gather for the Games.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Marco Balich, who is producing the opening ceremony, described the inspiration for the theme as a type of convergence: between the two host cities, &ldquo;Milan and Cortina, city and mountain, the harmony between man and nature, between cultures, people and different ways of thinking.&rdquo; The Dolomite ski resort of Cortina hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956.</p>



<p>&ldquo;In this moment, where forces and bullies are predominant, I think it&rsquo;s very important for all of us to embrace the values that the Olympics represents, which is to compete respectfully and peacefully between all the countries and nations, summarized in the title &lsquo;Harmony,&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; Balich told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/milan-cortina-opening-ceremony-rehearsals-olympics-1acc32327bc435e01c5b6f178db3f260"  target="_blank">Associated Press</a>.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about the Milan 2026 Olympics Opening Ceremony.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When will the opening ceremony be held?</h2>



<p>The ceremony will begin at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. E.T.) on Feb. 6, 2026, in Milan and is set to last around two to three hours. The ceremony coincides with the arrival of the Olympic torch relay and the formal gathering of athletes from around the world.</p>



<p>A few competitions will already have taken place. The Winter Games begin on Feb. 4 and Feb. 5 with preliminary matches and qualifying races in curling, women&rsquo;s ice hockey, and men&rsquo;s snowboarding. The first day of <a href="https://time.com/7345540/2026-us-olympic-figure-skating-team-men-women-pairs-dance/" >figure skating</a> also takes place on Feb. 6 before the opening ceremony.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where will the opening ceremony take place?</h2>



<p>The ceremony will be held at San Siro Stadium in Milan. But other ceremonies will be taking place in other cities at the same time, with the lighting and extinguishing of two Olympic cauldrons for the first time. One will be in Milan at the Arco della Pace and the other at the Piazza Dibona in the historic mountainous town of Cortina d&rsquo;Ampezzo.</p>



<p>&ldquo;For the first time, the name of our Games includes two cities, which means we have to hold the most significant moments twice: the flag-raising ceremony and the lighting of the Olympic cauldron will take place in two locations, and we have to manage this visibility,&rdquo; said Andrea Varnier, the CEO of the organizing committee.</p>



<p>There will also be simultaneous celebrations and athlete parades in other places across Italy that are hosting Olympic events, including Livigno in Valtellina, which hosts snowboarding and freestyle events, and Predazzo in Val di Fiemme, which is home to skiing competitions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who will produce, participate in, and perform at the opening ceremony?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSSBHgmCO-N"  target="_blank">Carey</a> is slated to perform at the opening ceremony in San Siro Stadium. The organizing committee said in a statement that the artist known for hits such as &#8220;We Belong Together&#8221; &ldquo;fully represents the emotional atmosphere that accompanies the run-up to the Games. Music is a universal language that attracts different stories and sensibilities, and intertwines with the opening ceremony&rsquo;s theme of harmony.&rdquo;</p>



<p>She will be joined by Impacciatore, who is known for her roles in HBO&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6223583/the-white-lotus-season-2-review/" ><em>The White Lotus</em></a> (2022) and NBC Peacock&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7311682/the-paper-office-spinoff-review/" ><em>The Paper</em></a> (2025). Other performers include crossover tenor Andrea Bocelli, actor Pierfrancesco Favino, singer Laura Pausini, actress Matilda De Angelis, and violinist Giovanni Zanon.</p>



<p>The ceremony will also include a special tribute to late fashion designer <a href="https://time.com/7314777/giorgio-armani-death-jodie-foster-oscars/" >Giorgio Armani</a>.</p>



<p>American rapper <a href="https://time.com/7277168/snoop-dogg-interview-time100-2025/" >Snoop Dogg</a> will again be a part of NBC&rsquo;s Olympics broadcast coverage after he <a href="https://time.com/7007181/snoop-dogg-olympics/" >became a viral sensation</a> as a roving correspondent during the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. He was also <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/hey-coach-snoop-snoop-dogg-announced-as-team-usa-s-first-honorary-coach"  target="_blank">named</a> an honorary coach for Team USA.</p>



<p>The ceremony is being produced by Balich Wonder Studio. Balich has been involved in producing a record 16 Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies, from Turin in 2006 to Rio in 2016, as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup opening in Qatar.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you watch the opening ceremony?</h2>



<p>Tickets for the ceremony are available on the <a href="https://tickets.milanocortina2026.org/en/event/cerimonia-di-apertura-milano-san-siro-olympic-stadium-19253556/?affiliate=26O"  target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>



<p>Broadcasters around the world will also air or stream the event. In the U.S., NBC will air the opening ceremony at 2 p.m. E.T. and 8 p.m. E.T., with on-demand streaming available on Peacock.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-001.jpg" alt="Sunset in Tehran"/>



<p>When a friend asked Henry James how he endured the devastation of World War I, the writer replied, &ldquo;Feel, feel, feel all you can.&rdquo; His exhortation contains the essence of what it means to remain human. Totalitarian regimes try to dismantle our capacity to feel, render us numb, confiscate our humanity, the way censors black out passages in books.</p>



<p>When I think of Iran, I think of light. I think of the play of light on leaves, on water, on mountains. I was born in Tehran, and when I looked out of the window of my living room, I would look at Mount Damavand, our tallest mountain peak, covered with a halo of snow. I think of that. And I think of our poetry nights in Tehran. I think of the writer and editor Houshang Golshiri teaching us classical Iranian poets during our poetry nights. I think of reading Ferdowsi and Nizami in our living room and the living rooms of my friends.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>In December, the Iranians rose up in protest. The Islamic Republic spoke its only language: violence. And again the morgues and graveyards of Iran received fathers and sons, mothers and daughters. For me, as for millions of Iranians, this struggle is not political. It is existential. The first thing the Islamic Republic did, like any totalitarian system, was take away our right to live. They did it by literally killing people. And they did it by trying to reshape the citizens, turn us into figments of their imagination, to create a new Iranian.</p>



<p>I was teaching in Tehran during the revolution in 1979. I didn&rsquo;t know myself at the time.</p>



<p>The Islamic Republic made me understand a lot of things by taking them away. They were confiscating my history and my identity as a human being. They were depriving us of contact with the world, making us believe that nobody cared about us. I felt the isolation they imposed upon us was a trap we could only escape by feeling, living, and resisting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was leaving Tehran, my mother followed me around the apartment. &ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; she kept saying, &ldquo;tell them.&rdquo; Tell the world what is happening to us. I had to write, as Primo Levi put it, &ldquo;in order to rejoin the community of mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last night I could not sleep. I kept thinking of three people. The only way I can repay my debt to them is to keep them alive through their stories. So I will tell you of<a href="https://iranwire.com/en/women/122061-iranian-influential-women-farrokhru-parsa-1922-1980/"  target="_blank"> Dr. Farrokhru Parsa</a>. She was the principal of my high school in Tehran. She was very strict. She would stand at our high school door, checking the length of our uniforms. We would make poems and stories about her. She became, along with my mother, one of the first six women to be elected to the Iranian parliament in 1964. She became the minister of education, changed the representation of women in school textbooks, and significantly advanced the education of girls and women in Iran.</p>



<p>The Islamic Republic came for her. They charged her with crimes from &ldquo;propagating corruption<a href="https://iranwire.com/en/women/122061-iranian-influential-women-farrokhru-parsa-1922-1980/"  target="_blank"> and</a> prostitution&rdquo; to &ldquo;violating Islamic morality.&rdquo; A revolutionary tribunal in Tehran declared her a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.iranrights.org/memorial/story/34914/farrokhru-parsa"  target="_blank">corruptor on earth</a>&rdquo; and sentenced her to death in May 1980. The legend is that they put her in a sack because you are not supposed to touch a woman and killed her by shooting at the sack. Some say they just hanged her or stoned her. It was a time when I felt immense despair. Many Iranians quote, what is believed to be Dr. Parsa&rsquo;s last message from her prison cell to her children: &ldquo;I am not going to<a href="http://www.iranian.com/ArdavanBahrami/2005/May/Parsa/index.html"  target="_blank"> bow</a> to those who expect me to express regret for fifty years of my efforts for equality between men and women. I am<a href="https://iranwire.com/en/women/122061-iranian-influential-women-farrokhru-parsa-1922-1980/"  target="_blank"> not prepared</a> to wear the chador and step back in history.&rdquo;</p>



<p>I stayed in Iran. And that brings to me my second story, my second person. He was my student at Allameh Tabatabai University in Tehran, where I was teaching English literature during the war with Iraq. He had fought in the war and was very active in the Muslim Students Association, which worked as an instrument of ideological conformity and state control on campuses. He had the power to throw me out of the university. Or worse!</p>



<p>One day, as I was teaching Henry James, we heard this noise in the hall outside. Two students rushed in with the news: this young man had brought two cans of petrol with him, doused himself, and set himself on fire. &ldquo;They have betrayed us,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;They have betrayed us.&rdquo; Some of my students made jokes when his body was being carried out. It made me very unhappy. I scolded them. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what he has done,&rdquo; a student retorted.</p>



<p>I realized there is another kind of death. The regime shapes us into its likeness, hardens the heart. I tried to convey that to my students through the teaching of the novel. A great novel is multi vocal and speaks on behalf of many. The novel threatens the lies of a totalitarian regime like the Islamic Republic. The novel nurtures curiosity and empathy.</p>



<p>My third story is about Razieh. I only remember her first name. In 1979, I was teaching contemporary American fiction at a small girls college in Tehran. Razieh was my student.</p>



<p>She was a practicing Muslim. Her mother was a cleaning lady. Her father was dead. She was a thin, small girl, with her veil framing her face. She was serious. I can see her face. Razieh would walk with me to the university gates and we would talk about Henry James and Jane Austen. She fell in love with Henry James. She loved the independent women in his stories. These women sacrificed their happiness but they did the right thing, she would say.</p>



<p>Razieh was curious. Curiosity, the desire to know another, is &ldquo;insubordination in its purest form,&rdquo; as Vladimir Nabokov said. You don&rsquo;t accept just what is but seek what could be or should be. After that term, I moved to Tehran University. I saw Razieh once on the street. She gave me a sign not to talk to her. It was the year after the revolution, and the repression had started. Some years later, Mahtab, another former student of mine, came to see me at Allameh Tabataba&#8217;i University, where I was teaching at the time. She had been in jail but had been released for good behavior. She had met Razieh in jail.</p>



<p>Razieh and Mahtab had forged a bond in prison over their love of literature. Razieh would talk about Henry James; Mahtab would talk about F. Scott Fitzgerald. At a certain point in her telling, Mahtab paused. &ldquo;You know, Razieh was executed.&rdquo; I can still see her. Even in prison, even while waiting for her execution, Razieh chose life. She reached far beyond her prison cell through literature. Her bond with the novels and stories of Henry James transcended death and reaffirmed life.</p>



<p>When I lived in Iran my father would tell me that this country is very ancient and was invaded many times. What gives us identity and continuity, he would say, is our poetry stretching back hundreds of years to Ferdowsi, Hafiz, Jami, and Saadi. When this regime came to power, they did more than arrest and kill poets and writers.</p>



<p>They tried to erase our cultural memory. They tried to destroy the statue of Ferdowsi, our epic poet, and rename the street honoring Omar Khayyam, our poet, astronomer, and philosopher. But Iranian women stood in front of that street sign and would not let them change it. It was one small victory among countless defeats. The regime would call our cultural traditions pagan, but Iranians still make pilgrimages to the shrines of our poets.</p>



<p>The Islamic Republic of Iran is the Soviet Union of the Muslim World&mdash;a modern theocracy with imperialist ambition&mdash;and it is an ideology, a system that has failed. When I look at the younger generation in Iran, I see hope. The protests are both new and rooted in our history. Women have been fighting for freedoms, gaining ground despite oppression. What gives me hope is seeing women and men, the merchants and the retirees, all sections of Iranian society come together in the recent protests.</p>



<p>I have been thinking of Vaclav Havel, who wrote, &ldquo;Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.&rdquo; The protesters in Iran show us that freedom is an ordeal, and you even pay for it with your life. <strong>As told to Basharat Peer</strong></p>

<p>The Islamic Republic&rsquo;s already lengthy catalogue of fears has ballooned of late: alongside the possibility of being overthrown by its own citizens, it is haunted by the prospect of a full accounting of the massacres it has carried out; by the tenuous loyalty of its army, and its empty coffers; and by the shadow of Israeli spies and Islamic State militants. What terrifies Iran&rsquo;s theocrats the most, the fear that eclipses all their fears, is the ability of the people at large<strong> </strong>to clearly see the essential realities of the present regime.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>While Iranians have heroically demanded a great many things in recent weeks&mdash;change, new rulers, democratic freedoms&mdash;they are fundamentally insisting on dismantling the meticulously curated edifice of deceit and falsehoods sustaining the state as it has been constructed since 1979. For the first time ever, by explicitly chanting the name of a specific, alternative leader in the streets, Iranians have emphasized the true problem: the biggest, the most unsustainable lie of all, they are collectively saying, is the system itself.</p>



<p>The founding myth of the Islamic Republic rested on a<a href="https://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/iran-and-democracy"  target="_blank"> contract</a> of rule that promised the people agency and accountability. Instead, it empowered an unelected, ever-shrinking clique answerable to no one but itself. For years, deception remained essential to its survival. Now, soaring<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589791826000022#bib11"  target="_blank"> food insecurity and hunger</a> have exposed the system for what it truly is: a theoretical fabulism and a real life con. The profound significance of the recent protests lies in their creation of a vast public space where tens of thousands repudiated the lie in unison. The veil was shredded, the illusion was shattered. Nothing will ever be the same. That is why the regime has killed ruthlessly, and killed as it has never killed before.</p>



<p>On the road to this moment, the regime&rsquo;s attempts to hide reality grew increasingly fantastic. I remember during the Covid-19 pandemic, when Western countries refused to sell the ventilators to Iran (sanctions are sanctions) and thousands were dying unnecessarily, the regime blanketed Tehran with billboards professing that Iranians had &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; the pandemic together. As if that one scalding insult wasn&rsquo;t enough, the propaganda campaign went even further, with banners claiming that Iranians were triumphant in virtually all aspects of modern life&mdash;they were also world champions in sport, fine practitioners of democracy, innovators in medicine.</p>



<p>This while the regime banned women from global sports tournaments that might imperil their modesty, leading to defections of talented female athletes; while it tampered so egregiously with elections that many people stopped bothering to vote; while people suffered a catastrophic shortage of basic drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every facet of life and governance is presented as the inverse of its lived reality. And anyone who dares to peek behind the curtain&mdash;journalists, dissident professors, activists, even, bizarrely, the Iranian<a href="https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/b0004eli"  target="_blank"> president</a> himself&mdash;becomes a threat to the regime.</p>



<p>The Iranian<a href="https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2025/feb/17/report-corruption-perceptions-iran-2024"  target="_blank"> economy</a> is a grand hall of mirrors, concealing criminal theft on an epic scale. Fake<a href="https://amwaj.media/en/article/how-iranian-style-privatization-stunts-the-real-private-sector"  target="_blank"> privatizations</a>, hidden backroom tenders, currency<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/406c8beb-170d-4db0-8b3c-e368249b0c2f"  target="_blank"> tiers</a> purportedly designed to favor consumers, and bank<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/bank-collapse-iran-protests-83f6b681?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqd_g4xyv1asf2bu9j2PjNffLG6dtrvQdzxw0tXnyoCRIY2YZz6K03C2b6jGvDI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6974d6ac&amp;gaa_sig=3t-y6OdKJYmWi7O7YHuJoslD-0r5bmJSi4kal-pmkmkO5yhzfeyFoMjB5u0cFOj-g-WKqIKE6VnPUx5bciMSsg%3D%3D"  target="_blank"> bailouts</a> have enriched<a href="https://www.clingendael.org/publication/nepotism-islamic-republic-iran"  target="_blank"> oligarchs</a> rich while impoverishing the nation. The regime blames its bankruptcy on sanctions and claims to be working toward their removal while making foreign policy choices guaranteed to trigger more sanctions.</p>



<p>Every crisis is shrouded in lies that mask its real cause: Why is Tehran running out of water? Why is a gas-rich country facing electricity shortages? Why does a single family dominate the import of agricultural feed? Why, as a former mayor of Tehran, demanded in his newspaper last week, do 40 million Iranians live below the poverty line while the state operates mega charitable foundations with billion-dollar budgets ostensibly to help the poor? For this candor, his paper was shut down.</p>



<p>Demands for transparency are increasing because revelations about this despairing state of affairs will clarify precisely who is accountable. The truth risks bringing down the whole edifice, which is why the system writhes to hide who takes decisions large and small. Who decided the system for how oil revenue should be repatriated, leading to bottomless theft? The examples are endless. But concealment is expensive, and the regime is out of money. Previously, it had the funds to partially hide the consequences of its mismanagement and theft through subsidies and handouts. Now, bankruptcy is bringing clarity.</p>



<p>The failure of the regime&rsquo;s ideological project has been evident for at least two generations, but acknowledging how society has evolved&mdash;that it has long been<a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/02/22/half-baked-revolt-in-iran/"  target="_blank"> living</a> according to its own reality&mdash;remains forbidden. Protests in Iran are often symptoms of changes that have already occurred: a howling demand for these shifts to be recognized and for an end to the exhausting charade of pretense.</p>



<p>The &ldquo;<a href="https://time.com/6219585/why-iranian-protesters-chant-woman-life-liberty/" >Women, Life, Freedom</a>&rdquo; protests of 2022 represented, in part, a collective act of refusal by women to perpetuate the charade of compliance with everything dress codes imposed by the state symbolized: ersatz piety, state hypocrisy, control over Iranian women&rsquo;s bodies, and the manifest absence of the rule of the law. Women and girls had long defied the hijab law, but finally, fed up, they rose up and wielded the power of mass disobedience to extend their freedom into spaces symbolic of state control: schools, airports, and banks. It was as much a revolt by young girls and women against this fa&ccedil;ade as anything else.</p>



<p>What is striking about this specific generation of young Iranians is their moral clarity and demand for complete transparency. They have concluded that pragmatically maneuvering around lies, allowing the regime to operate in the shadows, makes collaborators of everyone. They refuse this abusive predicament. They refuse to be estranged from themselves by tolerating it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regime&rsquo;s war against transparency has led to increasingly bizarre scandals. The state filtering and control of the internet forces ordinary Iranians to purchase Iranian-made VPNs (made and sold by what one Iranian legislator<a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/irans-vpn-mafia-blamed-for-delays-on-the-lifting-of-telegram-ban-heres-what-we-know"  target="_blank"> called</a> a &ldquo;VPN mafia&rdquo;). In November, X started revealing<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/x-user-location-feature-country-elon-musk-new-rcna245620"  target="_blank"> approximate locations</a> of its users. Soon, Iranians found out that the regime had issued<a href="https://itemlive.com/2025/12/23/commentary-irans-white-sim-card-scandal-reveals-privilege-state-control-and-fake-dissent/"  target="_blank"> so-called white SIM cards</a> that allowed unrestricted global internet access to thousands of journalists, officials, and pro-state figures. When it was revealed in December that some opposition journalists&mdash;the loudest critics of the regime&mdash;had quietly benefited from these &ldquo;white SIMs&rdquo; a scandal ensued that became a Russian nesting doll of lies.</p>



<p>The revelations of brazen digital inequality and manufactured dissent humiliated Iran&rsquo;s President Massoud Pezeshkian, who had campaigned on lifting internet restrictions. He not only found himself stymied despite running the executive, but also had a major cover-up on his watch. Forced to turn his pledge into a lie, his dramatic solution was to impose filtering equally on everyone. He declared ominously: &ldquo;We have instructed that these white internet lines be turned black as well, to show what will happen to people if this blackness continues.&rdquo;</p>



<p>We have grown accustomed to asking what Iranians want, whether they prioritize livelihoods or democracy, whether they wish for a king but might tolerate a practical, secular general. Yet at every turn what they have been demanding is an end to the secrecy through which the regime hides its failings and imposes an alienated life of falseness on its people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transparency is the one fundamental condition they demand, and with it would flow everything else: accountability, a revelation of the true causes of the country&rsquo;s terminal condition, and the exposure of the regime&rsquo;s structural rot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For years now, I have held on to a very specific dream. I am somewhere in Tehran, my hometown, canvassing for an election. I knock on an apartment door, and an elderly woman answers. &ldquo;Madar Jaan,&rdquo; I address her, using the Persian term of endearment and respect. &ldquo;Will you consider voting for the Left Party of Iran?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Sometimes, in the dream, she tells me to get lost. Other times, she shows interest, and I explain that our party is socialist, that we want to build more Metro stops and open a new factory in the neighborhood. She says she&rsquo;ll think about it. The biggest dreams sound so ordinary. The scene from my dream is commonplace not only in my adopted home, the United States, and other liberal democracies, but even, in a constrained fashion, in the neighboring Turkey and Pakistan. For it to come true in Iran, much would have to change.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>I was born in Iran in 1988. For all but the first year of my life, my homeland has been ruled by the same man: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader who has final authority over every major decision but is accountable to no one. I have voted in the elections of the Islamic Republic but every candidate on every ballot was vetted for total fealty to Khamenei. A political party sharing my own convictions of democratic socialism couldn&rsquo;t dream of legally existing in Iran. Neither could any political party outside the Islamist framework. This prohibition has kept me away from Iran for years now. My politics renders me persona non grata. </p>



<p>Every protest in Iran is a reminder of the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s cruelty and a renewed call for its demise. Even the slightest improvement seems unimaginable without an end to the regime. But I have never believed it enough to simply declare what we oppose, what we don&rsquo;t want. We must also dream of what could be. My very specific fantasies about the Iran of the future are my way of keeping the political imagination alive and open.</p>



<p>One day at the height of the anti-regime mass protests in Iran in 2022, I had a long, tearful conversation with a dear friend. We allowed ourselves to alternate our mourning with dreams about the future. My friend and I, like most Iranians, are embarrassingly exceptionalist about our homeland, convinced that Iran can rival any country in its offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We dreamed of working for the Iranian tourism board, designing ad campaigns to lure travelers from every corner of the world. Iran&rsquo;s Shia shrines already draw millions of pilgrims from Muslim countries. We dreamed of a day when millions of Jews might also visit the Tomb of Esther and Mordechai in Hamadan, and millions of Baha&rsquo;is could visit the holiest land of their faith.</p>



<p>We dreamed that the Saadi Foundation, a government-run institution dedicated to promoting Persian language, might host well-attended classes in Lisbon, Montreal and Johannesburg. Instead of its current fare of dour Islamist pretension, it would offer the best of Iranian arts and culture: our cinema, our poetry, perhaps even our wine. I am sure my more artful compatriots would come up with something less tacky but we did come up with a tagline: &ldquo;Taste the Shiraz Wine That&rsquo;s Actually from Shiraz.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Of Iran&rsquo;s many squandered possibilities, the waste of our soft power stings the most. Even if Iran never became a robust democracy, couldn&rsquo;t its institutions at least align more closely with our national interests and our cultural heritage? Couldn&rsquo;t we use them not to further some regressive ideology but to disseminate our culture and leverage it for economic growth? </p>



<p>Some might argue that fantasies, by definition, know no bounds. I don&rsquo;t dream of democracy as some promised land of milk and honey but as what it actually is: a parliament composed of representatives freely chosen by the populace; a chance, I would have, to persuade a fellow Iranian to vote for my politics.</p>



<p>I know that, no matter what follows the regime, we are not about to be Denmark. All I want is for us to have a chance to serve our country. The Iranian state was a founding member of both the League of Nations and the United Nations. Ours is one of a handful of countries never colonized by Europeans. Freed from the ideologues who have held them hostage, even most bureaucrats serving in the Islamic Republic today could rediscover the best of our history and reorient their efforts toward our nation&rsquo;s improvement.</p>



<p>In my dreams, I always remember that Iran is not mine alone. Like any other country, we have our social progressives and our conservatives, our devout and our atheists, our saints and our crooks. And with so much murder and mayhem in our contemporary history, many Iranians treat one another with suspicion and rancor.</p>



<p>But I continue to set my north star with a slogan once used by Iranian reformists: &ldquo;Iran for all Iranians.&rdquo; I dream, then, of lazing on the beautiful beaches of the Caspian Sea or the Persian Gulf, where some Iranians would don a bikini and others a burkini. I dream of frequenting a leftist bookstore on Tehran&rsquo;s fabled Enghelab Avenue while others browse its Islamist or libertarian counterparts. In my fantasies, we all share the country together, without tearing it apart for the sake of our vision.</p>



<p>As Iranians mourn and bury their loved ones&mdash;killed in their thousands by the regime this month&mdash;it is hard to speak of fantasies. Though I see writing on the wall for the Islamic Republic, I know we have no easy path to democratization. But I will never stop dreaming of the Iran that could be.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iran-protests-092.jpg" alt="Protests Against The Regime In Iran"/>



<p>On Feb.1, 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini arrived in Tehran after 15 years of exile in Turkey, Iraq, and a little village outside Paris. Millions of Iranians saw him as a spiritual man who would usher in democracy and deliver a better economic life. They welcomed him. Khomeini and his supporters delivered neither. Instead, they gradually transformed the Shah&rsquo;s authoritarian, secular monarchy into a totalitarian theocracy. </p>



[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>From the earliest days of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iranians found themselves confronted with a political theology that defined the ideological contours of the power struggle in their society. The people&rsquo;s sovereignty and capacity for collective action were eclipsed by an uncompromising, monolithic order embodied in Ayatollah Khomeini&rsquo;s leadership and institutionalized through his doctrine of <em>Velayat-e Faqih </em>(the guardianship of the Islamic jurist), which concentrated authority in the hands of a supreme religious jurist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The doctrine of <em>Velayat-e Faqih </em>allowed Khomeini to supersede the political views of other government officials and the popular will itself. The constitution was thus wrested from the Iranian people and appropriated by a ruling cadre that imposed its own interpretation of Islamic law upon them. Blind obedience to the Supreme Leader&rsquo;s will transformed violence against victims into patriotism and a righteous struggle against &ldquo;corruptors on earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subsequently, the loss of rights suffered by a wide range of Iranians&mdash;Baha&#8217;is, gays, feminists, dissenting intellectuals, and young people with non-ideological dreams&mdash;became a widespread loss of identity. But as the population swelled from around 38.5 million in 1980 to over 92 million today, post-revolutionary Iran grew younger and more rebellious than revolutionary. </p>



<p>Over the past 30 years, a new type of Iranian, who is defined by the absence of ideology, has emerged. These Iranians embrace individualism and global culture through the internet, and simply want to exist and act as citizens within their society. A new vision of society has taken hold in Iran&mdash;nourished by these new Iranians, particularly young women&mdash;and it has chipped away at the legitimacy of the regime.</p>



<p>For more than four decades, Iranian women have been trying to reclaim parts of their personal lives upended by the revolution in 1979. One of the defining images of the revolution in 1979 was an Iranian woman in a traditional black Shiite chador holding a G-3 rifle. Today, the iconic image of the protests in Iran is different: a young woman setting her headscarf on fire and chanting against Iran&rsquo;s clerical rulers.</p>



<p>Violence has been the primary language of the Islamic Republic since 1979. The regime has repeatedly met economic, social and political demands of Iranian citizens with prison cells and graves. The 1979 revolution did not leave any space for persuasion, plurality, and mutual recognition. Political authority does not rest with citizens acting together; it is controlled by the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards. For 47 years, violence has forced compliance, but it has not generated legitimacy for the Iranian regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every turn to state violence in Iran has served as evidence of erosion of its authority, a self-defeating strategy to maintain the status quo: violence substitutes consent with massacre and undermines the popular legitimacy on which any government ultimately rests. And yet, after 47 years of civil resistance and nonviolent confrontation, Iranians have converted the loss of their sons and daughters, and their private sufferings into public claims. They have built new, lasting repertoires of protest and forms of dissent that survive individual campaigns of repression.</p>



<p>Today Iranians are mourning thousands of their fellow citizens who were massacred during savage crackdowns on recent protests in Iran. What endures after all the killings is storytelling. If Iran is to have a democratic future, the differences within the Iranian society have to be confronted and argued through, not buried. That work carries a warning: ending an illegitimate government is to refuse to support a new dictatorial and corrupted regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be an Iranian today is to live within the memory and continuity of Persian civilization, to sustain an ethics of beauty and embody an act of resistance against an ugly and tyrannical Iran. If Iran remains beautiful, then the idea of Persia is more than mere ornament adorning the corpse of an ancient civilization. It is the revolt of beauty and freedom against the ugliness of tyranny and the wilful forgetting of horror.</p>

<p><em>Translated by Sara Khalili</em></p>



<p>Today, the Islamic Republic of Iran resembles a half-lifeless body collapsed on the ground, yet still possessing powerful arms. With the support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other military forces, it has attacked the people of Iran and, <a href="https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/" >through widespread killings</a>, has delivered a brutal blow to the <a href="https://time.com/7345555/iran-protests-deaths-us-trump-israel/" >popular uprising</a>. Yet this is only a temporary success. The republic is already dead morally, economically, and socially.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>In just a short span, the currency collapsed, and the dollar surged from 70,000 rials to more than 1,400,000 rials. The government has become one of the most disgraced regimes in the world, it has dragged the country into deep decline, and it is now incapable of feeding its own people. Even if we assume that the regime has narrowly escaped collapse at this moment, its political survival must be understood as temporary rather than enduring. It will fall at another. All that is required is for the backbone of the Revolutionary Guards to break&mdash;and this is not a fantasy, but a realistic possibility. Ultimately, the Guards themselves will turn toward the people.</p>



<p>Over the past several years, Iranians have repeatedly risen in the streets to oppose the regime, driven by a complete exhaustion of tolerance for the Islamic Republic. This government has been hated since its formation. The first demonstration against it took place within the very first month of its establishment, when women poured into the streets to protest compulsory hijab. At that time, men remained largely silent, believing the issue of forced hijab to be unimportant&mdash;unaware that &ldquo;women&rsquo;s hijab&rdquo; would soon be placed on their heads as well. When men are unable to form political parties and are forced to live under an imposed Islamic order, they too are, in effect, veiled.</p>



<p>Soon after that initial protest, dissatisfaction spread and the country entered a long downward spiral. Liquor stores were shut down. Dancing was banned. At the same time, prisons filled beyond capacity, and the same groups that had once fallen victim to the Shah&rsquo;s executions were now being executed again. Approximately ten thousand members of the Mujahedin and leftist political organizations were sent before firing squads. A significant portion of the population emigrated and scattered across the world. Nearly all of Iran&rsquo;s top students left the country.</p>



<p>Public life grew uniformly austere: radio and television programming was reduced to religious content, political activity was prohibited, university professors were dismissed, and hostility toward the United States and Israel intensified. Cities took on the atmosphere of graveyards, and mourning black became the dominant color of daily life. The Islamic Republic rejected pre-Islamic Persian history, as if nothing of value had existed in Persia before Islam. Ancient history was removed from textbooks and effectively erased from public education.</p>



<p>Despite it all, Iranians remained progressive and creative. Writers and filmmakers produced works of great value. The populace continued to advance, remaining active in every field. This persistence troubled certain foreign powers that, at various moments, had supported the Islamic Republic in the hope of weakening Iran as a nation.</p>



<p>Yet Iranians continued to progress. Gradually, they began to reshape and reform the system from within. Political activity slowly reemerged. These efforts repeatedly culminated in mass protests demanding change and the end of the government. Compulsory hijab has all but disappeared since the protests following the death of Mahsa Amini and the globally echoed &ldquo;Woman, Life, Freedom&rdquo; movement.</p>



<p>The unrest of <a href="https://time.com/7358425/trump-iran-massive-armada-nuclear-deal/" >January 2026</a> marks the most significant moment in this long struggle. Intolerable economic conditions drove Iranians to the limits of their endurance. Bazaar merchants took to the streets, and the public stood behind them. A genuine uprising took shape&mdash;so significant that many now refer to it as a revolution.</p>



<p>As this article is being written, the movement continues. The Islamic Republic has shut down the internet and cut off telephone communications, paralyzing the country. The regime is resorting to massacres to suppress the unrest. Thousands have been killed. Thousands more have been imprisoned.</p>



<p>Still, the protesters have not capitulated. This uprising is momentous and will have profound consequences. It began in a way that ensures its continuation. At present, with all forms of communication severed between the people of Iran and the outside world, we remain uncertain of the precise developments unfolding inside the country. However, we have seen heartbreaking images of overflowing morgues, masses of young victims wrapped in black shrouds, families wandering among them in search of their loved ones.</p>



<p>I believe the fate of the Islamic Republic will soon be determined. It will either collapse or undergo fundamental reform and transformation. My prediction is that figures from within the Revolutionary Guards will seize power. Although the slogan most often heard is &ldquo;Long live the monarchy,&rdquo; I do not believe this will become reality. We must wait and see what unfolds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Five leading Iranian writers reckon with a shattered uprising, a despotic regime and a country edging toward its final season.]]></description>

<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module ad-300-250"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7362807"></div></div>

<p>The men who rule the Islamic Republic of Iran came to power in 1979 after millions of ordinary people filled the streets to demand the end of a despotic regime. Looking out their windows in the <a href="https://time.com/7345555/iran-protests-deaths-us-trump-israel/" >first days of 2026</a>, they knew exactly what they were seeing on thoroughfares and boulevards. </p>



<p>They also knew how to clear them.</p>



[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>On Jan. 8, Iranian authorities shut down the internet and gave security forces their orders. What followed was one of the most intensive massacres by gunfire since World War II. Thousands were killed nationwide. Although the precise toll is difficult to verify, Iranian health officials tell TIME that the numbers could far exceed most estimates, with <a href="https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/" >30,000 people killed</a> in 48 hours.</p>



<p>President Donald Trump had promised the U.S. would &ldquo;come to the rescue&rdquo;; <a href="https://time.com/7358425/trump-iran-massive-armada-nuclear-deal/" >it did not</a>. The regime claimed victory. As January wound down, the President pointed toward the U.S.S. <em>Abraham Lincoln</em> aircraft carrier group and pressed the ayatollahs for &ldquo;a deal.&rdquo; Iranians counted the dead.</p>



<p>In the pages that follow, five Iranian writers assay the state of the country they long to return to. Known for most of its 2,600 years as Persia, it has been the Islamic Republic of Iran for less than half a century&mdash;a radical, catastrophic experiment in governance whose final hours will be determined by ordinary people now driven indoors by truck-mounted machine guns.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Iran&rsquo;s economy is in free fall. And the despots quail. As one exiled journalist put it in 2022, the last time Iranians reclaimed public spaces: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if this is the final episode of the Islamic Republic. But it&rsquo;s the final season.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The original version of this story misstated the area that officials in the Iranian Ministry of Health said had produced 30,000 deaths on Jan. 8 and 9. It was the whole of the country, not Tehran alone.</em></p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Anutin-Thailand-Election.jpg" alt="Bhumjaithai Party Holds Election Rally In Bangkok"/>



<p>As nicknames go, <em>Noo</em>&mdash;or &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; in Thai&mdash;has proven particularly apt for Anutin Charnvirakul, whose 2016 biography, &ldquo;Where There Is a Hole, There Is Mouse,&rdquo; pays tribute to his canny knack for wriggling out of tight spots and into opportunities. The latest burrow that Anutin has ensconced himself in is no less than Thailand&rsquo;s 1920s neo-Gothic Government House, replete with teardrop chandeliers and classical nudes, and where the burly 59-year-old today serves as the nation&rsquo;s third Prime Minister in two years. Not that he appears overawed by his new digs.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;I love working regardless of my position,&rdquo; Anutin tells TIME with a shrug. &ldquo;As long as I can deliver my assignment and people&rsquo;s expectations.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Whether Anutin stays in his current exalted position will be decided by those people in a general election on Sunday, though judging by the cunning manner of his ascent, you wouldn&rsquo;t bet against him. On Aug. 29, Thailand&rsquo;s Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister <a href="https://time.com/6271855/thailand-paetongtarn-shinawatra-election-interview/" >Paetongtarn Shinawatra</a> for ethical misconduct. The ruling stemmed from a leaked phone call with Cambodia&rsquo;s former leader, Hun Sen, about a <a href="https://time.com/7305413/thailand-cambodia-border-war-hun-sen-manet-paetongtarn-thaksin-shinawatra/" >deadly border dispute</a>, during which she called him &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; and disparaged a senior Thai Army commander as her &ldquo;opponent.&rdquo;</p>



<p>With Thailand thrust into political paralysis, Anutin&mdash;then interior minister&mdash;became Prime Minister thanks to the backing of the progressive <a href="https://time.com/7317196/thailand-natthaphong-ruengpanyawut-peoples-party-election-profile/" >People&rsquo;s Party</a>. The party controversially supported his candidacy in return for a promise of elections within four months, as well as a referendum on a new constitution that sought to clip the wings of Thailand&rsquo;s military-royal power nexus&mdash;which, not uncoincidentally, happen to be Anutin&rsquo;s chief backers.</p>



<p>Indeed, Anutin had other ideas. In parliament, his conservative Bhumjaithai party voted against the subsequent constitutional amendment, blowing up his Faustian pact with the People&rsquo;s Party, which proposed a no-confidence vote that he was sure to lose. Instead, Anutin suddenly dissolved parliament on Dec. 12, sending Thailand back to the ballot box while retaining for himself the momentum of incumbency. In addition, dissolving parliament killed that constitutional amendment bill stone dead. Progressive lawmakers wryly noted that <em>Noo</em> also means &ldquo;rat.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Anutin denies accusations of &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo; from the People&rsquo;s Party. &ldquo;Bhumjaithai only promised to start the process to initiate the amendment of the constitution,&rdquo; he grins. &ldquo;The deal did not include that Bhumjaithai had to agree to the new constitution.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It was a maneuvering classic of Anutin, who&rsquo;s proven a political chameleon willing to blow with the prevailing winds. But whether Anutin can parlay that gamesmanship to retain Thailand&rsquo;s top job is the big question. Polling puts his Bhumjaithai party in second or third place, but Anutin has several cards up his sleeve, not least backing from Thailand&rsquo;s powerful brass hats and royal palace.</p>



<p>While Thailand&rsquo;s progressive <a href="https://time.com/6310002/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-move-forward-interview-profile/" >Move Forward Party</a> won 38% of the popular vote and a plurality of 151 legislative seats in the 2023 election, it was blocked from forming a government by the senate and then dissolved by the Constitutional Court, just as its progenitor Future Forward Party had been three years earlier. In addition, 10 of Move Forward&rsquo;s leaders were hit with political bans with another 44 cases pending, including 25 current lawmakers for the heir People&rsquo;s Party. </p>



<p>It means that while the progressive movement may again win the popular vote, its reformist agenda remains anathema to Thailand&rsquo;s elites and its chances of taking power are slim. &ldquo;The establishment will not tolerate a People&rsquo;s Party government,&rdquo; says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.</p>



<p>This leaves the door ajar for Anutin to once again head a coalition government. While that would hardly be a triumph for democracy, apologists argue it may be the least-worst outcome, given nobody gains from more political upheaval, bloodshed on the streets, and the very real possibility of military intervention. (Since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, Thailand has weathered 12 successful and nine failed coups, more than any other nation.)</p>



<p>Anutin&rsquo;s detractors accuse him of being an anachronistic throwback to old-style venal money politics that won&rsquo;t arrest Thailand&rsquo;s economic tailspin. (The economy grew by just 1.5% last year.) His backers, meanwhile, say he&rsquo;s a canny operator who is uniquely placed to balance Thailand&rsquo;s conservative political traditions with the aspirations of regular voters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anutin says his goal is simple: &ldquo;to win the election in order to continue the work that I wanted to do, but haven&rsquo;t had enough time.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>Elections are fraught affairs in Thailand. The self-styled Land of Smiles projects a hospitable, harmonious fa&ccedil;ade in glossy tourist brochures, though control of political levers is fiercely contested. Only twice over the last quarter-century has an elected government completed a full term, with the rest all ousted by military and judicial interventions&mdash;tumult interspersed with often deadly street protests.</p>



<p>The old battle lines were drawn between the Bangkok-based elite and predominantly rural followers of Thaksin Shinawatra. A policeman turned media mogul, Thaksin mobilized Thailand&rsquo;s populous northeast as the key to power, prompting the establishment to accuse him of vote-buying and deploy every form of skullduggery to sideline him. (Anutin was once a deputy health and interior minister under Thaksin and was banned from politics for five years when his Thai Rak Thai Party was dissolved in 2007.)</p>



<p>Today, Thaksin sits in jail for corruption and abuse of power, and this is the first election in recent memory that isn&rsquo;t a de facto referendum on his influence. This is both due to generation shifts and the woeful performance of the last government led by his Pheu Thai party. (The recently ousted Paetongtarn is Thaksin&rsquo;s youngest daughter.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Anutin-Paetongtarn-Shinawatra.jpg" alt="THAILAND-POLITICS" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Instability in Thailand is of particular concern for the U.S., given the Kingdom is America&rsquo;s oldest ally in Asia and previously served as a democratic beacon and bulwark against the communist fervor engulfing its neighbors. Yet the nation&rsquo;s establishment has also been drifting closer to China. &ldquo;The People&rsquo;s Party&rsquo;s reform agenda would be less accommodating to China,&rdquo; says Thitinan.</p>



<p>Indeed, in November King Maha Vajiralongkorn made the first-ever visit by a reigning Thai Monarch to the People&rsquo;s Republic to mark half-a-century of diplomatic ties. Anutin was also on the China trip and says he was struck by strongman Xi Jinping, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, addressing King Vajiralongkorn with fawning honorifics reserved only for the apogee of Thai royalty. &ldquo;I really appreciated the way the President of China addressed my King,&rdquo; says Anutin. &ldquo;I felt deeply touched by the way they conducted bilateral relations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Anutin, whose ancestors all hail from China, denies that Thailand is drifting into Beijing&rsquo;s orbit and away from the U.S. &ldquo;Thailand does not see the world in binary terms,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We cooperate with all partners based on mutual benefit, international norms, and regional stability.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Anutin does, however, hope that Chinese investment can help boost a sluggish economy. Thailand suffers from weak productivity gains, a shrinking labor force, high labor informality, and crippling household debt. Vietnam, which posted 8% growth last year, is poised to overtake Thailand as Southeast Asia&rsquo;s second biggest economy this quarter and is also eating its lunch when it comes to tourist arrivals, STEM graduates, and FDI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Anutin-Xi-Jinping.jpg" alt="SOUTH KOREA-GYEONGJU-CHINA-XI JINPING-THAI PM-MEETING" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Bhumjaithai is campaigning on subsidies, low-interest loans, and cash handouts to boost consumption, but critics say the approach merely papers over the cracks. However, Anutin&rsquo;s bringing back technocrats into government&mdash;his Finance Minister is a career banker who most recently served as director-general of the Treasury&mdash;has proven popular. &ldquo;People are receptive to the idea of having Thai politics more driven by professionals rather than traditional politicians,&rdquo; says Napon Jatusripitak, coordinator for the Thailand Studies Program at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, Anutin insists he&rsquo;s all in favor of painful structural reform and would happily break up the monopolies that stymie competition and growth&mdash;despite such reforms ostensibly being contrary to establishment interests. He says he wants to unleash a &ldquo;regulatory guillotine&rdquo; to slash red tape and foster a vibrant business environment. &ldquo;Monopolies only benefit individuals, but deregulation benefits the whole country,&rdquo; he says.</p>



<hr/>



<p>Although Anutin projects a carefully curated everyman persona, he is very much of elite stock&mdash;a scion of Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, one of Thailand&rsquo;s largest construction firms responsible for several government mega-projects, including Bangkok&rsquo;s Suvarnabhumi Airport. Anutin&rsquo;s father is Chavarat Charnvirakul, a former interior minister for the establishment-aligned Democrat Party. He spent eight years studying and working in New York&mdash;first reading engineering at Hofstra University followed by a stint at Mitsubishi Corporation&mdash;before returning home to take up an executive role in the family business.  </p>



<p>Since entering public life in 1996, he has proved himself the consummate retail politician. As health minister, he greeted post-pandemic foreign arrivals with flower garlands and handed out 1 million free cannabis plants to farmers. His social media accounts are filled with singing karaoke, cooking Thai staples in a smoldering wok, or playing his saxophone. Twice divorced, he once <a href="https://www.khaosodenglish.com/life/2025/09/05/the-sweetheart-behind-anutin-thailands-new-prime-minister/"  target="_blank">quipped</a> that he was &ldquo;president of the hen-pecked husbands association.&rdquo; He collects Buddhist amulets and is a keen aviator, flying his blue-and-white turboprop aircraft, which he has regularly used to fetch hearts, lungs, kidneys, and eyeballs back from far-flung provinces for transplant under the Hearts With Wings program.</p>



<p>Anutin grew to prominence by championing Thailand&rsquo;s 2022 <a href="https://time.com/6208192/thailand-war-on-drugs-weed-legal/" >cannabis decriminalization</a>, even wearing a marijuana leaf pattern shirt while voting in the following year&rsquo;s election. But it&rsquo;s a policy that chafes with Anutin&rsquo;s current guise as a bastion of the establishment, highlighting his flair for political opportunism. In truth, decriminalizing cannabis was simply the most popular of several policy gimmicks his upstart party flirted with before Thailand&rsquo;s 2019 election. (Others included remedying the gray legal status of ride-hailing service <a href="https://time.com/6283751/grab-superapp-anthony-tan/" >Grab</a>&mdash;Southeast Asia&rsquo;s equivalent of Uber&mdash;and introducing a four-day workweek.) </p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Anutin-Cannabis.jpg" alt="Thailand Legalizes Marijuana" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>But as a result, tourists strolling the Thai capital have their pick of hundreds of shops emblazoned with neon marijuana leaves selling glistening buds of White Widow, Hindu Kush, and Lemon Skunk. Still, conservatives baulk at the chaotic implementation of decriminalization and farmers complain that cannabis deregulation hasn&rsquo;t seeded the profitable industry promised. &ldquo;I would say the rollout has been largely successful,&rdquo; says Anutin, &ldquo;but there is room to further tighten certain regulations after the election.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not Anutin&rsquo;s only controversial policy. As health minister, he was criticized for the slow procurement of COVID vaccines as well as racist rants at Western tourists who refused to don face masks. Since becoming Prime Minister, he has been forced to apologize for botched flood relief efforts in Thailand&rsquo;s deep south and a series of fatal infrastructure and transport accidents. Those failures&mdash;including two separate crane collapses within 48 hours that claimed dozens of lives&mdash; sparked intense public outrage amid accusations of a &ldquo;doom loop&rdquo; of graft and cost-cutting. </p>



<p>&ldquo;We need to start by changing mindsets&mdash;at the state level, private sector and within families&mdash;so that safety becomes a new social norm, not an optional concern,&rdquo; he says.</p>



<p>In addition, Anutin has faced censure for a lackluster response to the <a href="https://time.com/6899646/scams-trafficking-drugs-southeast-asia-golden-triangle/" >proliferation of online scam syndicates</a> hugging Thailand&rsquo;s frontiers with Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia, which prompted People&rsquo;s Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut to accuse Anutin of a &ldquo;failure of national leadership.&rdquo; But Anutin has politically benefited from Thai-Cambodia border clashes, which have hidden longstanding public concerns about undue military influence behind a veil of patriotism.</p>



<hr/>



<p>Skirmishes first broke out last May over the disputed jungle frontier with both sides deploying troops, artillery, and even airstrikes. So far, dozens have been killed, hundreds injured, and up to half a million displaced by the fighting. In late July, U.S. President Donald Trump intervened to broker a ceasefire, threatening to hike tariffs on both sides if they didn&rsquo;t comply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always nice to see people who are wanting peace,&rdquo; says Anutin of Trump&rsquo;s intervention. Still, clashes erupted most recently in early December, just days before Anutin dissolved parliament.</p>



<p>&ldquo;A lasting solution requires the two countries to jointly establish a mutually accepted and permanent map,&rdquo; says Anutin. &lsquo;While firmly protecting Thailand&rsquo;s sovereignty, our goal is a peaceful, secure, and economically productive border.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While sparking a serious humanitarian crisis for both nations, the fighting is politically problematic for the People&rsquo;s Party. The 2023 election was framed as a vote on the military&rsquo;s involvement in politics, but today the generals are ostensibly out of government&mdash;depriving the progressives of a useful foil. Meanwhile, the border crisis is stoking jingoistic pride, meaning resurgent popular support for the armed forces and Anutin as their hawkish champion. &ldquo;I work with the military as colleagues, I never placed myself as their superior,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 2023, the Move Forward Party floated the rhetorical question &ldquo;What are soldiers for?&rdquo; as part of its campaign to highlight the military&rsquo;s dubious role in politics and business, including golf courses, horse-racing tracks, Muay Thai stadiums, hotel chains, conference centers, free trade zones, and even TV and radio stations. However, this question has now been resurrected and amplified by conservatives as evidence of a perfidious lack of patriotism. &ldquo;The People&rsquo;s Party is being attacked by all sides,&rdquo; says Thitinan.</p>



<p>The progressives face other headwinds that make repeating their stunning victory from three years back even more challenging. In 2020, unprecedented public protests erupted across Thailand that shattered taboos by openly calling for royal reform and especially of <a href="https://time.com/6296556/thailand-lese-majeste-reform-teen-crop-top/" >Thailand&rsquo;s draconian royal defamation law</a>, known as <em>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</em> or Article 112, which is accused by critics of stifling all dissent. However, the Move Forward Party was dissolved on the flimsy pretense that campaigning on reforming Article 112 was unconstitutional, meaning the People&rsquo;s Party has been forced to shy away from this cornerstone issue, effectively neutralizing a key liberal rallying point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Anutin-Thailand.jpg" alt="International Conference on the Global Partnership against Online Scams" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Asked whether he would consider reforming Article 112, Anutin replies without a hint of irony that &ldquo;demand to amend this law has significantly subsided,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;even political parties that previously sought to advance this issue have publicly stated that it is no longer part of their policy agenda.&rdquo;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s also dissatisfaction with how People&rsquo;s Party lawmakers&mdash;nearly all political neophytes&mdash;have performed on a constituency basis. Historically, Thai politics, especially in rural areas, has been dominated by influential local families, known as <em>baan yai</em>, who distribute cash handouts and other inducements to maintain support. The People&rsquo;s Party pledged to do away with antiquated patronage politics&mdash;though now many voters are feeling the pinch. &ldquo;Some have buyer&rsquo;s remorse,&rdquo; says Napon.</p>



<p>By contrast, other than technocrats Anutin&rsquo;s Bhumjaithai has aggressively courted <em>baan yai</em> from across the political spectrum, deftly encouraging rival clans not to split the vote by competing against each other, but instead stand in separate constituencies under the Bhumjaithai banner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compounding matters, the People&rsquo;s Party&rsquo;s unholy alliance with Bhumjaithai in exchange for elections has further muddied the water for progressives. Since all parties have refused to be drawn on potential post-election tie-ups, even protest voters are at a loss where to cast their ballot lest they end up inadvertently supporting the object of their rebuke. At the same time as casting constituency and party ballots in the general election, Thais are also voting in a referendum on whether to rewrite the constitution&mdash;without any specifics of what the alternative might look like.</p>



<p>It has left an extremely confused, conflicted electorate. The fault lines of the last election were clear: Whether to allow the generals to continue in politics. But this time around is fuzzier, with governing style, personalities, and constituency concerns more prevalent. Certainly, polling suggests that a coalition of sorts is likely. Asked who he&rsquo;d be prepared to do a deal with, Anutin issues the shrug of a seasoned opportunist. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to see the result before making any decision,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Because you need to listen to the people. And I never fail the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s (DOJ) release of files related to investigations into Jeffrey Epstein on Friday has revealed further details about his ties to powerful figures in the United States. </p>



<p>The new batch of some three million pages included never-before-seen communications between Epstein and Secretary of Commerce <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlr0nk8y9o"  target="_blank">Howard Lutnick</a>, Tesla <a href="https://time.com/7362868/elon-musk-epstein-emails/" >CEO Elon Musk</a> and billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates, to name a few. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The presence of someone&#8217;s name or communications in the files is not proof of wrongdoing. </p>



<p>Read more: <a href="https://time.com/7345940/bill-clinton-hillary-epstein-deposition-investigation-subpoena-house-contempt/" ><em>Clintons Refuse Subpoena in Epstein Inquiry as Republicans Threaten Contempt Proceedings</em></a></p>



<p>But the files have also revealed Epstein&rsquo;s global reach, causing shockwaves far beyond the United States.</p>



<p>From a resignation in Slovakia&#8217;s government to the fall of a Labour Party Lord in the United Kingdom, here is how the latest batch of Epstein files is reverberating worldwide. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Peter Mandelson resigns from the House of Lords   </strong></h2>



<p>Peter Mandelson, a Member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom, resigned from the Labour Party on Sunday after appearing in the most recent batch of Epstein files released on Friday. </p>



<p>Bank statements released in the pages suggest that Epstein made $75,000 in payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson. The alleged payments were separated into three $25,000 sums between 2003 and 2004.</p>



<p>The files also suggest that after his release from prison in 2009, Epstein sent thousands of dollars in bank transfers to Peter Mandelson&rsquo;s then-partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva.&nbsp; A spokesperson for Mandelson told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/pressure-grows-on-mandelson-to-testify-over-epstein-as-peer-is-told-this-is-the-end-13501842"  target="_blank">Sky News: </a>&#8220;Neither he nor his husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, has any record or recollection of receiving payments in 2003 or 2004 or know whether the documentation is authentic.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;There are also multiple formatting errors in the documents and I would like JP Morgan to confirm on the record that they are certain these documents are authentic and that the individual cheques are also authentic,&rdquo; Lord Mandelson told Sky News.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Until this fact checking has been achieved I maintain my original position which is that I have no record and no recollection of ever receiving these sums and that these statements are false,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>The revelations continued for several days after their release. Mandelson came under further pressure when communications emerged that appear to show that Mandelson leaked a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00750065.pdf"  target="_blank">government memo</a> to Epstein while he was business secretary in 2009. The memo, written by an advisor to then-prime minister Gordon Brown, proposed billions of dollars worth of asset sales and revealed Labour&rsquo;s tax policy plans. In June 2009, Mandelson apparently forwarded the memo to Epstein, with the attached comment, &ldquo;Interesting note that&#8217;s gone to the PM.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Epstein replied: &ldquo;What salable assets?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Land, property I guess,&rdquo; Mandelson said.</p>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7316349/peter-mandelson-fired-uk-ambassador-united-states-epstein-controversy/" >Mandelson was fired as the U.K.&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States in September</a> after the country&rsquo;s foreign office said that a previous release of emails showed that the extent of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein was &ldquo;materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Starmer&rsquo;s spokesperson told journalists Monday that he &ldquo;believes that Peter Mandelson should not be a member of the House of Lords or use the title.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;However, the prime minister does not have the power to remove it. He is calling on those in the Lords to work with the government to modernise disciplinary procedures in the house, to allow for the easier removal of Lords who have brought the house into disrepute.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Former Royals in turmoil </strong></h2>



<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, was <a href="https://time.com/7330018/prince-andrew-royal-title-stripped-king-charles-jeffrey-epstein-controversy/" >stripped</a> of his titles and evicted from his royal residence by Buckingham Palace in October 2025 after years of controversy over his well-known ties to Epstein. He is the subject of allegations from one of Epstein&rsquo;s most vocal victims, the late Virginia Giuffre, who said in her posthumous memoir that she was forced to have sexual encounters with Andrew when she was a teen, which the British royal has repeatedly denied.</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor is once again in the news as the newest batch of Epstein files show photographs of the former royal leaning over a woman or girl lying on the floor, whose face has been redacted. It is unclear where the photographs were taken, as no captions or comments accompanied them.</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and has denied Giuffre&rsquo;s accusations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new files add further political pressure on the former royal to testify before Congress about his links to Epstein. The House Oversight Committee called on the former royal to travel to Washington for questioning.</p>



<p>&#8220;In terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information,&#8221; Starmer told reporters Friday. &#8220;Epstein&#8217;s victims have to be the first priority.&#8221;</p>



<p>Former Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson, Mountbatten-Windsor&rsquo;s ex-wife, also appears in the files. The documents include communications between her and Epstein, including messages in which she called him the &ldquo;brother I have always wished for.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Bank account<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/86231d33-bfc9-4ec5-9a93-aa4f06084d2d?accessToken=zwAGSdpA6hIgkdOGIx0zv8lOxdOak6pPBghNLQ.MEUCIQC4w1TvEKOv4OlBXcKd8xrYRtVoXbYKRZAKGSpx0PjbsgIgEZMvo66tzCix0IMjU8ZtiDxVVbEmDYvMzMzCIKiKNnY&amp;sharetype=gift&amp;token=1c01d017-99ad-4496-b889-5a8c67e6025b"  target="_blank"> statements</a> appear to show that Epstein wired $150,000 to Ferguson in 2001. A spokesperson for the former royal told the<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/86231d33-bfc9-4ec5-9a93-aa4f06084d2d?accessToken=zwAGSdpA6hIgkdOGIx0zv8lOxdOak6pPBghNLQ.MEUCIQC4w1TvEKOv4OlBXcKd8xrYRtVoXbYKRZAKGSpx0PjbsgIgEZMvo66tzCix0IMjU8ZtiDxVVbEmDYvMzMzCIKiKNnY&amp;sharetype=gift&amp;token=1c01d017-99ad-4496-b889-5a8c67e6025b"  target="_blank"> Financial Times</a> that the payment was related to share options she had earned as an ambassador for the brand Weight Watchers.</p>



<p>&ldquo;[Epstein] put the initial money to facilitate the transaction which was then repaid to him 48 hours later together with the profit on the transaction which was the 150k paid to her,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It was a big transaction and with share options, you have to pay for them before you can get the profit&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. it was the only time she has ever done any dealings with him,&rdquo; they added.  </p>



<p>Other documents appear to show Ferguson receiving thousands of dollars&rsquo; worth of flights from Epstein for herself and her daughters.</p>



<p>Multiple charities cut ties with Ferguson in September 2025 after a prior email release revealed the extent of Epstein&#8217;s and Ferguson&rsquo;s friendship. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A minister resigns in Slovakia</strong></h2>



<p>The national security adviser to Slovakia&#8217;s Prime Minister Robert Fico has resigned in the wake of the latest document drop by the DOJ after his name was among those who allegedly corresponded with Epstein.</p>



<p>The text messages and emails appear to show a discussion between Miroslav Lajcak, a former Slovak foreign minister, and Epstein about movies, foreign affairs, and women. </p>



<p>In one series of text messages, a Lajcak <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01619729.pdf"  target="_blank">appears</a> to message Epstein: &ldquo;Regards from Kiev! Just to confirm that girls here are as gorgeous as ever:)&rdquo;. </p>



<p>Lajcak denied any wrongdoing and condemned Epstein&#8217;s crimes in a statement, adding he was stepping down &ldquo;Not because I did anything criminal or unethical,&rdquo; but so that Fico &#8220;does not bear political costs for something unrelated to his decisions,&rdquo; according to local <a href="https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/bKHZDrO/miroslav-lajcak-konci-ako-poradca-pre-narodnu-bezpecnost-u-premiera-roberta-fica/#google_vignette"  target="_blank">Slovak</a> media.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Fico announced Lajcak&rsquo;s decision in a video statement on Facebook, praising him as &ldquo;a great diplomat.&rdquo; In light of calls from the opposition party for Lajcak to resign, Fico said that media coverage of the case has been &ldquo;hypocritical.&rdquo;`</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>India responds to email about Modi  </strong></h2>



<p>One email between Epstein and a &ldquo;Y. Jabor&rdquo;, in which he discussed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s relationship with the U.S. and Israel, prompted a response from the Indian government on Saturday.&nbsp; In the email, sent after Modi&rsquo;s 2017 visit to Israel, Epstein said that the prime minister &ldquo;danced and sang in Israel for the benefit of the US president.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Indian government <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/40641/Statement_by_the_Official_Spokesperson_to_clarify_certain_reports"  target="_blank">denied</a> Epstein&rsquo;s characterization of the visit. &ldquo;Beyond the fact of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s official visit to Israel in July 2017, the rest of the allusions in the email are little more than trashy ruminations by a convicted criminal, which deserve to be dismissed with the utmost contempt,&rdquo; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modi was the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel, and the trip was seen as a shift in relations between the two countries. Donald Trump was in his first term in office as president at the time.</p>

<p>The view from Iran&rsquo;s northwestern border was supposed to be magical. Instead, a decade ago, I saw desolate grasslands, just as the region&rsquo;s post-Soviet rulers intended. I had followed in my father&rsquo;s path. Years earlier, he convinced Soviet guards to let him wander among thousands of intricate <em>khachkars</em> (literally, cross-stones). Their carvings depicted daily life and biblical iconography. Beneath rested men and women whose <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/from-the-indian-ocean-to-the-mediterranean/paper"  target="_blank">diasporic</a> legacies include Europe&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Rich_Brew/cMA4DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22The%20first%20coffeehouses%20to%20operate%20in%20Vienna%20were%20opened%20by%20two%20ARmenians%22&amp;pg=PT90&amp;printsec=frontcover"  target="_blank">first coffeehouses</a>. This was <a href="https://julfaproject.wordpress.com/the-argam-ayvazyan-archive/"  target="_blank">Djulfa</a>. Until 2005, it stood as the world&rsquo;s largest medieval Armenian cemetery.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Last December marked 20 years since this sacred site&rsquo;s destruction, which my research&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZu2zqFE_gI"  target="_blank">born</a> in my late teens&mdash;<a href="https://hyperallergic.com/a-regime-conceals-its-erasure-of-indigenous-armenian-culture/"  target="_blank">exposed</a> as the finale of our time&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/01/monumental-loss-azerbaijan-cultural-genocide-khachkars"  target="_blank">greatest cultural genocide</a>. While I still draw on this erasure to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/sovereign-heritage-crime/57A43BF1C6599927BA5BBF7E41C763F6#element"  target="_blank">study</a> heritage and security, in 2025 I prioritized fatherhood over commemorating the anniversary&mdash;only to realize I&rsquo;d done both.</p>



<p>Five years earlier, as a new father in 2020, dreaming of speaking with my son had kept me going. He had heart surgery at birth, only to be readmitted due to a life-threatening virus. Then, amid the pandemic, my research on cultural destruction was suddenly everywhere as Azerbaijan launched a <a href="https://time.com/5902290/nagorno-karabakh-azerbaijan-armenia/" >war</a> in our ancestral homeland&mdash;fought in the shadow of erasures like Djulfa.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/UC-Irvine.jpg" alt="" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Lost in my 2020s multi-crises, I clung to future conversations with my son&mdash;until his speech delays became anxiety. Would I ever reach normalcy? Could I ever explain to him why places like Djulfa mattered?&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the summer before he turned five, I realized we were already communicating. Determined to break his screen fixation, I had been reciting a century-old poem around him. Surprisingly, he memorized every word. What followed became more than a pastime.</p>



<p>When my wife asked if there was an English translation, I couldn&rsquo;t find one that preserved the poem&rsquo;s daring wordplay. Its author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeghishe_Charents"  target="_blank">Yeghishe Charents</a>, wrote it in his early twenties, shaping Armenia&rsquo;s post-genocide identity. He died in the Stalinist purges, only to become the first vindicated Soviet intellectual, a new book <a href="https://iupress.org/9780253073556/anastas-mikoyan/"  target="_blank">reveals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a non-translator, I turned to those who knew the poem: my mother&mdash;who taught it to me as a child&mdash;mentors, and my son. He tested new compounds and repeated sounds like &ldquo;Nairian,&rdquo; derived from an ancient name for Armenia, as effortlessly as what he learned online. But not everything came easily. When the opening line forced me to choose between the biblical &ldquo;word&rdquo; and &ldquo;bounty&rdquo;&mdash;a single letter difference between two versions&mdash;I picked the one that smells like the apricots and mulberries of my childhood. The first verse emerged:</p>



<p><em>I love my sweet Armenia&rsquo;s sun-taste bounty,</em><em><br></em><em>Our ancient lute&rsquo;s wail-tone, crysome chord I love.</em><em><br></em><em>Blood-hued flowers&rsquo; and roses&rsquo; scent of burn,</em><em><br></em><em>And Nairian girls&rsquo; grace-lithe dance I love.</em></p>



<p>We refined the rest over the weeks. At playgrounds across Denver, my son invented a poem-game: I&rsquo;d swing him while reciting, first in Armenian, then in English, and eventually in &ldquo;mixed.&rdquo; The second verse flowed, partly echoing our adopted state&rsquo;s landscape:</p>



<p><em>I love our sky &ndash; dim, waters crystal, lake moonlit,</em><em><br></em><em>Sun of summer and the winter&rsquo;s dragon-voice gale sublime,</em><em><br></em><em>Lost-in-darkness huts&rsquo; uninviting walls &ndash; black,</em><em><br></em><em>And timeworn cities&rsquo; millenary stone I love.</em></p>



<p>As December neared, I thought again of Djulfa&rsquo;s 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Some of the worst things are done in the name of heritage, yet heritage is often the first target&mdash;hit where it hurts most, a warning of what might come next. Erasing a people never targets bodies alone; remembering is often all that remains. But were my university talks and writing enough to commemorate the loss that had launched my research? I was <em>as</em> anxious on the playground: What would others think of words like &ldquo;blood-burned&rdquo;? My son, on the swing, didn&rsquo;t care:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Be where I may, I shan&rsquo;t forget our sob-sound songs,</em><em><br></em><em>Forget I shan&rsquo;t our prayer-turned, iron-scripted books,</em><em><br></em><em>However keenly my heart is pierced by our blood-drained wounds,</em><em><br></em><em>Still &ndash; orphan and blood-burned my lover Armenia I love.</em></p>



<p>He claimed the poem as if it were his, paraphrasing&mdash;without knowing&mdash;what Charents had once <a href="https://www.foreversaroyan.com/images/HAYASTAN_AND_CHARENTZ_Armenian_Review_Winter_1954.pdf"  target="_blank">told</a> the playwright William Saroyan: It was quite enough to be Armenian; not everything had to be universal. But wasn&rsquo;t I confusing my child with a final verse&mdash;packed with a theologian saint, a medieval love poet, and a dual-named mountain&mdash;that I didn&rsquo;t fully understand myself? And was I about to burden him, once the time arrives, with Djulfa? Interrupting my thoughts, he recited, with thrill:</p>



<p><em>For my home-longing heart, there is no other tale.</em><em><br></em><em>No brow aglow like Narekatsi or Kuchak,</em><em><br></em><em>Cross the world, no height alight like Ararat.</em><em><br></em><em>Like reach-less glory&rsquo;s path &ndash; my Masis mount I love.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/A-replica-Djulfa-khachkar-at-the-Colorado-State-Capitol-a-memorial-to-all-crimes-against-humanity-courtesy-of-Simon-Maghakyan.jpg" alt="" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Communication, I used to think, meant relaying information. Yet I never had long conversations with my own father. Instead, over coffee, he would slip in stories like visiting Djulfa, unaware, ironically, of its caf&eacute; ties. The legacy didn&rsquo;t fade there. My son carries his name. The poem helped my son bridge generations, and me to show why heritage matters. In a way, we translated Charents, while Charents translated us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Translating did not just honor the loss that had sparked my research; it helped me understand the poem. Like Djulfa&rsquo;s <em>khachkars</em>, the poem blends the celestial with the earthly: Ararat becomes Masis, the biblical mountain&rsquo;s secular name, echoing the pairing of medieval poets of faith and of love. No wonder the poem has lived with two versions for a century. There was never a typo: &ldquo;word&rdquo; and &ldquo;bounty&rdquo;&mdash;the heavenly and the sensory&mdash;were meant to be interchangeable. After all, even in mundane moments, we exist on the sacred-everyday spectrum: My son&mdash;my co-translator&mdash;already knew this, nibbling on a sun-dried apricot as he murmured the poem. </p>



<p>Ultimately, translating with my son brought me some normalcy. Because in the end, we&rsquo;d done more than translate the most famous Armenian poem. We&rsquo;d reenacted an ancient ritual: the everyday parent-child interaction that creates a new language of love, one that neither of us can speak alone, or forget.</p>

<p>Two important things happened on January 20, 2025. In Washington, D.C., Donald Trump was inaugurated as President of the United States. In Hangzhou, China, a little-known Chinese firm called DeepSeek released R1, an AI model that industry watchers <a href="https://x.com/pmarca/status/1883640142591853011"  target="_blank">called</a> a &ldquo;Sputnik moment&rdquo; for the country&rsquo;s AI industry.<br><br>&ldquo;Whether we like it or not, we&#8217;re suddenly engaged in a fast-paced competition to build and define this groundbreaking technology that will determine so much about the future of civilization,&rdquo; said Trump later that year, as he announced his administration&rsquo;s AI action plan, which was titled &ldquo;Winning the Race.&rdquo;<br><br>There are many interpretations of what AI companies and their governments are racing towards, says AI policy researcher Lennart Heim: to deploy AI systems in the economy, to build robots, to create human-like artificial general intelligence. <br><br>&#8220;I think in most metrics, the U.S. is clearly leading,&rdquo; he says. But Heim notes that getting a clear picture of AI progress and adoption is challenging: &ldquo;The best metrics are the numbers we don&#8217;t have.&rdquo; <br><br>These six graphs show where the U.S. is ahead of China, what&rsquo;s driving that lead&mdash;and why it could be tenuous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right now, compute is arguably the single biggest driver of AI progress,&rdquo; says Daniel Kokotajlo, executive director of the AI Futures Project, a research group that forecasts the future of AI progress, referring to the computer chips used to train AI models.<br><br>That&rsquo;s bad news for Chinese firms, which have been limited in their access to compute&mdash;the chips used to train and run AI models&mdash;since 2022, when the Biden administration <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/13/2022-21658/implementation-of-additional-export-controls-certain-advanced-computing-and-semiconductor"  target="_blank">restricted</a> the export of the advanced manufacturing equipment used to produce the chips, and then the chips themselves in 2023.<br><br>&ldquo;Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/deepseek-ceo-interview-with-chinas"  target="_blank">said</a> Liang Wenfeng, CEO of DeepSeek in July 2024.<br><br>However, export rules <a href="https://www.bis.gov/press-release/department-commerce-revises-license-review-policy-semiconductors-exported-china"  target="_blank">announced</a> in January by the Trump administration could give Chinese companies access to 890,000 of Nvidia&rsquo;s H200 AI chips&mdash;more than double the number of chips that Chinese manufacturers are expected to produce in 2026, according to a <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/cnas-insights-unpacking-the-h200-export-policy"  target="_blank">report</a> by the Center for a New American Security. <br><br>&ldquo;Limited access to advanced chips has been the primary constraint on China&rsquo;s AI progress. The new export rule will significantly boost China&rsquo;s AI capabilities,&rdquo; Janet Egan, one of the report&rsquo;s authors, told TIME. &ldquo;The U.S. is essentially equipping its leading strategic competitor.&rdquo;<br><br>It remains to be seen whether the Chinese companies will be able to take advantage of the newly available chips&mdash;Chinese customs officials initially blocked imports of the chips, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-customs-agents-told-nvidias-h200-chips-are-not-permitted-sources-say-2026-01-14/"  target="_blank">report</a>s.<br><br>&ldquo;China has a lot of incentive to look like it might be blocking chips, both in terms of its relationship with Chinese tech companies, because it wants to force them to buy domestic chips, and in terms of its relationship with Washington, because it wants to make Washington think that it doesn&#8217;t need U.S. chips,&rdquo; says Chris Miller, author of <em>Chip War</em>, a bestselling history of the semiconductor industry.</p>

<p>The success of DeepSeek&rsquo;s R1 model was a sign of what can be achieved by a talented team with limited resources. A Stanford analysis found that more than half of the researchers responsible for the breakthrough &ldquo;never left China for schooling or work,&rdquo; challenging &ldquo;the core assumption that the United States holds a natural AI talent lead.&rdquo;<br><br>China produces far more top AI researchers than the U.S., according to an <a href="https://archivemacropolo.org/interactive/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/"  target="_blank">analysis</a> of authors at NeurIPS, a top AI conference. Many of them end up working in the U.S., but the share working in China more than doubled between 2019 and 2022, and a new $100,000 <a href="https://time.com/7319507/h1b-trump-tech-innovation-ai/" >price tag</a> on visas for foreign talent may further &ldquo;hurt the innovation and competitiveness of the U.S. industry,&rdquo; Subodha Kumar, a professor at the Fox School of Business at Temple University, told TIME last year.</p>

<p>AI training is incredibly power-hungry. U.S. AI companies have been falling over each other to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/climate/three-mile-island-reopening.html"  target="_blank">secure</a> <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/talen-amazon-aws-susquehanna-nuclear-data-centert/750440/"  target="_blank">contracts</a> <a href="https://blog.google/company-news/outreach-and-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/"  target="_blank">with</a> energy providers. <br><br>Chinese AI companies have a significant advantage in this regard. China has produced more energy than the U.S. since 2010. &ldquo;Of all the key inputs into AI, energy is the one where the U.S. is least competitive,&rdquo; says Miller. <br><br>For now, China&rsquo;s AI development is bottlenecked by its lack of AI chips, but if its stock increases&mdash;either through relaxed export controls of American chips, or through increased domestic production&mdash;the country&rsquo;s ready access to energy could be critical.</p>

<p><br>For the time being, America&rsquo;s control of AI chips and larger share of top talent has allowed it to produce the world&rsquo;s most capable large language models (LLMs). Chinese LLMs have lagged behind American models by seven months on average, <a href="https://epoch.ai/data-insights/us-vs-china-eci"  target="_blank">according</a> to Epoch AI, an AI research company. <br><br>Moreover, Chinese models&rsquo; competitiveness might be partly due to &ldquo;distillation,&rdquo; where developers use outputs from more capable models to train their own models, says Heim. Some users reported that Chinese firm DeepSeek&rsquo;s model <a href="https://x.com/giffmana/status/1872586401436627211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872586401436627211%7Ctwgr%5Eba2fd3c276bb290178c32b7e44ced3a4a119503d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F12%2F27%2Fwhy-deepseeks-new-ai-model-thinks-its-chatgpt%2F"  target="_blank">said</a> that it was &ldquo;ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI,&rdquo; when asked to identify itself.<br><br>&ldquo;Without distillation, I expect the gap in AI model performance would be bigger,&rdquo; Heim told TIME. </p>

<p><br>&ldquo;Revenue is people paying for things they find useful,&rdquo; says Miller. &ldquo;The best metric, I think, of AI deployment is the revenue that accrues to AI products.&rdquo;<br><br>Alibaba&mdash;which makes the Qwen series of models, among the most capable coming out of China&mdash;is publicly traded, and therefore is one of the country&rsquo;s few AI developers that also publishes revenue figures.<br><br>However, developing Qwen is a side hustle for the company&rsquo;s Cloud Intelligence division, which is the largest provider of web services in the country, making the group&rsquo;s revenue an upper bound on the money that the company makes on its AI models.<br><br>Even so, it&rsquo;s a figure that American AI startups&mdash;founded at least six years later and concentrated solely on AI development&mdash;are approaching rapidly.

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257982857.jpg" alt="WH Departure 1/27/26"/>



<p>President Donald Trump on Wednesday revived the threat of military action against Iran, declaring on social media that a &ldquo;massive armada&rdquo; of American forces was moving toward the country and warning &ldquo;time is running out&rdquo; for Tehran to agree to a deal limiting its nuclear program.</p>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115972658725010644"  target="_blank">post on Truth Social</a> early Wednesday, Trump said the show of force was intended to pressure Iran back to negotiations. &ldquo;Hopefully Iran will quickly &lsquo;Come to the Table&rsquo; and negotiate a fair and equitable deal &#8211; NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS &#8211; one that is good for all parties,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The President added that if Iran refused, the consequences would be severe, invoking last June&rsquo;s U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and warning that any future attack would be &ldquo;far worse.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>



<p>The comments came amid mounting tensions over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions, a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests, and an increasingly visible American military buildup in the Middle East, even as the precise scope of the &ldquo;armada&rdquo; Trump described remains unclear.</p>



<p>Iran&rsquo;s Mission to the United Nations <a href="https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/2016510869677461986?s=20"  target="_blank">warned</a> on social media that Washington was repeating the mistakes of past Middle East wars, saying that while Tehran was open to dialogue based on &ldquo;mutual respect and interests,&rdquo; it would defend itself forcefully if attacked. &ldquo;If pushed, it will respond like never before,&rdquo; the mission said.</p>



<p>Iranian officials have also publicly rejected negotiations under threat. Abbas Araghchi, Iran&rsquo;s foreign minister, told state media Wednesday that there had been no recent contact with U.S. officials and no Iranian request to restart talks. &ldquo;Negotiations don&rsquo;t go along with threats,&rdquo; he said, adding that talks could only resume if what he called &ldquo;menaces and excessive demands&rdquo; ended.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s remarks fit a familiar pattern. For weeks, he has suggested that he is prepared to use force against Iran, citing both its nuclear program and its violent suppression of protests that erupted late last year and spread nationwide. The demonstrations, sparked by economic distress and anger at Iran&rsquo;s clerical rulers, were met with a sweeping crackdown that activists say has killed thousands. Two senior officials with Iran&rsquo;s Ministry of Health recently told TIME that <a href="https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/" >as many as 30,000 people</a> could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has <a href="https://www.en-hrana.org/thirty-first-day-since-the-start-of-the-protests-continued-internet-blackout-first-court-hearing-held/"  target="_blank">reported</a> at least 6,221 deaths, with the vast majority having been protesters, while the United Nations&rsquo; special rapporteur on Iran has said the toll could be far higher. Iran&rsquo;s government has officially put the death toll at just over 3,000, describing many of the dead as &ldquo;terrorists.&rdquo; Independent verification has been difficult amid a prolonged internet blackout inside Iran.</p>



<p>Trump has previously drawn two red lines that could trigger U.S. military action: the killing of peaceful demonstrators and the mass execution of detainees. On Wednesday, however, his focus appeared to be squarely on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program, which he has repeatedly accused of being aimed at developing weapons.</p>



<p>Last June, after indirect nuclear negotiations collapsed, the United States joined Israel in a 12-day war with Iran, bombing three of the country&rsquo;s key nuclear facilities. Trump has since claimed that the strikes &ldquo;obliterated&rdquo; Iran&rsquo;s program, though international experts say critical questions remain, including the whereabouts of Iran&rsquo;s stockpile of highly enriched uranium.</p>



<p>Iran insists that its nuclear activities are strictly civilian and that it has the right to enrich uranium. It has also warned that any new U.S. attack would prompt retaliation against American bases and interests across the region, raising fears of a wider conflict.</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both close U.S. partners that host American forces, have said they will not allow their airspace to be used for attacks on Iran. Egypt and Qatar have moved to mediate, with senior officials holding calls with Iranian leaders and Trump&rsquo;s Middle East envoy in an effort to ease tensions.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Worlds-top-universities-2026-2.jpg" alt=""/>



<p>TIME, in partnership with <a href="https://r.statista.com/"  target="_blank">Statista R</a>, the leading global provider of market and consumer data and rankings, has published the inaugural edition of the &ldquo;<a href="https://time.com/7358185/top-universities-globally-2026/" >World&#8217;s Top Universities of 2026</a>&rdquo; ranking. The quantitative study highlights institutions that drive academic excellence globally.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Methodology</h1>



<p>This research project conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify top-performing universities worldwide. Eligibility criteria required institutions to be older than three years, offer bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, and enroll more than 2,000 students.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Universities were shortlisted if they met at least one of the following conditions:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>At least one of the highly cited researchers, according to <a href="https://clarivate.com/highly-cited-researchers/"  target="_blank">Clarivate</a>, is among their faculty, </li>



<li>They are among the most renowned and frequently mentioned institutions, or </li>



<li>They applied through the open call to action published on TIME.com.</li>
</ol>



<p>The analysis is structured around three key pillars: academic capacity &amp; performance, innovation &amp; economic impact, and global engagement. Institutions receive scores on each pillar, which are then aggregated into a final score used to produce the ranking.</p>



<p>The ranking acknowledges key limitations in global university comparisons. Given uneven reporting across countries, the Statista R team triangulated international, national, and university-supplied data to improve consistency. The study assesses many outputs relative to institutional inputs or country averages to reduce bias from differing contexts.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data comparability: </strong>A central challenge in global rankings is data comparability across regions and national contexts. Reporting practices often lack cohesion, even within countries. To address this, the Statista R research team employed triangulation, combining secondary data from global sources and national datasets with primary data from university reports and data submissions to verify collected information. To further reduce distortions arising from divergent reporting practices and regulations, output measures were evaluated relative to institutional inputs or to country averages. Through this approach, Statista R constructed a global ranking that assesses universities&rsquo; relevance within their respective contexts.</li>



<li><strong>Input and output: </strong>The study incorporates both input and output variables and, wherever feasible, evaluates outputs relative to inputs, considering not only absolute performance but also the resources required to achieve it. This approach aims to provide a more balanced view of the university landscape. In particular, the dimensions of academic capacity &amp; performance and innovation &amp; economic impact largely assess institutional impact in relation to inputs or institutional circumstances, while global engagement indicators capture universities&rsquo; international reach and positioning.</li>
</ul>



<p>Accordingly, the study incorporates regional and national factors to contextualize academic performance and account for institutional starting positions, extending beyond purchasing power parity (PPP) to include additional relevant factors.</p>



<p>The framework of academic capacity &amp; performance, innovation &amp; economic impact, and global engagement retains the classical components used in higher education assessments, such as the learning environment and academic output, while integrating measures of societal and economic impact and the international reach of institutions. </p>



<p>In addition, Statista R places particular emphasis on indicators that link universities to real-world innovation, labor-market outcomes, and internationalization. These pillars are operationalized through a broad set of quantitative indicators derived from global and national datasets as well as institutional submissions, which are normalized and aggregated according to a transparent weighting scheme. The three pillars are weighted as follows in the overall scoring model: 60% academic capacity &amp; performance, 30% innovation &amp; economic impact, and 10% global engagement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scoring for Academic Capacity &amp; Performance</h2>



<p>Under the pillar of academic capacity &amp; performance, the study examines both the resources universities devote to teaching and research, and the results they achieve in terms of scholarly output and academic excellence.</p>



<p>Within the resource and staffing coefficients, the study focuses on outputs that universities deliver for their students, relative to the resources available. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Resource expenditure per student, adjusted for regional differences and standardized using purchasing power parity (PPP). Data was collected from nationally available databases of statistical agencies and/or ministries of education for the respective countries and supplemented with official university documents, such as annual reports and financial statements.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research income per faculty member, adjusted for regional differences and benchmarked to the country context, capturing the funding available to generate research activity and support graduate supervision.</li>



<li>Institutional income, adjusted for regional differences, reflecting the overall financial resources of the university that underpin instructional capacity, student services, and research infrastructure.</li>



<li>Faculty-to-student ratio, measuring the number of students a faculty member could potentially supervise.</li>



<li>Staff-to-student ratios, where applicable, capturing broader instructional and support capacity.</li>
</ul>



<p>Data for these indicators was collected from nationally available databases and enriched with official university documents. Universities were also able to submit data through the project&rsquo;s reporting form. Submissions were cross-referenced during analysis. To mitigate regional or national reporting differences, universities were benchmarked relative to their own inputs and against country-level metadata. The resulting indicators were subsequently normalized at the global level.</p>



<p>Much of the analysis focuses on academic performance indicators, such as publication activity and citation impact, as well as the presence of highly cited researchers. Statista R incorporated additional data sources and contextualized results at regional and national levels.</p>



<p>The following academic impact indicators are used:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clarivate&rsquo;s list of highly cited researchers is used to determine the share of a university&rsquo;s faculty represented among the top researchers.</li>



<li>Citation counts are analyzed using the non-profit project Exaly, assessing institutional totals and indices (e.g., the h-index) from a perspective intended to reduce bias and relating results to faculty size and country context.</li>
</ul>



<p>To capture academic distinction at the highest level, the study also considers the presence of Nobel Prize and Fields Medal laureates among university alumni and staff.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nobel Prize laureates were identified via the official Nobel Prize website. Their curricula vitae were examined for institutional affiliations and alma mater. Results were contextualized by country performance and faculty strength.</li>



<li>Fields Medal laureates were identified via the official Fields Medal website. Their curricula vitae were examined for institutional affiliations and alma mater. Results were similarly contextualized.</li>
</ul>



<p>Citation data was sourced from global databases; no individual citation-level research was conducted by Statista R or TIME. Laureate CVs were researched individually by Statista R&rsquo;s research team.</p>



<p>Taken together, these indicators form a composite measure of academic capacity &amp; performance. In the overall scoring model, this dimension contributes 60% of the final score, with indicators within the dimension weighted according to the KPI framework defined in the accompanying scoring model.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scoring for Innovation &amp; Economic Impact</h2>



<p>Under the dimension of innovation &amp; economic impact, the study examines universities&rsquo; contributions to the advancement of science and technology, the diffusion of knowledge, and their influence on economic decision-making through the careers of their graduates.</p>



<p>For the innovation impact on technological advancement, Statista R cooperated with LexisNexis&reg; Intellectual Property Solutions to analyze the quantity and value of an institution&rsquo;s intellectual property portfolio. The scoring is based on the <em>Patent Asset Index</em> featured in <a href="https://www.lexisnexisip.com/solutions/ip-analytics-and-intelligence/patentsight/"  target="_blank">LexisNexis&reg; PatentSight+</a>. This coefficient accounts for the impact that technological and other developments under the authority of the university have on global industry.</p>



<p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) extend education to broad audiences beyond geographic and, in many cases, financial constraints. Many universities offer free and paid courses on these platforms, often without entry barriers. This set of indicators therefore evaluates universities&rsquo; contributions to global knowledge dissemination and to human capacity development for innovation via open-source courses and degree programs.</p>



<p>In addition, to assess the diffusion and external uptake of an institution&rsquo;s knowledge and services, we use the total traffic to the university&rsquo;s official web domain, normalized relative to country benchmarks, capturing the institution&rsquo;s digital reach of its research, innovation, and economically relevant activities among prospective students, partners, and other stakeholders.</p>



<p>One of the most challenging dimensions to assess is universities&rsquo; capacity to generate broad-based student outcomes beyond purely academic achievements. Outside academia, graduates influence economic decision-making and shape the societies in which we live.</p>



<p>Accordingly, the study examines the extent to which graduates attain positions of influence in business, thereby shaping the economy and everyday life. To do so:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Statista R conducted an extensive analysis of publicly available curricula vitae of top executive-level employees at companies listed on major global stock exchanges.</li>



<li>Researchers identified their alma maters using company disclosures and other public sources.</li>



<li>The results were then contextualized by institutional size (enrollment) and by regional benchmarks to assess the output of top-performing graduates relative to university scale and regional context.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the overall scoring model, the innovation &amp; economic impact dimension contributes 30% of the final score, aggregating indicators related to patents, open&#8209;education offerings, and graduate outcomes according to the KPI weights specified in the scoring model.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scoring for Global Engagement</h2>



<p>As a global ranking, the study evaluates the global engagement of universities by measuring the extent to which they attract international students and staff and the degree of international attention they receive.</p>



<p>A key indicator of internationalization is the proportion of international students enrolled at a university. Accordingly, the study examines both the share and number of international students, with particular attention to undergraduate enrollment.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The proportion of international undergraduate students and the overall proportion of international students are used to capture the internationality of the student body.</li>



<li>The proportion of international faculty is also a relevant indicator of an institution&rsquo;s global character and the internationality of its teaching environment.</li>
</ul>



<p>To assess international interest in each institution, Statista R looked at web metrics to evaluate how much traffic was on the university&rsquo;s website and how much of the traffic was driven by international users. This includes both total website traffic relative to country benchmarks and the geographic distribution of visitors.</p>



<p>These indicators are combined into a composite measure of global engagement. In the overall scoring model, this dimension contributes 10% of the final score, based on the indicator weights set out in the KPI framework.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final scoring</h2>



<p>Once the data are collected and evaluated, they are consolidated and weighted within a three&#8209;dimension scoring model. Each university&rsquo;s overall score is calculated as a weighted sum of normalized indicator scores, with dimension-level weights reflecting their relative importance in the framework.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Academic capacity &amp; performance &ndash; 60% of the overall score</li>



<li>Innovation &amp; economic impact &ndash; 30% of the overall score</li>



<li>Global engagement &ndash; 10% of the overall score</li>
</ul>



<p>Within each dimension, multiple indicators and sub-indicators are used (e.g., resource and staffing ratios, publication and citation indices, intellectual property measures, graduate outcomes, and internationalization metrics). These indicators are normalized and combined according to the detailed weighting scheme defined in the KPI overview and scoring model.</p>



<p>The 500 universities with the highest final scores are featured in the &ldquo;<strong><a href="https://time.com/7358185/top-universities-globally-2026/" >World&rsquo;s Top Universities of 2026</a></strong>&rdquo; ranking by TIME and Statista R.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sources</h2>



<p>The research underlying the World&rsquo;s Top Universities ranking draws on multiple data streams to enable triangulation and enhance validity wherever possible. Statista R relies on primary sources, including direct data submissions from universities via the application form and officially published institutional records such as annual reports and financial statements.</p>



<p>In addition, the study makes extensive use of secondary sources, including global databases and national datasets from statistical agencies and relevant ministries (e.g., ministries of education). These sources help ensure within-country comparability of reported data.</p>



<p>The reporting form was available online from June through August 8, 2025, and was announced via TIME.com as well as through an outreach mailing by Statista R to shortlisted universities. The call was open to all institutions, ensuring equal opportunity for participation and enabling universities to provide data crucial to the analysis.</p>



<p>Statista R and TIME strongly <strong>encourage all universities to participate in this reporting process</strong>, with a particular appeal to institutions in countries with <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/government-at-a-glance-2025_0efd0bcd-en/full-report/digital-public-infrastructure_1cee4220.html"  target="_blank">limited data infrastructure</a> to submit information through this outreach. Institutions may pre-register to receive further information <a href="https://www.statista.com/page/worlds-top-universities"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Statista R&rsquo;s research team conducted extensive analyses of university websites, annual reports, and financial statements to address data gaps and cross-check information from other sources. Data was collected through a combination of manual and automated methods, followed by a manual validation process performed by expert researchers at Statista R.

<p>Today&rsquo;s debate over the future of higher education is often framed as a choice between diversity and meritocracy, as if universities must choose between the identity and the quality of their students. But while that paradigm may fit easily into the extreme partisan politics of today, the real question may center on the role of wealth in the admissions process. What if we could design admissions policies that are more meritocratic <em>and</em> increase socioeconomic diversity?</p>



[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>The tension is reflected in TIME&#8217;s new ranking of the <strong>World&#8217;s Top Universities (listed below)</strong>. The ranking places emphasis on the extent to which students achieve extraordinary success, for instance in patenting new inventions or rising to leadership roles in business. These lists help us understand where students are likely to achieve the greatest success and contribute most to society as the world order shifts; U.S. and U.K. universities continue to lead in academic performance, while China&#8217;s universities are catching up in innovation and economic impact. But they also reveal an uncomfortable reality: in most countries, these top universities are most accessible to children from high-income families, limiting their socioeconomic diversity.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://time.com/7346375/worlds-top-universities-methodology-2026/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Methodology: How TIME and Statista Determined the World&#8217;s Top Universities of 2026</a></strong></p>



<p>Our own <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/collegeadmissions/"  target="_blank">research</a> using big data to study the outcomes of millions of college students over time underscores this point in the United States. Fewer than 1% of Americans attend the 12 &#8220;Ivy-Plus&#8221; colleges (the eight Ivy League schools plus Stanford, MIT, Duke, and the University of Chicago), yet they account for over 13% of those in the top 0.1% of earners, a quarter of U.S. Senators, half of all Rhodes scholars, and three-fourths of Supreme Court justices appointed in the last half-century.</p>



<p>These institutions don&rsquo;t merely select talented students but directly change their life trajectories. Comparing waitlisted students who were accepted vs. rejected from these institutions essentially by chance, we find that those who attend an Ivy-Plus college are far more likely to reach the top 1% of the income distribution, work at prestigious firms, and achieve success in many other dimensions. Selective colleges have extraordinary influence.</p>



<p>Because these institutions offer such a unique pipeline to leadership positions, it is important that they select students in ways that provide the broadest possible access within the most qualified students. For many, the primary justification for this priority is moral: there is perhaps no more widely shared principle than equality of opportunity, the belief that a child&rsquo;s opportunities should not depend on their family background, income, or ZIP code. </p>



<p>But even setting aside this principle, there is a powerful pragmatic case for diversity as well: nations grow faster when they tap into the broadest possible talent pool to contribute to society. No one benefits from excluding those who could have discovered new lifesaving drugs, started companies that innovate and grow the economy, or improved communities through creative work in government or the non-profit sector.</p>



<p>How do top universities fare in attracting talent from all backgrounds? Unfortunately, the data show that access for talented students from families outside the traditional &#8220;elite&#8221; is much more restricted than it ought to be. Our<a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/collegeadmissions/"  target="_blank"> research</a> on the <a>12 Ivy-Plus colleges </a>in the U.S.&mdash;all of which rank among TIME&rsquo;s<em> </em>top 60&mdash;shows that students from wealthy backgrounds are heavily overrepresented: more than 15% come from families in the top 1% of the U.S. national income distribution, who have incomes above $600,000 per year. </p>



<p>Data from other countries similarly bears this out; for instance, students from private high schools in the United Kingdom account for nearly half of those at Oxford and Cambridge (ranked no. 1 and no. 7 globally in TIME&rsquo;s new ranking) despite accounting for just 7% of all high school students. In Chile, students from elite private schools are 16 times more likely to enroll in the most selective programs at the nation&rsquo;s top universities (University of Chile, ranked no. 461, and Pontificia Universidad Catolica) than the average student. The pattern is clear: the world&rsquo;s most influential universities serve society&rsquo;s most privileged families.</p>



<p>One might imagine that the lack of socioeconomic diversity arises from meritocratic admissions practices. Some of the skew towards wealthy students does arise from differences in pre-college resources&mdash;such as the quality of schools children attend or the neighborhoods in which they grow up. But much of it arises purely from college admissions policies.</p>



<p>Consider two students who apply to college with an SAT score of 1500, one from a family in the top 1% and another from a middle-class family. The student from the high-income family is more than twice as likely to be admitted to an Ivy-Plus college as students from middle class families. A student whose parents are business executives are far more likely to be admitted to top-ranked colleges than a student with the same high school test scores and grades whose parents are teachers or bus drivers.</p>



<p>If students from the top 1% were admitted to Ivy-Plus schools at the same rate as middle-class students with the same SAT or ACT scores, the share of students from the top 1% at America&rsquo;s top colleges would fall by nearly half.</p>



<p>Three factors drive the high-income admissions advantage: legacy preferences, non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment. Applicants from top 1% families whose parents attended an Ivy-plus college (&ldquo;legacy applicants&rdquo;) are five times more likely to be admitted to an Ivy-Plus college than peers with comparable credentials whose parents did not attend. Students from high-income families also score higher on non-academic aspects of applications, largely because they are more likely to attend private high schools with greater access to extracurriculars, college counseling, and other support for the application process. Recruited athletes, who (perhaps surprisingly to many outside America) make up 10-15% of top American universities&rsquo; incoming students, also skew heavily toward high-income families who are able to hire the coaches and provide the support needed for students to excel in athletics.</p>



<p>One might be able to justify these admissions preferences if they helped universities find students with unusually high potential. But our data show just the opposite: these admissions advantages do not predict future success. Legacy students, those with higher non-academic ratings, and recruited athletes are no more likely&mdash;and often less likely&mdash;to reach top income levels, attend elite graduate schools, or work at prestigious companies than comparable Ivy-Plus applicants. By contrast, academic factors such as test scores and grades are highly predictive of post-college outcomes.</p>



<p>The bottom line is that the debate about meritocracy vs. diversity itself misses the point: When we measure merit by what predicts success&mdash;not by parental wealth&mdash;meritocracy can actually increase diversity. Admitting students to top-ranked colleges on the basis of their own merit would increase the representation of students from middle-class families on college campuses and expand the talent pool for businesses to hire. Top American universities that serve as gateways to leadership could <em>both</em> broaden access <em>and</em> strengthen meritocratic norms in admissions by focusing more heavily on indicators of academic potential and reducing preferences that primarily track family income. Eliminating legacy preferences, reducing the weight placed on non-academic factors such as extracurriculars and athletics, and being more transparent about admissions criteria would help move these institutions closer to a meritocracy while opening their doors to a wider group of students.</p>



<p>Expanding access to colleges that are pathways to success is particularly important in this era of growing mistrust of the establishment. Admissions policies that present non-meritocratic barriers to many students reinforce the perception that elite universities protect privilege instead of cultivating talent. This is not to say that diversity and academic merit will never be in tension in college admissions, especially given the large disparities in access to high-quality K-12 education and other resources before children apply to college. But for now, opening the gates of the world&rsquo;s top universities based on talent rather than family income stands to benefit everyone&mdash;not just graduates.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bangladesh-Tarique-Rahman-01.jpg" alt=""/>



<p>Tarique Rahman has lost his voice. That isn&rsquo;t ideal for the aspiring leader of Bangladesh, the South Asian nation of 175 million. It&rsquo;s also tinged with irony since, as his homeland&rsquo;s de facto opposition leader, Rahman&rsquo;s speeches had been banned from local media for a decade by autocratic former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>



<p>&ldquo;My body is getting adjusted to this local weather,&rdquo; says Rahman, speaking to TIME in the garden of his family home, resplendent with bougainvillea and marigolds, in his first interview since returning to his homeland after 17&nbsp;years in exile. &ldquo;The thing is that I&rsquo;m not very good at talking anyway,&rdquo; he shrugs, &ldquo;but if you ask me to do something, I try my best.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>It&rsquo;s been a whirlwind few weeks for Rahman, who arrived in Bangladesh on Dec. 25, greeted by hundreds of thousands of rapturous supporters who had waited throughout the night at Dhaka&rsquo;s airport. Just five days later, his mother, Bangladesh&rsquo;s first female Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, passed away following a long illness, drawing even larger numbers to throng the sprawling capital to pay their respects. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very heavy in my heart,&rdquo; says Rahman, eyes welling. &ldquo;But the lesson I learned from her is that when you have a responsibility, you must perform it.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bangladesh-Tarique-Rahman-02.jpg" alt="Rahman" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>That responsibility might be nothing less than following in her footsteps. Rahman is the clear front&nbsp;runner in Feb. 12 elections, which were called after Hasina&rsquo;s ouster in a student-led popular uprising 18 months ago. Rahman is positioning himself as a bridge between a political aristocracy that dates back to Bangladesh&rsquo;s liberation struggle and the aspirations of its young revolutionaries.</p>



<p>Many issues require swift remedy. Bangladesh suffers from high inflation and a weak taka currency, which combine to erode real incomes for ordinary households. Declining foreign reserves have led to import restrictions that undermine manufacturing and energy supplies. These headwinds impede efforts to diversify a national economy still reliant on garment exports and overseas remittances. With youth unemployment at 13.5%, and 2 million young Bangladeshis entering the workforce each year, there&rsquo;s a dire need to create opportunities for the next generation.</p>



<p>Yet Rahman comes with baggage. His chief credentials are dynastic&mdash;as the son of Zia and independence hero Ziaur Rahman, the 60-year-old represents the opposite branch of a feuding duopoly that has dominated Bangladeshi politics since its inception (Hasina being the daughter of founding President Sheikh Mujib).</p>



<p>To his supporters, Rahman is a persecuted redeemer returning to save his beleaguered homeland. To his detractors, he&rsquo;s a dark prince, a venal and entitled university dropout whose only leadership qualification is an accident of birth. Rahman insists he&rsquo;s the right person to heal his riven nation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m the son of my father and mother,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My party supporters are the reason why I&rsquo;m here today.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Bangladeshis appear willing to take him at his word. Opinion polls from late December showed support for his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) at around 70%, with its nearest challengers, the main Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, at 19%.</p>



<p>Yet anxiety is palpable. During the BNP&rsquo;s last stint in power from 2001 to 2006, Transparency International ranked Bangladesh the world&rsquo;s most corrupt country for four consecutive years. Reformists fear the blood of up to 1,400 slain protesters killed to unseat Hasina may produce another self-serving scion.</p>



<p>Rahman denies all corruption allegations, and his prior convictions were quashed by the courts. &ldquo;They have failed to prove anything,&rdquo; he says of his accusers. It&rsquo;s certainly true that Hasina&rsquo;s Awami League was aided by a compliant press that blindly parroted accusations against him. But it&rsquo;s equally true that Rahman is steeped in the same hereditary privilege that the July revolution railed against.</p>



<p>South Asia&rsquo;s second biggest economy is regularly the top single contributor to U.N. peacekeepers and also joins exercises with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The nation, one of the world&rsquo;s most densely populated, also hosts over 1 million Rohingya refugees fleeing genocide in war-torn neighboring Myanmar. The U.S. is the biggest source of foreign direct investment and the top destination for Bangladeshi exports, while the nation is moving into high-tech manufacturing, allowing international firms like Samsung to extricate supply chains from China. But Beijing also covets ties to Bangladesh, which offers strategic access to the Bay of Bengal that could mitigate any blockade scenario in the South China Sea.</p>



<p>The hope is that the institutional reforms started by the interim administration of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus deliver the necessary checks and balances to avert another lurch toward despotism. And, for that matter, that Rahman has undergone the necessary self-reflection and growth during his years in the political wilderness to truly become a leader for his people. </p>



<p>&ldquo;We have a very, very strong responsibility to those people who lost their lives,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We need to work together, unite, so that people can have their political rights.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<hr/>



<p>Rahman appears soft-spoken and introverted, preferring to listen rather than hold court. His favorite pastime in London was strolling around leafy Richmond Park, lost in his thoughts, or reading history books. His favorite film is <em>Air Force One.</em> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve probably seen it eight times!&rdquo; he reveals.</p>



<p>Rahman comes across as a policy wonk who can summon facts and figures on any issue. He wants to dig 12,000 miles of canals to help replenish a depleted water table, plant 50 million trees a year to combat land degradation, and seed 50 new green spaces in Dhaka to help the smog-wreathed capital breathe. He has plans to install trash-burning power generators, repurpose technical colleges to upskill migrant workers, and partner with private hospitals to alleviate an overwhelmed state health care system.</p>



<p>&ldquo;If I can implement just 30% of what I have planned, I&rsquo;m sure the people of Bangladesh will support me,&rdquo; he says.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a technocratic approach a world apart from Rahman&rsquo;s slippery reputation. He was born in Dhaka, where he attended an air force school before enrolling in the University of Dhaka in the mid-1980s. However, he failed to complete his international-relations degree, quitting during his second year. He subsequently went into business and then entered politics more formally in the 1990s, rising to become senior joint secretary general of the BNP. His growing influence as a power broker made him both a central figure in party strategy and a controversial one, with critics accusing him of corruption and undue interference in governance.</p>



<p>To many Bangladeshis, Rahman is still snidely known as Khamba Tarique, referring to an alleged corruption scandal whereby thousands of electricity poles, or <em>khamba,</em> were reportedly bought from an associate at inflated prices but never connected to the grid. Although Rahman steadfastly denies any impropriety, a leaked 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable branded him &ldquo;a symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics&rdquo; and noted his reputation for &ldquo;flagrantly and frequently demanding bribes.&rdquo;</p>



<p>During Bangladesh&rsquo;s 2007&ndash;2008 military-backed caretaker government, Rahman was imprisoned for 18 months on 84 charges including embezzlement, money laundering, and orchestrating a grenade attack on an Awami League convoy. He suffered torture in prison that caused spinal problems that still blight him today, and his departure to the U.K. was originally to seek medical treatment. &ldquo;If the winter is very cold, then I get back pain,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I see it as a reminder of the responsibility I have toward the people. I must give my best so that others do not suffer this kind of thing in the future.&rdquo; With his ailing mother detained in 2018 on corruption charges she claimed were politically motivated, Rahman became the BNP&rsquo;s acting chairman, directing party activities via video link from abroad.</p>



<p>For much of the intervening period, Bangladesh prospered. It became the Asia-Pacific&rsquo;s fastest growing economy, with GDP rising from $71 billion in 2006 to $460 billion in 2022. But the Awami League simultaneously became ever more repressive. Some 3,500 people were extrajudicially disappeared during the last 15 years of Hasina&rsquo;s reign, says the interim government, while every institution was politicized, engendering deep distrust of the military, courts, civil service, and especially security services. Independent journalists and civil society complained of surveillance and harassment.</p>



<p>Over time, economic indicators turned negative with costs, inequality, and youth unemployment all soaring. The July uprising began with peaceful demonstrations against employment quotas for regime loyalists, but Hasina&rsquo;s ham-fisted crackdown ignited a powder keg of fury against political repression that brought tens of thousands of teenagers and grandparents, professors and panhandlers, united onto the street.</p>



<p>As demonstrators bore down on Hasina&rsquo;s official residence in Dhaka, she fled in a military helicopter to India, where she remains with a cabal of confidants, railing against her ouster and the subsequent exclusion of her Awami League party from the upcoming elections. &ldquo;Electors have to be given the right to choose between alternatives,&rdquo; Hasina tells TIME. &ldquo;Until Bangladesh holds truly participatory elections that allow all major parties, there is no hope for democracy.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Hasina&rsquo;s complaining about eroded democracy is particularly rich to Rahman, given the sheer scale of bloodshed she presided over, with security forces turning armored vehicles on protesters armed with sticks and rocks, and even opening fire upon crowds from a helicopter. &ldquo;Whoever commits a crime, there are rules, there are laws in this country,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So they must get their punishment.&rdquo; In November, a war-crime tribunal decided that punishment would be death, were Hasina ever to return to Bangladesh.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bangladesh-Tarique-Rahman-03.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Yet the decision to exclude the Awami League is controversial. Sheikh Hasina&rsquo;s son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, recently told Reuters that party loyalists had been instructed to disrupt the vote. &ldquo;We will not allow elections without the Awami League to go ahead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our protests are going to get stronger and stronger&nbsp;&#8230;&nbsp;eventually there&rsquo;s probably going to be violence.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Unrest won&rsquo;t help win friends in Washington, where sporadic attacks on minorities were amplified by the Awami League as evidence that radical Islamists had seized control. Both the Awami League and influential Indians have been lobbying President Donald Trump to impose sanctions. More recently, the Trump Administration imposed &ldquo;reciprocal&rdquo; tariffs of 20% on Bangladesh, which has hit its export-reliant economy. Rahman says he&rsquo;s exploring ways to reduce the nation&rsquo;s trade deficit and negotiate a reprieve by potentially purchasing Boeing airplanes and U.S. energy infrastructure.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Donald Trump will look after the interests of his country,&rdquo; says Rahman. &ldquo;I will look after the interests of my country. But we can also help each other. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Trump is a very reasonable man.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<hr/>



<p>Mementos of the July revolution still festoon the Bangladeshi capital, where garish murals celebrate Hasina&rsquo;s ouster by depicting the dethroned autocrat with devil&nbsp;horns and surrounded by sacks of loot. Slogans proclaim: &ldquo;Shame on Bangladeshi Police!&rdquo; and &ldquo;This is a new Bangladesh made by Gen-Z.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;After July, people wanted the system to be changed, for the judiciary, bureaucracy, and police to be independent,&rdquo; says Hasnat Abdullah, a 26-year-old candidate for the fledgling National Citizen Party (NCP), spawned from the student protest leaders. Regarding Rahman, Abdullah is reserving judgment but likes what he&rsquo;s seen. &ldquo;Tarique Rahman is doing really well,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Leading a party like the BNP is really difficult. It&rsquo;s too early to comment on his performance, but so far he&rsquo;s doing great.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The jury is also out regarding the success of reforms. Just as those revolutionary murals have sun-bleached and blistered, so the heady jubilation of the students&rsquo; victory has become tarnished by infighting and division.</p>



<p>All political parties were excluded from the interim government, and as Yunus also had no government experience, the effort&rsquo;s leaders lacked institutional heft. Women were at the forefront of the uprising yet were largely sidelined in the interim government, heading just one of the six reform commissions: the Women&rsquo;s Affairs Reform Commission. But that was subjected to vulgar protests from Islamists who argued its recommendations for gender equality violated Shari&lsquo;a law. Its proposals were shelved.</p>



<p>There were some successes: a Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances examined 1,913 complaints and determined 1,569 had disappeared, of which 287 fell into the &ldquo;Missing and Dead&rdquo; category. (Nearly all were members of Jamaat or the BNP.) Despite pressure from the armed forces, suspects are tried in civilian court. Political discourse in Bangladesh has also opened up. Mubashar Hasan, an adjunct professor at Western Sydney University, who was extrajudicially detained for 44 days under Hasina, recalls how he recently took part in an open seminar to discuss the politicization of military, judiciary, and intelligence services. &ldquo;Afterward, I came home and slept in peace,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That was unthinkable during the Hasina period.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But at the same time, law and order has significantly eroded with a troubling spike in vigilante lynchings and mob violence, as well as the abuse and online doxing of women in particular. A nadir was reached on Dec. 12, when youth leader and election candidate Sharif Osman Hadi, a fierce critic of India&rsquo;s hosting of Hasina, was fatally shot by masked assailants in Dhaka. Following his death, a mob set fire to two leading newspaper offices in Dhaka they accused of being pro&ndash;New&nbsp;Delhi, trapping dozens of journalists on a rooftop as the flames licked higher. The perception is that the police and military don&rsquo;t feel empowered to fully discharge their duties given lingering public revulsion at their role in the July uprising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our first priority will be to ensure the rule of law,&rdquo; says Rahman. &ldquo;To make sure that people are safe on the street, safe to do business.&rdquo;</p>



<p>However, there&rsquo;s been little so far in terms of efforts to install the necessary guardrails to ensure abuses don&rsquo;t happen again. When they go to the polls to choose their new leader, Bangladeshis will also vote on a referendum on constitutional reforms, including establishing a bicameral legislature, sharing more power between the Prime Minister and President, allowing independent voting by lawmakers, and a prime-ministerial term limit of 10 years. A no vote &ldquo;would be very disappointing,&rdquo; says Ali Riaz, who headed the interim government&rsquo;s Constitutional Reform Commission. &ldquo;It would leave the country in a situation where it might actually go back to the past.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The decision to bar the Awami League from the ballot could also backfire if socioeconomic indicators don&rsquo;t improve&mdash;and fast. &ldquo;No election that excludes the country&rsquo;s largest and oldest political party can ever be considered free or fair,&rdquo; says Hasina. Riaz is unapologetic. &ldquo;This is a political party which perpetrated such heinous acts, which are basically crimes against humanity, yet they have not apologized for it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There is no remorse. Rather, they&rsquo;re inciting people.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Rahman won&rsquo;t be drawn out on whether excluding the Awami League was correct, but says in principle he doesn&rsquo;t like the banning of any political party. &ldquo;Because if you ban a political party today, what assurance do I have that tomorrow you will not ban me?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Of course, if someone is responsible for some kind of crime, they must face the consequences.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>While Rahman&rsquo;s return has injected optimism into Bangladesh, the most striking change postrevolution is resurgent Islamism. Bangladesh is a crucible boasting a Muslim population bigger than any Middle Eastern nation, with a sizable minority of around 10% Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and others. Although constitutionally secular, the country made Islam the state religion during a military dictatorship in 1988, with the resulting paradox providing fertile ground for radical fundamentalists.</p>



<p>For all her legion of faults, Hasina kept a lid on extremism and had even recognized a transgender-protection law. But one of the first actions the interim government took was to rescind a ban on Jamaat, the Islamist party, which today enjoys strong youth engagement owing to a canny social media strategy.</p>



<p>In September, Jamaat&rsquo;s student wing won a landslide victory for the first time in the Dhaka University elections&mdash;-traditionally considered a bellwether for the national mood&mdash;and also swept four other prominent universities. The NCP has also backed Jamaat, prompting dozens of mainly female leaders to quit in protest. Muntasir Rahman, an out gay LGBTQ-rights advocate, was removed from the NCP&rsquo;s central committee after a backlash from party conservatives. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very disturbing for women student leaders as well as all the minorities and young people who had faith in them,&rdquo; says Ho Chi Minh Islam, a Dhaka-based nurse and transgender-rights activist.</p>



<p>Jamaat has the goal of Shari&lsquo;a law in its constitution though has moderated its more radical rhetoric, rebranding itself &ldquo;anti-fascist,&rdquo; focusing on social welfare, and vowing to work with other parties. It has even nominated a Hindu candidate in one minority stronghold constituency. While critics say these changes are merely cosmetic, many ordinary Bangladeshis have been sold on the veneer of incorruptibility that comes from a theological under-pinning. In early January, Jamaat&rsquo;s leader even revealed he had held secret talks with a senior Indian diplomat&mdash;an unprecedented meeting unthinkable in the past. Rahman is unconcerned. &ldquo;People just want to get back to a democracy where they can speak freely, where they can express themselves,&rdquo; he says.</p>



<p>Repairing relations with India will be a priority for whoever takes power. Bangladesh is almost surrounded by the South Asian superpower, with their 2,500-mile shared border one of the world&rsquo;s longest, making India the primary land transit route for Bangladeshi goods and a major source of imports, including cotton, grains, fuel, industrial materials, and electricity. &ldquo;Guarding the interests of our people and country comes first,&rdquo; says Rahman, &ldquo;but then we will try to take relations further.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bangladesh-Tarique-Rahman-05.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>India&rsquo;s hosting of Hasina and amplification of pro&ndash;Awami&nbsp;League propaganda has made New Delhi the chief villain in the eyes of young Bangladeshis. &ldquo;Even someone like Tarique Rahman incurs sizable political risks by openly calling for an embrace of New Delhi,&rdquo; says Michael Kugelman, a senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s illustrative of profound generational shifts. Jamaat sided with Pakistan during the 1971 liberation war and against Bangladeshi independence, which New Delhi supported with funds, arms, and the lives of over 3,800 Indian soldiers. Yet for young Bangladeshis today, Jamaat represents the incorruptible while India is the mortal enemy.</p>



<p>This break from the past shows that Rahman cannot lean heavily on his family legacy. Today&rsquo;s Bangladeshis have no use for tales of heroism from half a century ago; what they desperately crave is a leader who listens, builds bridges, and strengthens institutions to project the stability and confidence vital for international investment. If economic doldrums continue, an assailed populace may look more fondly at Hasina&rsquo;s record. &ldquo;One can never rule out dynastic parties,&rdquo; says Kugelman, noting how the BNP looked &ldquo;dead and buried&rdquo; just two years ago. &ldquo;Even Sheikh Hasina may not be finished. She&rsquo;s not a factor now, but you can&rsquo;t rule her out down the road.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While Rahman is all too aware of corruption&rsquo;s corrosive effect, the danger for Bangladesh lies in the thousands of low-ranking BNP cadres who suffered under Hasina and believe they&rsquo;ve now earned the right to wet their beaks. Ensuring party discipline won&rsquo;t be easy. </p>



<p>There are signs that Rahman has learned from previous missteps. In May, he reposted a satirical cartoon lampooning himself and his mother, noting the need to &ldquo;respect fearless and objective reporting, even when it may not align with our agenda.&rdquo; At Zia&rsquo;s funeral, he pointedly declined to score political points by condemning her treatment under Hasina, instead calling for unity. In contrast with Hasina&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iron Lady&rdquo; persona, Rahman&rsquo;s is deliberately softer; his pet cat, Jebu, a magnificent ginger Siberian, went viral on social media after his arrival from the U.K.</p>



<p>Asked what he misses about his former life in London, Rahman doesn&rsquo;t hesitate. &ldquo;My freedom,&rdquo; he says, gazing up at the 10-ft. barbed-wire fence that surrounds his family home. &ldquo;When I came to this house, and saw all this security, I felt claustrophobic.&rdquo; Gone are the days of meandering to the neighborhood shops or spontaneously driving his Lexus up to Fort William to surprise his daughter Zaima on her descent from Ben Nevis. Getting his daily 10,000 steps will require creative planning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Rahman isn&rsquo;t grumbling; he&rsquo;s showing that his return was not on a whim, but fueled by purpose, a determination to better his people&rsquo;s lot. He reaches for a favorite film quote to drive home the point; not from <em>Air Force One,</em> but <em>Spider-Man:</em> &ldquo;With great power comes great responsibility,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I very much believe that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>President Donald Trump threatened to end U.S. support for Iraq if Nouri Kamal al-Maliki returns to power, the latest intervention in another country&rsquo;s politics by an Administration that campaigned on extricating the U.S. from foreign entanglements.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115968824541011312"  target="_blank">posted</a> on Truth Social on Tuesday. &ldquo;Because of his insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq and, if we are not there to help, Iraq has ZERO chance of Success, Prosperity, or Freedom. MAKE IRAQ GREAT AGAIN!&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Al-Maliki was nominated to be Prime Minister by the largest Shia Muslim bloc in the Iraqi parliament on Saturday. Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, the country&rsquo;s outgoing Prime Minister, suspended his bid for a second term in office earlier this month, clearing the field for al-Maliki to step into the role. Al-Sudani&rsquo;s bloc won the largest share of seats in the country&rsquo;s parliamentary elections last November but fell short of a governing majority. The Coordination Framework, a coalition of Shiite parties with close ties to Iran and which acts as the kingmaker for the premiership, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iraq-prime-minister-sudani-maliki-government-cf3291c8325f5e31ebb1a42f2d0c2825"  target="_blank">reportedly</a> could not choose between the two candidates and left it to them to decide.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s threat puts Iraq in a bind, as it has long navigated a delicate balance between the U.S. and Iran&mdash;its two closest allies who have a tense relationship with each other. If Trump chose to cut U.S. support for Iraq, he could start with restricting the country&rsquo;s access to its oil revenues, which are held at the New York Federal Reserve.</p>



<p>The warning comes after the U.S. has tried for months to curb Iranian influence in Iraq. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with al-Sudani over the phone on Sunday with the view of &ldquo;ensuring that Iraq can fully realize its potential as a force for stability, prosperity, and security in the Middle East.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;A government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq&rsquo;s own interests first,&rdquo; the State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/01/secretary-rubios-call-with-iraqi-prime-minister-mohammed-shiaa-al-sudani-3"  target="_blank">readout</a> of the call said.</p>



<p>Trump, who campaigned on an isolationist &ldquo;America First&rdquo; platform, has increasingly intervened in other countries&rsquo; affairs. The Trump Administration began the year with a <a href="https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/" >raid on Venezuela</a>, capturing the country&rsquo;s leader Nicolas Maduro, <a href="https://time.com/7343084/venezuela-trump-run-rubio-maduro-regime-change-oil-military-leader/" >asserting U.S. control</a> over the country&rsquo;s oil reserves, and pressing the <a href="https://time.com/7343035/delcy-rodriguez-venezuela-president/" >new leadership</a> to govern in line with Washington&rsquo;s demands. Trump has also escalated economic pressure on allies, <a href="https://time.com/7357333/carney-trump-row-united-states-canada-relationship/" >threatening Canada</a> with <a href="https://time.com/7358254/mark-carney-davos-speech-trump-approval-polls/" >100% tariffs</a> over its business dealings with China and hitting Europe with <a href="https://time.com/7347120/greenland-trump-protests-tariffs/" >new tariffs</a> before <a href="https://time.com/7355850/trump-greenland-deal-tariffs-davos/" >backing down</a> amid resistance to his <a href="https://time.com/7344147/greenland-denmark-trump-takeover-independence-purchase-military-nato/" >territorial ambitions in Greenland</a>. Earlier this month, Trump also <a href="https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/" >threatened to intervene</a> in Iran in support of <a href="https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/" >anti-regime protestors</a>, just months after he <a href="https://time.com/7296013/trump-strike-iran-war-regime-change/" >bombed Iran&rsquo;s nuclear facilities</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is Al-Maliki?</h2>



<p>Al-Maliki was the first Prime Minister to hold office under Iraq&rsquo;s new constitution in 2006 as a leader within the Shiite Islamic Dawa Party. Iraq is a Shia-majority country. At the time, al-Maliki was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-we-stuck-with-maliki--and-lost-iraq/2014/07/03/0dd6a8a4-f7ec-11e3-a606-946fd632f9f1_story.html"  target="_blank">backed</a> by the George W. Bush Administration.</p>



<p>He rose to prominence after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2006/07/27/5581690/nouri-al-malikis-rise-to-leadership"  target="_blank">decades in exile</a> in Iran and Syria after fleeing Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s crackdown on Shiite opposition groups in the late 1970s. He returned to Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion toppled Saddam, served as a key negotiator for the Shiite alliance in the drafting of the country&rsquo;s constitution, and positioned himself as capable of restoring order in a country fractured by insurgency.</p>



<p>When al-Maliki came to power in 2006, Iraq was in the midst of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite factions, including the bombing of al-Askari Mosque months before he assumed premiership. During his first term from 2006 to 2010, the U.S. deployed around 30,000 additional troops as part of a &ldquo;surge&rdquo; aimed at suppressing insurgent violence and stabilizing Baghdad. Al-Maliki, alongside the U.S., supported the Sunni tribal &ldquo;<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26469091?seq=1"  target="_blank">Anbar Awakening</a>,&rdquo; a grassroots movement in which local leaders turned against al-Qaeda in Iraq. Those efforts, combined with security operations against both Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias, weakened al-Qaeda between 2007 and 2009, allowing al-Maliki to consolidate power.</p>



<p>Critics, <a href="https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/06/IRAQ-SECURITY%3AMALIKI.pdf"  target="_blank">including the U.S.</a>, blamed al-Maliki for <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2026/1/25/what-al-malikis-return-would-mean-for-iraq-and-the-region"  target="_blank">eroding the post-2003 promise of inclusive politics</a>.&nbsp; Al-Maliki carried out <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/iraq-back-on-the-brink-malikis-sectarian-crisis-of-his-own-making/"  target="_blank">sectarian policies</a> under the banner of de-Baathification, which was originally designed to sideline Saddam loyalists. Al-Maliki&rsquo;s government increasingly excluded Sunni Arabs from political life, including <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2010/01/de-baathification-as-a-political-tool-commission-ruling-bans-political-parties-and-leaders"  target="_blank">barring nine parties and over 450 candidates</a> from running in the 2010 parliamentary elections, overseeing the <a href="https://understandingwar.org/research/middle-east/weekly-iraq-update-51/"  target="_blank">arrests</a> of <a href="https://understandingwar.org/research/middle-east/warrant-for-iraq-vp-hashemis-arrest-and-coerced-confessions/"  target="_blank">prominent Sunni politicians</a> by security forces, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/24/iraq-investigate-deadly-raid-protest"  target="_blank">suppressing peaceful protests</a>. Critics have also <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/09/29/failing%20oversight.pdf"  target="_blank">accused</a> him of entrenching <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/19/how-maliki-ruined-iraq/"  target="_blank">corruption</a>, weakening public services, and expanding his control over the judiciary and security forces.</p>



<p>By 2014, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/iraqi-military-breakdown-fueled-by-corruption-politics-idUSKBN0EO2FK/"  target="_blank">years of corruption and sectarian politics</a> had hollowed out the army, contributing to its rapid collapse when the Islamic State (ISIS), an extremist Sunni jihadi group, seized large swaths of northern Iraq. Al-Maliki <a href="https://time.com/3112412/iraqs-embattled-prime-minister-agrees-to-step-down/" >ultimately stepped down</a> in the face of intense pressure from Iraqi politicians and the U.S.</p>



<p>Now, 75, al-Maliki has remained a key power broker within the Coordination Framework, leads the State of Law Coalition, a Shiite political alliance, and has maintained close ties with Tehran-backed factions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is the U.S. pressuring Iraq?</h2>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s warning on Tuesday is the latest in a sustained pressure campaign to constrain Iranian influence in Iraq&mdash;with the country&rsquo;s oil as a key point of leverage. Iraq&rsquo;s oil export revenue has largely been held at the New York Federal Reserve Bank as part of arrangements put in place after the 2003 U.S. invasion.</p>



<p>The Trump Administration has threatened senior Iraqi politicians with sanctions on Iraq if Iran-backed armed groups are included in the next government, sources told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-control-oil-dollars-heaps-pressure-iraq-over-iranian-influence-2026-01-23/"  target="_blank">Reuters</a> last week. In a letter to Iraq, which an Iraqi source confirmed to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/27/iraq-presidential-vote-delayed-as-kurdish-blocs-struggle-to-pick-candidate"  target="_blank">Al Jazeera</a>, U.S. representatives said that while choosing the Prime Minister is up to Iraq, &ldquo;the United States will make its own sovereign decisions regarding the next government in line with American interests.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Iran has ties to al-Maliki, but also <a href="https://researchonline.lse.ac.uk/id/eprint/105768/4/Iran_in_Iraq.pdf"  target="_blank">across Iraq&rsquo;s political spectrum</a>, including with numerous Shiite parties, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/profiles-irans-militia-allies-iraq"  target="_blank">militia leaders</a>, and senior officials. Iran has also long considered its neighbor an economic lifeline as it faces U.S. sanctions. For years, Washington has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/five-iraqi-banks-be-banned-us-dollar-transactions-sources-2025-02-16/"  target="_blank">tried to restrict</a> Iran&rsquo;s use of Iraq&rsquo;s banking system to skirt sanctions, although it has never targeted the flow from the New York Fed to Iraq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rep. Joe Wilson (R, S.C.) expounded on the Trump Administration&rsquo;s demands on X shortly after Trump&rsquo;s post.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Under President Donald J Trump the position of the United States is clear and unequivocal,&rdquo; Wilson <a href="https://x.com/RepJoeWilson/status/2016297488068522301"  target="_blank">posted</a> on Tuesday. Wilson said any Iraq government would need to &ldquo;place Iraq and its people first&rdquo; by fully disarming and dismantling all Iran-linked militia groups within 12 months, and remove all Iranian advisers, operatives and agents from the country.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Iranian influence in Iraq will no longer be tolerated,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The era in which outside actors imposed prime ministers on Iraq is over.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICE-Olympics.jpg" alt="Previews - Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics"/>



<p>The news that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will aid security operations in the upcoming Milan Cortina Olympics has sparked outrage among current and former Italian leaders.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a militia that kills,&rdquo; Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala told Italian media outlet RTL Radio 102, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ice-milan-cortina-olympics-immigration-enforcement-us-110fa4b2066e1fb920dba2a71c3a89e0"  target="_blank">The Associated Press</a>. &ldquo;A militia that enters into the homes of people, signing their own permission slips. It is clear they are not welcome in Milan, without a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed to TIME on Tuesday that ICE agents will support U.S. security operations at the Winter Games, which are being held in Milan and Cortina D&rsquo;Ampezzo from Feb. 6-22.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries,&rdquo; McLaughlin said in a statement. &ldquo;At the Olympics, ICE&rsquo;s Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State&rsquo;s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations. All security operations remain under Italian authority.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Federal agents have participated in U.S. security operations in previous Olympic Games, and some Italian leaders appeared to be unfazed by the prospect of ICE officers serving in such a role at the Milan Cortina Games.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be clear: it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re coming to maintain public order in the middle of the streets,&rdquo; Antonio Tajani, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, told the country&rsquo;s radio station RAI, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/27/europe/italy-ice-agents-security-olympics-intl"  target="_blank">CNN</a>. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming to collaborate in the operations rooms.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But other leaders, including Sala, were sharply critical of the news, citing the growing controversy surrounding ICE&rsquo;s operations in the U.S. Earlier this month, an ICE agent <a href="https://time.com/7344506/minneapolis-ice-shooting-mayor/" >shot and killed</a> <a href="https://time.com/7345200/ice-shooting-border-patrol-minneapolis-portland-renee-good-luis-moncada-yorlenys-zambrano-contreras/" >Renee Nicole Good</a>, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and mother of three, in Minneapolis. Less than three weeks later, in the same city, federal agents <a href="https://time.com/7357547/minneapolis-shooting-ice-agent/" >shot and killed</a> <a href="https://time.com/7357687/alex-pretti-ice-minneapolis/" >Alex Pretti</a>, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and registered nurse.</p>



<p>&ldquo;After street violence and killings in the USA, we now learn from their spokesperson that ICE agents will come to Italy for security at the Milan-Cortina Olympics,&rdquo; former Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte <a href="https://x.com/GiuseppeConteIT/status/2016094309360022008"  target="_blank">said</a> in a post on X on Tuesday. &ldquo;We cannot allow this.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Conte called on the country&rsquo;s current government&mdash;led by <a href="https://time.com/7304882/giorgia-meloni-interview/" >Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni</a>, one of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s closest allies in Europe&mdash;to &ldquo;set our own boundaries&rdquo; and &ldquo;make clear decisions.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Sala told RTL Radio 102 that he didn&rsquo;t think ICE agents should come to the Games &ldquo;because they don&rsquo;t guarantee they&rsquo;re aligned with our democratic security management methods,&rdquo; according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/27/europe/italy-ice-agents-security-olympics-intl"  target="_blank">CNN</a>. He suggested that Italian leaders push back on the Trump Administration.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Could we ever say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to Trump?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about severing relations or creating a diplomatic incident, but could we say &lsquo;No?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Carlo Calenda, an Italian politician, told RTL Radio 102 that ICE officers &ldquo;must not set foot in Italy,&rdquo; according to CNN.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It is a violent, unprepared, and out-of-control militia,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Following a heated <a href="https://time.com/7357333/carney-trump-row-united-states-canada-relationship/" >back-and-forth</a> between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, support for the Canadian leader has swelled, while Trump&rsquo;s already-underwater approval has further declined.</p>



<p>Without explicitly naming Trump, Carney denounced &ldquo;American hegemony&rdquo; and declared a &ldquo;rupture&rdquo; in the old world order during a headline-grabbing speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos that appeared to make pointed reference to the current U.S. Administration. The words sparked ire from Trump, who told an audience at Davos that &ldquo;Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, next time you make your statements.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>But Carney has rejected that assertion and said he stands by what he said in Switzerland&mdash;and his pushback against Trump appears to have resonated with the Canadian public.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://angusreid.org/federal-politics-carney-receives-post-davos-bump-in-approval/"  target="_blank">poll released by the Angus Reid Institute</a>, a Canadian nonprofit research group, on Monday found that Carney&rsquo;s approval among Canadians has jumped eight points to 60 percent, his highest rating yet since taking over as Prime Minister in March.</p>



<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/7357405/mark-carney-davos-speech-climate-energy/" ><em>The Climate and Energy Implication Hidden in Mark Carney&rsquo;s Davos Speech</em></a></p>



<p>Though the same poll shows that Carney&rsquo;s Liberal Party with only a narrow lead in support over the opposing Conservative Party, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s personal brand has been given a boost by his hardline foreign policy stance in the face of mounting U.S. threats, and could play into voters&rsquo; decisions moving forward.</p>



<p>The polling comes as Carney has reiterated the stance he laid out in his Davos speech after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that the Canadian leader had &ldquo;aggressively&rdquo; retracted some of the comments while speaking with Trump.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I was in the Oval [Office] with the president today,&rdquo; Bessent <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6388356389112"  target="_blank">said Monday on Fox News&rsquo; <em>Hannity.</em></a> &ldquo;He spoke to Prime Minister Carney, who was very aggressively walking back some of the unfortunate remarks he made at Davos.&rdquo;</p>



<p>On Tuesday morning, though, Carney denied this outright: &ldquo;To be absolutely clear &mdash; and I said this to the president &mdash; I meant what I said in Davos. It was clear,&rdquo; Carney told reporters on Parliament Hill. &ldquo;Canada was the first country to understand the change in U.S. trade policy that he had initiated, and we&rsquo;re responding to that.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Still, Carney said he had a &ldquo;very good conversation&rdquo; in a Monday phone call with Trump, who has targeted both Canada and the prime minister with a number of moves in the wake of Carney&rsquo;s speech. In addition to his remarks at Davos, Trump has criticized a Canadian trade agreement with China and threatened 100% tariffs on the U.S.&rsquo;s Northern neighbor if the deal went ahead and disinvited Carney from his Gaza &ldquo;Board of Peace.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Carney reiterated on Tuesday that though his country is open to negotiating a relationship with the U.S., Canada needs to stay the course in shifting away from trade dependency with America.</p>



<p>While Carney&rsquo;s domestic approval has surged amid the tensions between the two leaders, Trump&rsquo;s has slipped further this week.</p>



<p>New <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-immigration-approval-drops-record-low-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-01-26/"  target="_blank">polling</a> out Monday from Reuters/Ipsos found that Trump&#8217;s overall approval fell to 38%, tied for the lowest rating he has received since entering his second term in the White House. The decline in overall support came alongside a particular negative shift in Americans&rsquo; view of Trump&rsquo;s aggressive immigration crackdown after <a href="https://time.com/7345319/ice-shootings-renee-good/" >two civilians </a>were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis in recent weeks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The poll found that Americans&rsquo; approval of the job Trump is doing on <a href="https://time.com/7357923/abolish-ice-polls-minneapolis-shootings-alex-pretti-renee-good-trump-immigration/" >immigration</a> fell from 41% earlier this month to 39%, a new low during his second Administration, while 58% of Americans feel that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is going &ldquo;too far.&rdquo;</p>

<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7358249"></div></div>
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module video-2" data-src="https://time.com/7358249/doomsday-clock-midnight/" data-widget-id="SB_4" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1459101668.jpg" alt="Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists Announce New Doomsday Clock Time For 2023"/>



<p>Atomic scientists on Tuesday set the 2026 &ldquo;Doomsday Clock&rdquo; to 85 seconds to midnight, the closest it&rsquo;s ever been to a theoretical annihilation.</p>



<p>Familiar risks to human existence such as nuclear weapons and climate change were cited by the scientists, along with new technologies like artificial intelligence, which they argued is being used to spread disinformation. This is the <a href="https://time.com/5769610/doomsday-clock-100-seconds/" >third time</a> that the clock has been moved closer to midnight in the past five years.   </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;Every second counts, and we are running out of time. It is a hard truth, but this is our reality,&rdquo; President and CEO of Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist Alexandra Bell said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7329758/nuclear-weapons-test-us-russia-war-trump-xi-putin-missiles/" ><em>After Russia Conducts Nuclear Weapons Tests, Trump Announces U.S. Will Restart Its Own</em></a></p>



<p>The &ldquo;Doomsday Clock&rdquo; is a symbolic time set by the <a href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/"  target="_blank">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a> that represents how close humanity is to destroying our own world through disruptive technologies. It was created in 1947 during the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union were heading into a nuclear arms race in full force. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Doomsday-clock.gif" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The scientists underscored the significance of AI technology and how it&rsquo;s used to supercharge disinformation. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa said during the announcement that the world is living through &ldquo;informational armageddon&rdquo; thanks to the development of social media and generative AI, neither of which is &ldquo;anchored in facts.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Human beings have been commodified by a predatory and extractive industry,&rdquo; Ressa said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientists also noted the recent conflicts between nuclear-armed states and called on the Trump Administration to reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation by reengaging with Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The New START Treaty, the last remaining treaty that would limit all Russian deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, is set to expire on Feb. 4 without a clear signal that it will be renewed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, Putin suspended all inspections and treaty-mandated data exchange in 2023 over the war in Ukraine, but has expressed interest in restarting nuclear arms talks in 2025. Trump has not responded to Putin&rsquo;s offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a piece of low-hanging fruit that the Trump Administration should have seized months ago,&rdquo; Science and Security Board member Jon B. Wolfsthal said, while adding that both countries could reach an agreement as soon as &ldquo;today.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Bell added that although the Trump Administration has issued policies on multiple fronts that tipped the clock closer to midnight, leaders around the world have failed egregiously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;No matter the government, a shift toward neo-imperialism, an Orwellian approach to governance would only serve to push the clock toward midnight,&rdquo; she said.</p>



<p>Although the problems the world faces can feel overwhelming, Bell said they are human-made and still solvable. </p>



<p>&ldquo;There is not a single elegant solution for any of the problems that we are facing, but these problems are solvable,&rdquo; Bell said. &ldquo;Every time we&rsquo;ve been able to turn back the hands of the clock, it&rsquo;s been because we have scientists and experts working to find solutions, and the public was demanding action.&#8221;</p>

<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7358175"></div></div>
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/7358175/china-us-ai-race/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2244643579.jpg" alt="TOPSHOT-CHINA-TECHNOLOGY-XPENG-AI"/>



<p>It was a controversy laced with pride for He Xiaopeng. In November, He, the founder and CEO of Chinese physical AI firm XPeng, had just debuted his new humanoid robot, IRON, whose balance, posture shifts, and coquettish swagger mirrored human motion with such eerie precision that a slew of netizens accused him of faking the demonstration by putting a human in a bodysuit.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>To silence the naysayers, He boldly<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YExd152QcDY"  target="_blank"> cut open</a> the robot&rsquo;s leg live on stage to reveal the intricate mechanical systems that allow it to adapt to uneven surfaces and maintain stability just like the human body. &ldquo;At first, it made me sad,&rdquo; He tells TIME in his Guangzhou headquarters. &ldquo;The robot is like our classmate, our child. But later, I was proud.&rdquo;</p>



<p>There&rsquo;s plenty to be proud about across China&rsquo;s burgeoning AI industry these days. Despite significant headwinds, such as restrictions on Nvidia&rsquo;s most advanced GPUs, China&rsquo;s core AI industry was estimated at $160&ndash;$170 billion last year. China has more than 5,300 AI enterprises and leads the world in GenAI patenting, with six times as many registered as the U.S.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a turnaround. When ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in late 2022, policymakers in Beijing were aghast. But then last January, an obscure AI startup named DeepSeek released a generative AI platform, R1, which was comparable to ChatGPT but purporting to use just a fraction of Nvidia&rsquo;s bleeding-edge chips. Although those claims are<a href="https://time.com/7210888/deepseeks-hidden-ai-safety-warning/" > hotly contested</a>, R1&rsquo;s debut sent markets reeling and frissons through Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>DeepSeek also sparked a rush of AI investment in China, spotlighted by the rise of six AI unicorns&mdash;StepFun, Zhipu AI, Moonshot, Minimax, 01.AI, and Baichuan&mdash;which became known as China&rsquo;s &ldquo;AI Tigers&rdquo; as the nation&rsquo;s cities and regions clamored to seed a local champion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the &lsquo;tiger&rsquo; thing came from,&rdquo; MiniMax CEO Yan Junjie tells TIME with a chuckle. &ldquo;We just continue to advance our model to increase our revenue share and serve our global audience better.&rdquo;</p>



<p>MiniMax grew to prominence with low-cost AI video generation, though today boasts multimodal models that rank favorably across text, video, or audio benchmarks. But Yan doesn&rsquo;t see his competition as with the other tigers&mdash;DeepSeek&rsquo;s Liang is a friend, he says&mdash;but undercutting the industry behemoths. &ldquo;The battle really lies with the big tech giants&mdash;not just the Chinese ones, but globally.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While the common perception is that America leads the AI race, with its advanced AI models, chips, and private investor cash, China has its own advantages. These include a massive cohort of engineers and STEM graduates, lower costs, and a state-led development model. &ldquo;The idea that China does not have a technology industry is lunacy,&rdquo; says Nvidia CEO <a href="https://time.com/7341061/jensen-huang-time-person-year-interview/" >Jensen Huang.</a> &ldquo;Why would we underestimate such an extraordinary country?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Moreover, while policymakers in Washington have repeatedly<a href="https://www.energy.gov/em/articles/manhattan-project-20-bradburne-lays-out-em-vision-support-nuclear-renaissance-ai-race"  target="_blank"> alluded</a> to a &ldquo;Manhattan Project&rdquo; pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)&mdash;human-level cognitive abilities to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across virtually any intellectual task&mdash;China is more focused on diffusing AI across society.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think about AGI a lot,&rdquo; says<a href="https://time.com/5107485/baidus-robin-li-helping-china-win-21st-century/" > Robin Li</a>, founder and CEO of Baidu, one of China&rsquo;s foremost full-stack<a href="https://time.com/collection/time100-ai/6310648/robin-li/" > AI companies</a>. &ldquo;We are training our models, but the reason we train our model is to solve our application problems. I don&#8217;t think we should come up with a similar super smart AI that can be everything for everyone.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Not that China is shy about its AI ambitions. In August, Beijing <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/09/ai-china-90-percent-economy-why-wont-work?lang=en"  target="_blank">unveiled</a> its AI+ Initiative, which grandiosely aims no less than to &ldquo;reshape the paradigm of human production and life,&rdquo; with AI to be integrated into 90% of China&rsquo;s economy by 2030. Hot on the heels of AI+ came the latest draft of China&rsquo;s 15<sup>th</sup> five-year plan, which sets ambitious targets to achieve &ldquo;independent and controllable&rdquo; innovation to upgrade its economy and slip the U.S. technological noose.</p>



<p>These goals are underpinned by a wholesale revamping of China&rsquo;s scientific and innovation ecosystem, strengthening project-based funding for researchers, reorienting the education system toward STEM, while incentivizing private companies to spend more on basic research with whopping tax breaks. Already, semiconductor R&amp;D has tax relief of 120%&mdash;for every $1 million a firm spends on chip development, they deduct $1.2 million from their taxable income&mdash;and the draft suggests this could increase to 200%.</p>



<p>China&rsquo;s presumptive position at AI&rsquo;s vanguard marks a seismic shift. For decades, China relied heavily on resourceful harvesting of American IP for all its tech ambitions. Many of China&rsquo;s hitherto top names in AI&mdash;including ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, Xiaomi cofounder Lin Bin, and Alibaba CTO Wang Jian&mdash;cut their teeth at the Microsoft Research Asia (MRSA) lab in Beijing.</p>



<p>However, four companies founded by former MSRA staff&mdash;SenseTime, Megvii, Yitu Tech, and CloudWalk Technology&mdash;have been sanctioned by the U.S. for their roles in the mass surveillance and repression of China&rsquo;s Muslim ethnic minorities in what Amnesty International has<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/"  target="_blank"> dubbed</a> a &ldquo;dystopian hellscape.&rdquo; In addition, Xiao Rong, president of the U.S.-sanctioned Shenzhen Intellifusion, which provides facial recognition technology to Chinese police, worked at MSRA for over 10 years.</p>



<p>Under pressure from Washington, Microsoft has drastically<a href="https://techwireasia.com/2025/08/chinese-engineers-to-be-removed-from-microsoft-outsourcing-teams/"  target="_blank"> reduced</a> its China operations. Instead, a new generation of self-taught Chinese AI visionaries are moving fast and breaking things. Upon launching DeepSeek&rsquo;s V2 model in April, Liang pointedly crowed to Chinese media that its development &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t include anyone returning to China from overseas&mdash;they are all local. The top 50 experts might not be in China, but perhaps we can train such talents ourselves.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Not least when the mighty Chinese state provides lavish support. With dominance of AI now a core government policy, every city and region is offering incentives to AI start-ups. In Shanghai&rsquo;s eastern Pudong district, humanoid robots firm Agibot enjoys tax- and rent-free premises as well as many other perks. Agibot shipped 1,000 units in 2024 and aims for 10,000 this year, when co-founder and CTO Peng Zhihui expects to move into profit with 30% of revenue coming from overseas.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Because Shanghai is a major manufacturing city&mdash;Tesla has its factory here&mdash;we have very solid strengths in supply chains,&rdquo; Peng tells TIME. &ldquo;And there are many top universities in Shanghai, so we can get high-quality talent in AI and robotics.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Like DeepSeek&rsquo;s Liang, Peng has never studied overseas, first joining OPPO&rsquo;s AI Lab before a stint with telecoms giant Huawei and then co-founding Agibot in early 2023. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been my dream since childhood to build a humanoid robot,&rdquo; says Peng. &ldquo;I know many top [Chinese] entrepreneurs dropped out from Stanford University, but I think the best thing in business is to discover issues from the real world.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/time-AI-Peng-Zhui-Agibot.jpg" alt="PENG ZHIHUI His startup AgiBot builds robots that stack shelves, fold clothes, and pour tea. He says Chinese AI is boosted by the country&Otilde;s &Ograve;supply chains and manufacturing strengths.&Oacute;" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>In echoes of how the U.S. overtook the U.K. and Germany following the last industrial revolution, real-world adoption may determine the race for AI dominance. Until China can close its hardware deficit regarding GPUs, its ambitions will hinge on whether it can undercut Western competitors with embodied AI platforms to supercharge diffusion.</p>



<p>That goes for the models, too. MiniMax is focusing on offering comparable services to OpenAI at around one tenth of the cost, with Yan noting how many users in South or Southeast Asia would balk at the $200 monthly subscription cost for ChatGPT Pro. Yan says minimizing outgoings and attracting a broad customer base is the surest route to success at a time when many U.S. companies have bottomless pockets for R&amp;D&mdash;raising fears of an AI bubble.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Being a sustainable business is definitely very important,&rdquo; says Yan. &ldquo;Our Capex and R&amp;D costs are significantly lower compared to our U.S. counterparts, so for us it&#8217;s easier to achieve sustainable status.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not just the developing world that sees the benefits of China&rsquo;s low-cost approach. So does Silicon Valley. In October, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky revealed he was ditching ChatGPT for Alibaba&rsquo;s Qwen, praising the Chinese model as &ldquo;fast and cheap.&rdquo; That same month, Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya disclosed that his investment firm preferred Moonshot&rsquo;s Kimi K2 as &ldquo;a ton cheaper&rdquo; and &ldquo;way more performant&rdquo; when pitted against American models.</p>



<p>Up until now, the U.S. had far outpaced China when it comes to diffusing general purpose technologies throughout an economy, which typically takes multiple decades. The question is whether the same dynamics will apply to AI. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a difference between demonstrated capabilities on isolated benchmarks and actual integration with improving business productivity,&rdquo; says Jeffrey Ding, author of <em>Technology and the Rise of Great Powers: How Diffusion Shapes Economic Competition.</em> &ldquo;The U.S. is very well positioned, but it&#8217;s going to be a diffusion marathon.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>China&rsquo;s determination to break free of the U.S. stranglehold on chips is no secret. While the Trump Administration recently brokered a carve-out for Nvidia to export its second-most powerful H200 chips to Chinese firms, Reuters now <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-suppliers-halt-h200-output-after-china-blocks-chip-shipments-ft-reports-2026-01-17/"  target="_blank">reports</a> that Beijing is blocking their import&mdash;presumably to boost demand for homegrown equivalents like Huawei&rsquo;s Ascend 910C, which offers around 76% of the H200&#8217;s processing power and two-thirds of its memory bandwidth. Huawei has also launched CloudMatrix 384, a China-based AI system to rival Nvidia&rsquo;s GB200 NVL72 but built using homegrown chipsets.</p>



<p>In November, Baidu also unveiled its latest M100 AI chips and plans to build a supernode capable of supporting &ldquo;millions&rdquo; of chips by 2030. Still, Li is candid about China&rsquo;s progress in semiconductors&mdash;saying that China is still &ldquo;a few years&rdquo; behind on chips though fast catching up with regard to models. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m not so worried about the restrictions on chips, although I&rsquo;d very much like to get access to the most advanced Nvidia chips.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Those Nvidia chips are, of course, fabricated by TSMC predominantly in Taiwan&mdash;the self-ruling island that China claims as a renegade province and whose &ldquo;reunification&rdquo; President Xi Jinping has called a &ldquo;historical inevitability.&rdquo; In a May speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said a Chinese invasion of the democracy of 23 million &ldquo;could be imminent.&rdquo; Beijing is certainly honing its capabilities with AI at the fore.</p>



<p>In September, Beijing&rsquo;s Tiananmen Square hosted China&rsquo;s biggest ever military parade to mark 80 years since Japan&rsquo;s surrender in World War II. After striding to the rostrum flanked by North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Xi watched as an AI-enabled inventory of advanced weaponry filed past, including smart tanks, robot dogs and wolves, and lasers designed to thwart the kind of autonomous drone swarms currently terrorizing Ukraine. &ldquo;AI features very prominently in Chinese military strategy,&rdquo; one former PLA officer tells TIME.</p>

<p>The peerless role TSMC plays in global supply chains has been dubbed a &ldquo;silicon shield&rdquo; that raises the cost of a Taiwan conflict to prohibitive levels, estimated at $10 trillion by Bloomberg Economics, or some 10% of global GDP. Whether the current push to homeshore semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S. weakens that shield is a huge question&mdash;not least since Nvidia began fabricating its latest Blackwell chips in TSMC&rsquo;s Arizona plant in October. Still, &ldquo;the vast majority of manufacturing will still be done in Taiwan,&rdquo; says Nvidia&rsquo;s Huang. &ldquo;We have redundancy, we have diversity, but there&#8217;s no question we&rsquo;ll be dependent on Taiwan for a long time.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Until China manages to compete with Taiwan on chips, or forcibly brings the island to heel, Beijing hopes to steal a march on Washington through frontier AI applications. Last March, China&rsquo;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and civil-aviation and transport regulators released a six-year plan for the low-altitude economy, exploring regulations for aerial tolls, pilot licenses, and establishing trial areas where early-stage eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles) can fly around actual city environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other than humanoid robotics, Xpeng is due to roll out its first commercial eVTOL in the third quarter of 2026. For less than 2 million RMB (approximately $280,000) customers receive a six-wheeled hybrid AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier that contains a self-deploying six-propeller drone, which seats two adults and can be either piloted or flown autonomously for up to 45 minutes. New regulations had to be introduced for every step, from the number of wheels on the landing module to charging certification and even a bespoke pilot qualification. &ldquo;We cannot deliver this product without laws and regulations,&rdquo; says He. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we had cross ministerial meetings. Overall, it has been very effective.&rdquo;</p>



<hr/>



<p>Still, China isn&rsquo;t content to merely play catch up. The office of Zhu Song-chun feels more fitting for an 18th-century philosopher than globally renowned AI professor. It occupies an island within a sun-dappled ornamental lake in Peking University, whose campus was once an imperial garden, blanketed with crabapple blossoms in spring and ginkgo leaves in the fall. Guests seeking an audience with Zhu must hop across polished stepping stones&mdash;but once they do, they will incongruously find one of the world&rsquo;s foremost futurists, into whose research the U.S. once poured $30 million in federal grants.</p>



<p>Zhu was born in China during the bedlam of &ldquo;Great Helmsman&rdquo; Mao Zedong&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution. In 1992, he moved to the U.S. for his doctorate at Harvard and later ran one of the world&rsquo;s most prolific AI research centers at UCLA. For a decade, he undertook AI projects for the Pentagon and the U.S. National Science Foundation. But in August 2020, Zhu took up professorships at two top universities in Beijing, where he also leads the state-sponsored BigAI institute, which today boasts 300 researchers fixated on realizing AGI.</p>



<p>Zhu points to many reasons for his abrupt homecoming, including the first Trump Administration&rsquo;s 2018 China Initiative, which investigated hundreds of prominent Chinese-American academics for alleged espionage, with some 250 losing their jobs. Trump 2.0&rsquo;s assault on learning institutions writ large has done nothing to convince Zhu he erred by returning to China. &ldquo;Actually, they&#8217;re not only going against Chinese people [but] the whole of academia,&rdquo; says Zhu. &ldquo;If I stayed in UCLA right now, it&#8217;s pretty miserable, because I don&#8217;t have top students, I don&#8217;t have a lot of funding. And I&rsquo;ve got so many big ideas.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Chief among them is a revolutionary new cognitive architecture for AI. Zhu posits that the &ldquo;big data, small task&rdquo; approach of LLMs like ChatGPT will never achieve true intelligence, instead championing a &ldquo;small data, big task&rdquo; variant that better mimics human learning. Big data models learn by copying existing actions&mdash;how to fold clothes, write a dissertation, or create a video of a pig hoverboarding through space&mdash;by parsing previous examples and extrapolating similar behavior.</p>



<p>&ldquo;But you can only solve tasks on that data set, so therefore it&rsquo;s not intuitive, and does not generalize to other tasks,&rdquo; Zhu tells TIME. &ldquo;We have an infinite level of tasks to solve, so it does not contribute to true intelligence.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Indeed, this pabulum<strong> </strong>only scratches the surface, argues Zhu, who in keeping with his scholastic digs has burrowed deep down into the very core of human identity: our genetic disposition to like certain shapes, tastes, and odors; our ability to learn and be influenced by the community; and our motivation to build relations with others, especially with shared interests.</p>



<p>By mimicking these parameters, Zhu created an AI model, dubbed TongTong, which exists in a virtual city with her own drives, motivations, and limited autonomy. Rather than simply learning via existing data or repetition&mdash;a token or statistical chain&mdash;TongTong learns via a causal one: If I choose one chair over another, what factors lie behind that decision? Is it the chair&rsquo;s comfort, position far from a draft, or close to a friend. And at an even higher level, what value chain lies behind that choice: disliking hard surfaces, chilly breezes, or valuing company? &ldquo;Large language models stay at a token level,&rdquo; says Zhu. &ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t necessarily know the causality.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Regulation is another area where China is trying to get an upper hand. While the U.S. operates a negative regulatory environment, whereby everything is legal unless explicitly banned, China has a positive regulatory environment, with only explicitly described commercial activities permitted. A hands-off regulatory approach may seem like a boon for American companies, but in practice it means a lot of lawsuits and bickering when unleashing AI applications in the real world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take autonomous driving: Uber sold off its self-driving business in 2020 after a fatal collision. Ford abandoned its stake in its robotaxi developer Argo AI two years later. In 2023, GM paused all its Cruise driverless operations, despite already plowing in $10 billion, following collisions that led to the suspension of California licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By contrast, Baidu&rsquo;s Apollo Go robotaxis have completed over 17 million rides globally&mdash;the most in the world&mdash;and 250,000 rides per week, neck and neck with Alphabet&rsquo;s Waymo. But while the U.S. firm&rsquo;s 1,000 vehicles operating in San Francisco occupies around a quarter of the city&rsquo;s total ride-hailing market, Apollo Go has the same number ferrying passengers around China&rsquo;s central city of Wuhan&mdash;but comprising just 1%, spotlighting vaster potential to ramp up and hone operations while exploiting economies of scale. China&rsquo;s ride-hailing companies are already competing overseas; all three of China&rsquo;s leading robotaxi firms&mdash;Apollo Go, WeRide, and Pony.ai&mdash;operate in the UAE and vie for market share in Europe and beyond.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Whether other companies are also in a foreign market isn&rsquo;t really a factor for us,&rdquo; says James Peng, CEO of Pony.ai, which runs robotaxis across China, Europe, East and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. &ldquo;Rather we look at the market potential, the size, and how fast can the regulatory framework be ready.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Zhu can&rsquo;t help shaking his head when he sees the amount of cash the big Silicon Valley firms are plowing into AI but without, he says, a true understanding of the fundamental technology. Exhibit A: a company like DeepSeek can create its V3 model for $6 million, whereas Meta has plowed tens of billions of dollars into AI with few tangible results.</p>



<p>&ldquo;A lot of these big guys who bet on AI, like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk, I don&#8217;t think they have a deep understanding,&rdquo; says Zhu, reeling off the various distinct fields such as computer vision, robotics, cognitive reasoning, natural language understanding, multiagent systems, and machine learning that all require their distinct expertise. &ldquo;AI is such a big area you need to really immerse yourself into it for many, many years.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But despite his breathless pursuit of AGI, Zhu still says that it will be realized by a gradual diffusion throughout industries rather than the sudden &ldquo;boom&rdquo; breakthrough akin to the Manhattan Project.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our big advantage is we can work with many local governments and industries,&rdquo; says Zhu. &ldquo;I can go to see a governor, the minister, and big CEOs to try to apply our technology quietly. To let TongTong improve the agents used in hospitals or the factory monitoring systems.&rdquo;</p>



<p>TongTong&mdash;which Zhu claims already has the reasoning abilities equivalent to a six-year-old&mdash;has already proved more intuitive than big data models, using tools to solve problems and collaborating with peers without explicit instruction. The next step will be to move TongTong from the virtual to real world. &ldquo;TongTong today is a system software,&rdquo; says Zhu. &ldquo;Of course, they can put it into a robot to become hardware. And then finally to new AGI chips that can replace Nvidia GPUs. That&rsquo;s the key thing in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Athletes from across the world are descending upon northern Italy in preparation of the<a href="https://time.com/7346932/winter-olympics-watch-2026-schedule-milano-cortina/" > 2026 Winter Olympic Games.</a> Most will be competing under their nation&rsquo;s respective flags when the competition starts on Feb. 6, but that won&rsquo;t be the case for those hailing from Russia and Belarus.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>Olympic hopefuls from those eastern European countries will instead compete as Individual Neutral Athletes. (In French, they are referred to as Athletes Individuels Neutres&mdash;AIN.) The International Olympic Committee (IOC) describes this category as consisting of &#8220;athletes with Belarusian or Russian passports who have been confirmed as eligible and invited to compete.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The neutrality clause came into play after Russia&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6150708/russia-ukraine-invasion-war/" >full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. </a>Russian and Belarusian athletes and sports teams have been restricted from competing at numerous events and competitions following the assault, including Wimbledon in 2022 and the upcoming <a href="https://time.com/7338971/world-cup-draw-fifa-2026/" >FIFA World Cup.</a></p>



<p>Ahead of the highly-anticipated Milano-Cortina Winter Olympic Games, here&rsquo;s what you need to know about how Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why are Russia and Belarus banned by the IOC?</strong></h2>



<p>Following Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, the IOC&rsquo;s Executive Board <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-eb-recommends-no-participation-of-russian-and-belarusian-athletes-and-officials"  target="_blank">recommended</a> that athletes from both Russia and Belarus be banned from competing at Olympic events. Belarus was included in the recommendation <a href="https://time.com/6151347/belarus-russia-ukraine/" >due to its support</a> of Russia&rsquo;s assault.</p>



<p>The sports governing body <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-eb-recommends-no-participation-of-russian-and-belarusian-athletes-and-officials"  target="_blank">emphasized</a> that the decision came with a &ldquo;heavy heart&rdquo; as &ldquo;the Olympic Movement is united in its sense of fairness not to punish athletes for the decisions of their government if they are not actively participating in them.&rdquo;</p>



<p>This announcement came just a week after the conclusion of the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/sport-events/beijing-2022-winter-olympic-games"  target="_blank">2022 Winter Olympics</a> in Beijing, ahead of the 2024 Olympics in Paris 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2023, the IOC <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/statement-on-solidarity-with-ukraine-sanctions-against-russia-and-belarus-and-the-status-of-athletes"  target="_blank">expressed its support</a> for the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes that would participate in competitions as &ldquo;neutral athletes&rdquo; and &ldquo;in no way represent their state or any other organisation in their country,&rdquo; as long as they adhered to a particular set of guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their participation was confirmed <a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/News/2023/03/Participation-for-Individual-Neutral-Athletes-Personnel-with-a-Russian-or-Belarusian-Passport.pdf"  target="_blank">later</a> that year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ain-tenis-medals-paris-aug4.jpg" alt="Tennis - Olympic Games Paris 2024 - Day 9" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What rules are in place for Individual Neutral Athletes? </strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://stillmed.olympics.com/media/Documents/News/2023/03/Participation-for-Individual-Neutral-Athletes-Personnel-with-a-Russian-or-Belarusian-Passport.pdf"  target="_blank">Olympic guidelines</a> state that AINs can only participate at events under titles that display no relation to Russian or Belarusian national olympic committees or federations.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/individual-neutral-athletes-to-compete-at-milano-cortina-2026-olympic-winter-games-under-same-conditions-as-for-paris-2024"  target="_blank">Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel (AINERP)</a> assesses each competitor&rsquo;s eligibility. Those invited to participate under AIN must follow <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/individual-neutral-athletes-to-compete-at-milano-cortina-2026-olympic-winter-games-under-same-conditions-as-for-paris-2024"  target="_blank">strict guidelines</a>, including anti-doping regulations. Notably, athletes shown to be in support of Russia&rsquo;s invasion are not eligible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Athletes or support personnel contracted to the military or national security of either nation are also unable to participate under AIN. No emblems, logos, or flags can be shown or worn by adult AIN athletes. The AIN symbol and flag&mdash;a white circle inscribed with &ldquo;AIN&rdquo; on a teal background&mdash;must be used instead. These rules also extend to national anthems.</p>



<p>But the guidelines are somewhat different for youth competitions.</p>



<p>The IOC <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/olympic-summit-reaffirms-athletes-fundamental-rights-to-access-sport-without-political-interference"  target="_blank">announced</a> in December that youth athletes from both countries &ldquo;should no longer be restricted in their access to international youth competitions, in both individual and team sports.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The standard protocols of the IF [International Federation] or the International Sports Event Organiser regarding flags, anthems, uniforms and other elements should apply, provided that the national sports organisation concerned is in good standing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>This renewed approach will be put into play at the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/dakar-2026"  target="_blank">Dakar Youth Olympics</a>, set to start in Senegal in October.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who are the Russian and Belarusian competitors taking part in the Winter Games as neutral athletes?</strong></h2>



<p>Russian figure skaters Petr Gumennik and Adeliia Petrosian, alongside Belarusian Viktoriya Safonova will be taking part in the Milano-Cortina games. They will join Russian ski mountaineer Nikita Filippov and short-track speed skaters Ivan Posashkov and Alena Krylova.</p>



<p>Russians Savelii Korostelev and Daria Nepriaeva, as well as Belarusian Hanna Karaliova, will all compete in cross-country skiing.</p>



<p>The speed skating category will see Russians Kseniia Korzhova and Anastasiia Semenova take to the ice, as well as Belarusian Marina Zueva.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which prominent Russian and Belarusian athletes won&#8217;t be competing at the Winter Games?</strong></h2>



<p>As a result of the ban, prominent Russian players within the National Hockey League (NHL) will not be competing in the Milano-Cortina games. </p>



<p>Nikita Kucherov, Andrei Vasilevskiy, and Artemi Panarin&mdash;who all play for U.S.-based hockey teams&mdash;are among those who will miss another Olympics.</p>



<p>All-time NHL goal scorer Alexander Ovechkin, captain of the Washington Capitals, will also be notably absent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How many medals did AIN athletes from Russia and Belarus win in the 2024 Paris Olympics?</strong></h2>



<p>Belarusian trampoline gymnasts <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-trampoline-all-results-as-ivan-litvinovich-becomes-first-man-of-his-discipline-to-clinch-back-to-back-olympic-titles"  target="_blank">Ivan Litvinovich</a> and <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/viyaleta-bardzilouskaya"  target="_blank">Viyaleta Bardzilouskaya</a> went home with medals, winning gold and silver, respectively.</p>



<p>Belarusian rower <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/yauheni-zalaty"  target="_blank">Yauheni Zalaty </a>won silver and <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/yauheni-tsikhantsou"  target="_blank">Yauheni Tsikhantsou</a> earned a bronze in weightlifting.</p>



<p>Russian tennis players <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/mirra-andreeva"  target="_blank">Mirra Andreeva</a> and <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/diana-shnaider"  target="_blank">Diana Shnaider</a> claimed silver in the women&rsquo;s doubles.</p>



<p>(World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, has held to a harder line: no Russian or Belarusian track and field athletes competed at the 2024 Paris Olympics.)  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ain-weightlifting-paris-aug10.jpg" alt="Weightlifting - Olympic Games Paris 2024: Day 15" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happened to the Russian Olympic Committee?</strong></h2>



<p>The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) previously represented athletes from the country at prior games. Following a three-year investigation from the IOC into Russia&rsquo;s athlete <a href="https://time.com/4421019/russia-olympic-doping-report/" >doping scandal</a>, Russia <a href="https://time.com/5051287/russia-ban-winter-olympics/" >was banned</a> in 2017 from participating in the Winter Olympics.</p>



<p>After several discussions, it was decided that Russian athletes would still<a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-suspends-russian-noc-and-creates-a-path-for-clean-individual-athletes-to-compete-in-pyeongchang-2018-under-the-olympic-flag"  target="_blank"> be able to compete</a>, but only under the title of Olympic Athlete from Russia (OAR). Athletes wore a neutral uniform with the Olympic flag, and the Olympic anthem was played during their medal ceremonies.</p>



<p>After Russian athletes at the 2018 Winter Olympics passed their anti-doping tests, the ROC was reinstated. Athletes competed at the 2020 <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/tokyo-2020/medals"  target="_blank">Summer Olympics in Tokyo</a> and the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/beijing-2022/medals"  target="_blank">2022 Winter games</a> in Beijing under the Russian name.</p>



<p>But the <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-executive-board-suspends-russian-olympic-committee-with-immediate-effect"  target="_blank">ROC was banned</a> from competing entirely in October 2023<strong>, </strong>after it announced it would include sports organisations in captured Ukrainian territory under its own authority. The IOC said the move constituted &ldquo;a breach of the Olympic Charter because it violates the territorial integrity of the NOC [National Olympic Committee] of Ukraine.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can Russia participate in the Olympics in 2028?</strong></h2>



<p>Russia&rsquo;s goal is to compete under the Russian flag come the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.</p>



<p>&ldquo;An important event we all are striving for is the 2028 Olympic Summer Games, which will be held in the U.S. We are preparing to participate in full composition,&rdquo; said Sports Minister and ROC head <a href="https://olympic.ru/en/news/lenta/full-fledged-return-to-the-international-arena-is-a-key-priority-for-russian-sports-says-michael-degtyarev/"  target="_blank">Mikhail Degtyaryov</a> in September.</p>



<p>IOC President Kirsty Coventry, <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/kirsty-coventry-elected-ioc-president-the-first-female-president-in-ioc-history"  target="_blank">appointed last year</a>, has also floated the possibility of Russia being reinstated ahead of 2028.</p>



<p>Coventry said that she found inconsistencies with Russia&rsquo;s ban, pointing to conflicts in Africa that have not led to the suspension of countries involved. Coventry <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/athletes/kirsty-leigh-coventry"  target="_blank">won two gold medals</a> in swimming at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics for Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>&ldquo;What I would like to do is set up a task force&hellip; to set out some policies and some guiding frameworks that we as the movement can [use] to make decisions when we are brought into conflicts,&rdquo; she <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/incoming-ioc-president-to-open-talks-on-russias-potential-return-to-olympics-13333288"  target="_blank">said</a> in an interview. &#8220;We have conflicts in Africa and they&#8217;re horrific at the moment. So this is not going away, sadly.&rdquo;</p>



<p>TIME has contacted the IOC for comment.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26024696324323.jpg" alt="Chain of lights against the Iranian government"/>



<p>As many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone, two senior officials of the country&rsquo;s Ministry of Health told TIME&mdash;indicating a dramatic surge in the death toll. So many people were slaughtered by Iranian security services on that Thursday and Friday, it overwhelmed the state&rsquo;s capacity to dispose of the dead. Stocks of body bags were exhausted, the officials said, and eighteen-wheel semi-trailers replaced ambulances.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The government&rsquo;s internal count of the dead, not previously revealed, far surpasses the toll of 3,117 announced on Jan. 21 by regime hardliners who report directly to Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. (Ministries report to the elected President.) The 30,000 figure is also far beyond tallies being compiled by activists methodically assigning names to the dead. As of Saturday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating 17,031 more.</p>



<p>TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures.</p>



<p>The Health Ministry&rsquo;s two-day figure roughly aligns with a count gathered by physicians and first responders, and also shared with TIME. That surreptitious tally of deaths recorded by hospitals stood at 30,304 as of Friday, according to Dr. Amir Parasta, a German-Iranian eye surgeon who prepared a report of the data. Parasta said that number does not reflect protest-related deaths of people registered at military hospitals, whose bodies were taken directly to morgues, or that happened in locales the inquiry did not reach. Iran&rsquo;s National Security Council has said protests took place in around 4,000 locations across the country.  </p>



<p>&ldquo;We are getting closer to reality,&rdquo; Dr. Parasta said. &ldquo;But I guess the real figures are still way higher.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That appears to be the reality implicit in the government&rsquo;s internal figure of more than 30,000 deaths in two days. A slaughter on that scale, in the space of 48 hours, had experts on mass killing groping for comparisons.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Most spasms of killing are not from shootings,&rdquo; said Les Roberts, a professor at Columbia University who specializes in the epidemiology of violent death. &ldquo;In Aleppo [Syria] and in Fallujah [Iraq], when spasms of death this high have occurred over a few days, it involved mostly explosives with some shooting.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The only parallel offered by online databases occurred in the Holocaust. On the outskirts of Kyiv on Sept. 29 and 30, 1941,<a href="https://time.com/6102593/ukraine-holocaust-memorial-kremlin-propaganda/" > Nazi death squads</a> executed 33,000 Ukrainian Jews by gunshot in a ravine known as<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kiev-and-babi-yar"  target="_blank"> Babyn Yar</a>.</p>



<p>In Iran, the killing fields extended across the country where, since Dec. 28, hundreds of thousands of citizens had assembled in the streets chanting first, for relief from an economy in freefall, and soon for the downfall of the Islamic regime. During the first week, security forces confronted some demonstrations, using mostly non-lethal force, but with officials also offering conciliatory language, the regime response was uncertain. That changed during the weekend commencing Jan. 8. Protests peaked, as opposition groups, <a href="https://x.com/PahlaviReza/status/2009041925647548815"  target="_blank">including</a> <a href="https://time.com/7346706/reza-pahlavi-iran-crown-prince-trump-protests/" >Reza Pahlavi,</a> the exiled son of Iran&rsquo;s former shah, urged people to join the throngs, and U.S. President Donald Trump repeated <a href="https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/" >vows to protect them</a>, though no help arrived.</p>



<p>Witnesses say millions were in the streets when authorities shut down the internet and all other communications with the outside world. Rooftop snipers and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns opened fire, according to eyewitnesses and cell phone footage. On Friday, Jan. 9, an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned on state television to anyone venturing into the streets, &ldquo;if &hellip; a bullet hits you, don&rsquo;t complain.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It took days for the reality to penetrate the internet blackout. Images of the bloodied bodies trickled out<a href="https://time.com/6249365/iran-elon-musk-starlink-protests/" > via illicit Starlink</a> satellite internet connections. The task of counting the dead was hampered, however, because the authorities had also cut off lines of communications inside Iran. The first firm information came from a Tehran doctor <a href="https://time.com/7345092/iran-protests-death-toll-regime-crackdown/" >who told </a>TIME that just six hospitals in the capital had recorded at least 217 protester deaths after Thursday&rsquo;s assault. Health care workers in Iran estimated at least 16,500 protesters had been killed by Jan. 10, according to an earlier report by Dr. Parasta in Munich. Friday&rsquo;s update built on that research, he said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am genuinely impressed by how quickly this work was pulled together under extremely constrained and risky conditions,&rdquo; said Paul B. Spiegel, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University International School of Health. Like Roberts, he expressed wariness of extrapolating from the figures provided by hospitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roberts, who traveled into war zones to research civilian death rates <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606694919/abstract"  target="_blank">in Iraq</a> and the Democratic Republic of <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/events/2000/10/continuing-crisis-in-the-drc-the-unheralded-death-toll-and-its-implications"  target="_blank">Congo</a>, said, &ldquo;the 30,000 verified deaths are almost certainly an underestimate.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The emergence of the Ministry of Health numbers appears to confirm that&mdash;while underscoring the stakes for both Iranians and a regime that, in 1979, came to power when a sitting government was confronted by millions of people demanding its downfall.</p>



<p>On Friday, Jan. 9, Sahba Rashtian, an aspiring animation artist, joined friends on the streets in Isfahan, a city in central Iran famous for its beauty. &#8220;Before anyone started chanting,&#8221; a friend told TIME, &#8220;Sahba was seen collapsed on the ground. Her sister noticed blood on her hand.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Sahba died on an operating table at a nearby hospital. She was 23.</p>



<p>&ldquo;She always joked about her beautiful name,&rdquo; her friend said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d laugh and say, &lsquo;Sahba means wine, and I am forbidden in the Islamic Republic.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>



<p>At the burial, the friend said, religious rites were barred, and Rashtian&rsquo;s father wore white.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; he told mourners, according to the friend. &ldquo;My daughter became a martyr on the path to freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mark-carney-davos-climate-change.jpg" alt="TOPSHOT-SWITZERLAND-POLITICS-ECONOMY-DIPLOMACY"/>



<p>For the first few days of the World Economic Forum in Davos, politicians, civil society leaders, and business executives waited in nervous anticipation of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s address to the conference&mdash;and any potential signal that he might try to make good on his promise to annex Greenland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s speech came and went, but it wasn&rsquo;t the most significant moment of the week-long confab. Instead, the biggest splash may have come the day before from the U.S.&rsquo;s northern ally turned rival Canada. In a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/davos-2026-special-address-by-mark-carney-prime-minister-of-canada/"  target="_blank">speech</a> bound for the history books, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney described a &ldquo;rupture&rdquo; in the world order and called for middle powers like Canada to stand up to bullies. He described the emergence of new coalitions of the willing to address issues aligned with their interests and values&mdash;rather than all nations following signals from the U.S. as they have been. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pursuing variable geometry, in other words,&rdquo; said Carney, &ldquo;different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>This reshaping will touch every aspect of the economy&mdash;and importantly it will have profound effects for energy and climate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most obvious impact is the divergent approach to energy technologies. In Davos, Trump Administration officials touted fossil fuels while panning renewables. &ldquo;Economically, it&rsquo;s been a failure,&rdquo; Energy Secretary Chris Wright said of global investment in renewable energy in a fireside chat. That stance will come as no surprise to anyone who has even loosely followed Trump&rsquo;s approach to energy, but in Davos the contrast to the rest of the world&rsquo;s thinking was striking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ursula Von Der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, said the European Union would double down on nuclear and renewables to free the bloc from &ldquo;manipulation&rdquo; by other countries&mdash;a group which might now reasonably be interpreted to include the U.S. &ldquo;Homegrown, reliable, resilient, and cheaper energy will drive our economic growth and secure our independence,&rdquo; she told a plenary session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said he would welcome more Chinese investment in key sectors&mdash;presumably including renewable energy where the country is a key player. The week before Davos, Carney traveled to China and agreed to all but eliminate Canada&rsquo;s steep tariffs on Chinese EVs, opening his country to China&rsquo;s cheap and popular automobiles to the detriment of U.S. automakers.</p>



<p>The U.S., however, has allies in its push to entrench fossil fuels. The CEO of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s state-owned oil company, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/davos-aramco-ceo-says-oil-glut-predictions-are-seriously-exaggerated-2026-01-22/"  target="_blank">touted</a> continued demand for oil as he made a case to leaders at Davos for the long-term future of his country&rsquo;s key export. (Though it is also investing in renewable energy.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Climate change wasn&rsquo;t exactly the main subject for top government officials this week, with pressing geopolitical concerns taking up most of the oxygen. But it&rsquo;s easy to see how Carney&rsquo;s coalition of the willing approach might unfold once leaders return from Davos and, one day, turn their attention to cutting global emissions. Indeed, before becoming Canada&rsquo;s prime minister, Carney had championed the idea of &ldquo;carbon clubs,&rdquo; where countries would join together to reduce emissions&mdash;with trade penalties for laggards outside the club. This year, the E.U.&rsquo;s border carbon adjustment mechanism&mdash;which taxes emissions from some products at the border&mdash;took effect. Other countries like Brazil are <a href="https://time.com/7288050/brazil-finance-minister-fernando-haddad-climate-change-interview/" >considering</a> related policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The response to Trump&rsquo;s energy posturing from the executives gathered in Davos was mixed. Behind the scenes, many insisted that their sustainability work would continue regardless of the Trump Administration&mdash;even as they avoid talking about it publicly. The long-term signal remains clear, they argue. But there&rsquo;s no question that at the very least this new global realignment increases the complexity of managing energy and climate work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the dust settles on this moment of chaotic and rapid change, the international climate regime will look dramatically different with new alliances and international relationships. The U.S. won&rsquo;t necessarily be alone, but it may find that standing apart comes at a cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Keir <a href="https://time.com/7349367/trump-greenland-tariff-threats-europe-fallout-starmer/" >Starmer has condemned President Donald Trump</a>&#8216;s false claims that non-American NATO troops &ldquo;stayed a little back&rdquo; from the front line during the war in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I consider President Trump&#8217;s remarks to be insulting and, frankly, appalling,&rdquo; said Starmer on Friday, adding he was not surprised the comments had caused &ldquo;such hurt&rdquo; across the country.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>Starmer paid tribute to the &ldquo;457 [members] of our armed services who lost their lives in Afghanistan&rdquo; and vowed to never forget the sacrifice they made to the United Kingdom. He also paid respect to the many more who were injured, &ldquo;some with life-changing&rdquo; injuries.</p>



<p>When told that some are calling for an apology from Trump, the U.K. Prime Minister appeared to be in agreement, although he stopped short of telling the President to apologize.</p>



<p> &ldquo;If I had misspoken in that way, or said those words, I would certainly apologize,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>As he did earlier in the week when denouncing Trump&#8217;s tariffs threat, Starmer doubled down on the importance of the &ldquo;very close relationship&rdquo; between the U.K. and U.S., but said it&#8217;s because of that alliance that the U.K. &ldquo;fought alongside the Americans for our values in Afghanistan.&rdquo;</p>



<p>According to British veterans charity <a href="https://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/about-us/news/afghanistan-war/"  target="_blank">Help for Heroes</a>, around 3,486 troops among the coalition forces died in the Afghanistan war. Over 2,300 of those were members of the U.S. armed forces.</p>



<p>TIME has reached out to the White House for comment.</p>



<p><strong>Read More</strong>: <em><a href="https://time.com/7349367/trump-greenland-tariff-threats-europe-fallout-starmer/" >Starmer Breaks With Trump Over &lsquo;Completely Wrong&rsquo; Greenland Tariff Threats and Urges Avoiding a Trade War</a></em></p>



<p>During an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6388087049112"  target="_blank">interview with Fox News</a> on Thursday, Trump said he was unsure if NATO would be there to support the U.S. if it were needed. </p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never needed them, we have never really asked anything of them. You know, they&rsquo;ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,&rdquo; he claimed.</p>



<p>Trump has repeatedly aired his grievances with NATO and <a href="https://time.com/7346819/can-trump-pull-united-states-out-of-nato-legal-experts/" >recently refused to ruled out leaving</a> the alliance over his contentious push to annex Greenland.</p>



<p>NATO&rsquo;s Article 5, in which all members consider &ldquo;an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all,&rdquo; has only been activated once, in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks in the U.S. in 2001.</p>



<p>Former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, after 9/11, pledged to &ldquo;stand shoulder to shoulder&rdquo; with the U.S. in its response to the al-Qaida attacks. British troops went on to play a role in the Afghanistan war <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/external/committees/committee-news-pre-oct-2020/2014/january/oral-ev--afghanistan/"  target="_blank">until their withdrawal in 2014.</a> The U.S. stayed on until August 2021.</p>



<p>Blair, who was recently appointed to serve on the Executive Board overseeing <a href="https://time.com/7357067/trump-gaza-board-of-peace-members-davos/" >Trump&rsquo;s Gaza Board of Peace</a>, responded to the President&rsquo;s remarks on Friday, although he didn&rsquo;t mention Trump by name.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the former Labour Party leader told TIME via email: &ldquo;Tony Blair knows&mdash;and will always remember with deep gratitude&mdash;the enormous contribution and sacrifice British troops made in Afghanistan on the front line of the fight against terrorism, following the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many British lawmakers issued stronger statements, directly denouncing Trump&rsquo;s false claims.</p>



<p>British Defence Secretary <a href="https://time.com/7344656/united-kingdom-helped-united-states-trump-seize-oil-tankers/" >John Healey</a> <a href="https://x.com/JohnHealey_MP/status/2014656307085607316"  target="_blank">said</a>: &ldquo;The U.K. and NATO allies answered the U.S. call. Those British troops should be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Alistair Carns, the U.K. Minister of State for the Armed Forces who himself served five tours in Afghanistan, <a href="https://x.com/AlistairCarns/status/2014626850383794194"  target="_blank">referred to</a> Trump&rsquo;s claims as &ldquo;utterly ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Many courageous and honorable service personnel from many nations fought on the front line,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shed blood, sweat, and tears together. And not everybody came home.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He later shared <a href="https://x.com/AlistairCarns/status/2014653403108946416"  target="_blank">a video </a>of himself serving on the front line in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>Leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, <a href="https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/2014633705722020315"  target="_blank">called</a> Trump&rsquo;s remarks &ldquo;flat-out nonsense&rdquo; and said the sacrifice of NATO troops deserves &ldquo;respect not denigration.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier on Friday, Downing Street had said that Trump was &ldquo;wrong to diminish the role of troops, including British forces.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Prince Harry, who returned to the U.K. this week to give evidence in his case against Associated Newspapers Limited, remembered how &ldquo;allies answered [the] call&rdquo; in support of the U.S.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost. Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defence of diplomacy and peace,&rdquo; he is quoted as saying.</p>



<p>Outside of the U.K., other NATO allies also took a firm stance against Trump&rsquo;s remarks.</p>



<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk <a href="https://x.com/donaldtusk/status/2014758253490475193"  target="_blank">recalled</a> a ceremony he attended in 2011 that paid tribute to five Polish soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The American officers who accompanied me then told me that America would never forget the Polish heroes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps they will remind President Trump of that fact.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2239796083.jpg" alt="Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney Meets With Trump At The White House"/>



<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney issued a stern response after President Donald Trump told Davos attendees that &ldquo;Canada lives because of the United States.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In a filmed <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/speeches/2026/01/22/building-canada-together-prime-minister-carney-delivers-remarks-citadelle"  target="_blank">address</a> delivered upon his return to Qu&eacute;bec City on Thursday, Carney&mdash;who also attended the World Economic Forum in Switzerland&mdash;firmly stated: &ldquo;Canada does not live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.&rdquo; </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Arguing that diversity is &ldquo;a strength, not a weakness,&rdquo; Carney maintained that Canada is &ldquo;the greatest country in the world to be a regular person&rdquo; and said you don&rsquo;t need to be rich, &ldquo;have a certain color,&rdquo; or &ldquo;worship a certain God&rdquo; in order to thrive.</p>



<p>Although he celebrated the long-standing partnership between the U.S. and Canada, Carney emphasized: &ldquo;We are masters in our home, this is our own country, it&rsquo;s our future, the choice is up to us.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump later rescinded his invitation for Canada to <a href="https://time.com/7357067/trump-gaza-board-of-peace-members-davos/" >join his Gaza Board of Peace</a>, which he unveiled in Davos on Thursday, after Carney had left the annual forum.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Please let this letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada&rsquo;s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,&rdquo; Trump said via Truth Social. (Carney <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE981Z_TaVo"  target="_blank">announced</a> earlier in the week that he had received an invitation to join the Board of Peace, but did not confirm if he intended to accept.)</p>



<p>Trump had previously lashed out at Canada during his Davos address on Wednesday, accusing the country of getting &ldquo;a lot of freebies&rdquo; from the U.S. and saying they should be &ldquo;grateful.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn&#8217;t so grateful,&rdquo; Trump told the audience, referencing the speech Carney had delivered the day before.</p>



<p>Although Carney didn&rsquo;t mention Trump by name, there appeared to be pointed references to the U.S. President throughout his own poignant address.</p>



<p>In a bold statement that prompted much discussion, Carney said the old world order is &ldquo;not coming back.&rdquo; Encouraging people not to &ldquo;mourn&rdquo; the way things used to be, he advised that &ldquo;nostalgia is not a strategy.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Carney also urged middle powers to stand up for themselves, accusing &ldquo;great powers&rdquo; of using economic pressure to yield results.</p>



<p>&ldquo;More recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>This came after Trump threatened to tariff European allies until Denmark agrees to sell Greenland to the U.S.&mdash;a threat he has since <a href="https://time.com/7355850/trump-greenland-deal-tariffs-davos/" >walked back</a> on.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2250224895.jpg" alt="FIFA World Cup 2026 Official Draw" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Carney <a href="https://time.com/7266178/canada-mark-carney-election-prime-minister/" >campaigned against</a> Trump&rsquo;s global tariff threats last year during his country&rsquo;s general election. His platform also strongly opposed Trump&rsquo;s annexation threats toward Canada.</p>



<p>Trump frequently&mdash;and publicly&mdash;<a href="https://time.com/7297490/trump-plan-to-annex-canada-51st-state-mark-carney/" >expressed his desire to annex Canada</a> and have it become the &ldquo;51st state&rdquo; upon returning to the White House. Both Carney and his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, stood firm that the annexation of Canada is not something they would allow to happen. During Trudeau&rsquo;s tenure, Trump took to referring to him as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H-1XWfMLhJU"  target="_blank">Governor Trudeau</a>&rdquo; rather than recognizing him as the Prime Minister of Canada.</p>



<p>Carney and Trump have worked on building a better working relationship, and have even shared jovial moments in front of the world press.</p>



<p>In October, when Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cge5dzp0vrlo"  target="_blank">mistakenly</a> referred to Carney as a &ldquo;President,&rdquo; Carney joked: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you upgraded me to President.&rdquo; To which Trump responded with: &ldquo;At least I didn&rsquo;t say Governor!&rdquo;</p>



<p>However, as Carney has since expressed Canada&rsquo;s full support to Greenland and Denmark maintaining their &ldquo;Arctic sovereignty,&rdquo; and amid tense disagreements over tariff threats, the relationship between the two leaders has become strained once more.</p>

<p>As people trickled into polling stations scattered across Myanmar to vote in the country&rsquo;s first elections since the 2021 military coup, much of the nation <a href="https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/airstrikes-and-attacks-continue-as-myanmar-junta-presses-ahead-with-election/"  target="_blank">remained consumed by war</a>.</p>



<p>On a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=746464231255335"  target="_blank">TV screen at polling stations</a>, a smiling woman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/02/inside-myanmar-sham-election"  target="_blank">sang and danced</a>: &ldquo;Hey dear friends, so that a colorful future may bloom, let us choose those who will shape tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The military junta has billed the vote, which was held in three stages concluding this Sunday, as a return to democracy. International observers, however, have widely dismissed the election as illegitimate, held amid ongoing conflict and mass displacement. The junta-backed party has already <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/29/myanmar-pro-military-party-claims-huge-lead-in-contentious-elections"  target="_blank">claimed</a> a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/29/myanmar-pro-military-party-claims-huge-lead-in-contentious-elections"  target="_blank">lead</a> in the first two rounds held in late December and early January.</p>



<p>Hundreds of people were killed in military crackdowns on protests and tens of thousands more arrested in the months after the coup five years ago that overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Thousands of people fled to the countryside, where they coalesced into anti-junta resistance groups or joined ethnic armed groups.</p>



<p>By May 2021, Myanmar was plunged into a civil war that has since killed 90,000 people, according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ACLEDINFO/posts/myanmars-junta-has-welcomed-the-end-of-us-temporary-protected-status-for-around-/1274387824708195/"  target="_blank">Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project</a>. According to the U.N., more than three million people have been displaced from their homes, with some fleeing mandatory conscription imposed by the junta in February 2024. The junta has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/amid-earthquake-crisis-myanmar-military-still-bombs-towns-2025-03-30/"  target="_blank">bombed towns</a>, <a href="https://fulcrum.sg/myanmars-internet-shutdowns-silencing-resistance-in-the-battle-for-connectivity/"  target="_blank">weaponized</a> internet shutdowns, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/myanmar-earthquake-junta-accused-blocking-aid"  target="_blank">restricted much-needed humanitarian aid</a> to civilians in areas controlled by resistance forces, even as it has lost control over large areas of the country to resistance groups.</p>



<p>Observers have warned that the elections could legitimize the junta&rsquo;s rule both at home and abroad, especially at a time when it is seeking to <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/elections/china-says-myanmar-junta-election-stems-from-xi-min-aung-hlaing-deal.html"  target="_blank">secure backing from China</a>. But for many Burmese people, already living in the throes of war, the outcome of the election is unlikely to change much.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are not interested in this election,&rdquo; says a man in his 50s from the Mandalay area, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons. He tells TIME he and many of the people around him still ended up voting out of fear, in his case that his sons will be conscripted, but few were excited to head to the polling station or learn about the candidates. &ldquo;We only know who we should not vote for,&rdquo; he says, even if the results seem pre-determined.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This so-called &lsquo;election&rsquo; is an attempt to prolong the junta&rsquo;s relentless violence and entrench impunity,&rdquo; Yadanar Maung, a spokesperson for Justice for Myanmar, a group of activists, tells TIME. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Low turnout</h2>



<p>Voter turnout during the first phase of the election was 52% and during the second phase 56%, according to the <a href="https://www.mtnewstoday.com/en/?p=11917"  target="_blank">junta</a>. That&rsquo;s a stark contrast from the roughly 70% of people who came out to vote in the country&rsquo;s 2015 and 2020 elections&mdash;the first democratic national elections in more than half a century of military rule. The excitement was <a href="https://time.com/4103972/burma-myanmar-election-day/" >palpable in those elections</a>, with many wearing red in support of Suu Kyi&rsquo;s party, the National League for Democracy, which swept the 2020 election.</p>



<p>Suu Kyi, now 80, has been in prison since February 2021, serving a 33-year sentence over allegations of election fraud, which she denies and which independent election observers have said lack evidence. The NLD and other major opposition parties have been <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/03/29/myanmar-junta-dissolves-political-parties"  target="_blank">disqualified</a> from running in the election. Even if a party besides the junta&rsquo;s proxy party, the Union Solidarity &amp; Development Party, gains a foothold in the election, the military is already guaranteed a quarter of the seats in both houses of parliament under the 2008 constitution. (Still, the junta has maintained that the election is free and fair. &ldquo;Even in developed democratic nations, there are situations where voter turnout does not exceed 50%,&rdquo; a junta spokesperson, Zaw Min Tun, told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-03/inside-myanmar-during-military-junta-sham-election-voting/106190364"  target="_blank">ABC</a>.)</p>



<p>&ldquo;If the parties are not credible or not broadly representative, it undermines the claim that the elections are the reflection of the popular will,&rdquo; says Maung Zarni, a Burmese academic and human rights activist exiled in the U.K.</p>



<p>The junta also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/myanmar-arrests-hundreds-under-new-election-law-ahead-december-vote-2025-12-19/"  target="_blank">enacted</a> a law against undermining elections last year, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/myanmar-arrests-hundreds-under-new-election-law-ahead-december-vote-2025-12-19/"  target="_blank">penalizes</a> criticisms of the election&mdash;including online discourse or calling for an election boycott&mdash;from three years in prison to the death penalty.</p>



<p>Large swathes of the country are <a href="https://x.com/minn_robert/status/2002392226593112299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2002392226593112299%7Ctwgr%5Ec0b3fb43a409453a55c0a0c7db1be57f601fbb5d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheonlinecitizen.com%2Fmyanmar%2Fjustice-for-myanmar-condemns-junta-s-sham-election-amid-widespread-voter-exclusion"  target="_blank">not holding elections</a> at all. The junta <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c390ndrny17o"  target="_blank">controlled</a> only around 21% of the country, as of December 2024, with ethnic armed groups and resistance forces controlling more than 40% of the country.</p>



<p>Much of the remaining contested areas are engulfed in intense fighting, making going out to vote an unrealistic task. Earlier this week, the junta <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/elections/clashes-force-myanmar-junta-to-cancel-voting-in-more-parts-of-kachin.html"  target="_blank">canceled</a> voting in two Kachin State townships and 11 villages due to clashes with forces aligned with the Kachin Independence Army.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The reality of staggering the elections in phases and cancelling polls in several townships (a larger number than in past elections) points to ongoing security concerns,&rdquo; says Moe Thuzar, a senior fellow at the Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute with a focus on Myanmar.</p>



<p>Even in areas where people can vote, many, especially the youth, are choosing not to. The man from Mandalay says while there was a queue of people at his polling station, young people were conspicuously absent.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I think this is for them to change their soldier uniforms into civilian ones and to hold onto their power,&rdquo; a 35-year-old from Rakhine state, which is largely controlled by the Arakan Army, told <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/unfair-election-young-voters-absent-from-myanmar-polls-cc2e208c"  target="_blank">AFP</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The junta has been decisively rejected by the people of Myanmar, with this sham election met by widespread boycotts and protests at great personal risk,&rdquo; Yadanar tells TIME.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">War rages on</h2>



<p>The election has been widely dismissed by international observers and governments as illegitimate. U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/10/myanmar-un-expert-urges-asean-not-step-backward-recognising-juntas-sham"  target="_blank">called</a> the election a &ldquo;sham.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Elections cannot be free, fair or credible when held amid military violence and repression, with political leaders detained and fundamental freedoms crushed,&rdquo; Andrews said. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which Myanmar is a member of, has also refused to certify the vote.</p>



<p>Some have described voting out of fear, with security personnel in traditional clothing and sunglasses and armed policemen skulking around polling areas, according to ABC. People who turned up at voting stations said they were afraid that if they didn&rsquo;t vote, they or their loved ones would be conscripted or that something bad might happen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/myanmar-police.jpg" alt="" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>&ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s legitimate or illegitimate, sham or real,&rdquo; says Zarni, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not going to change anything.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The years of transition to democratic rule from 2011 to 2020 saw foreign investment pour into the country and the government implement political reforms, shoring up job opportunities and roughly halving the poverty rate from 2005 to 2017. After the 2021 coup, much of that investment was withdrawn, inflation ballooned, and the country&rsquo;s currency, the kyat, collapsed.</p>



<p>The man from Mandalay tells TIME that life after the 2021 coup was marked by curfews under martial law, security checkpoints, and the sounds of explosions. Those aspects have become less frequent over the years in the city area, but people are still afraid.</p>



<p>And, he says, people know nothing will change after the election.</p>



<p>The elections aren&rsquo;t designed to address the country&rsquo;s economic conditions, the civil war that is continuing to displace and kill Burmese people across the country, or the fracturing of the country into territories controlled by groups, says Zarni.</p>



<p>International diplomatic pressure on the junta towards a cease-fire is possible, but analysts <a href="https://criticalasianstudies.org/commentary/2025/2/3/commentary-sike-chan-myanmars-2025-election-four-scenarios-shaping-a-fractured-nation"  target="_blank">suggest</a> that that is a less likely outcome of the election than a continuation of conflict and fragmented rule. Western governments have largely isolated the junta through sanctions already, and they are less likely to intervene given their own problems, Zarni says. Europe is focused on Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine and a renewed push by U.S. President Donald Trump to <a href="https://time.com/7355850/trump-greenland-deal-tariffs-davos/" >take control of Greenland</a>, while the U.S. is both retreating from the world stage and focused elsewhere.</p>



<p>&ldquo;People in Myanmar may be weary of the daily challenges to personal, socio-economic, and community security that they have had to confront as a consequence of the 2021 coup,&rdquo; says Thuzar.</p>



<p>Zarni tells TIME that the point of the election is to &ldquo;improve the optics&rdquo; of the regime in the eyes of the world. Last year, the country was <a href="https://time.com/7273653/myanmar-junta-earthquake-recovery-aid-civil-war-explainer/" >rocked by a powerful earthquake</a>, which forced the junta to make a rare appeal to the international community for help, even as ethnic armed groups claimed the junta carried out strikes in areas damaged by the earthquake and attacked aid convoys. Myanmar is also <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/bangladesh-myanmar"  target="_blank">on trial</a> at the International Court of Justice for genocide over its ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims; the International Criminal Court opened its own investigation into alleged crimes of humanity committed by the junta, including the persecution of the Rohingya.</p>



<p>Reducing Myanmar&rsquo;s isolation and increasing its economic engagement <a href="https://english.dvb.no/the-global-stakes-of-myanmars-2025-sham-junta-elections/"  target="_blank">would be in the junta&rsquo;s interests</a>. In that regard, it matters less what western governments or international agencies think, says Zarni. The junta is likely more interested in regional actors with which it already has a relationship, like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c051m0jn392o"  target="_blank">China</a> and <a href="https://www.cambodianess.com/article/russia-backs-myanmar-juntas-efforts-to-stabilise-country-fm"  target="_blank">Russia</a>, which have provided diplomatic cover, arms, and economic engagement since the coup, and <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/guest-column/why-myanmar-juntas-engagement-with-china-and-india-is-accelerating.html"  target="_blank">India</a> and <a href="https://www.thevietnamese.org/2023/12/bargaining-for-legitimacy-vietnams-involvement-in-the-myanmar-juntas-struggle-for-recognition/"  target="_blank">Vietnam</a>, which have maintained pragmatic or economic relations with the junta.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The junta&rsquo;s tyranny is sustained by allied authoritarian governments, multinational corporations, international banks and Myanmar cronies that fund, arm, equip and train the military, aiding and abetting its international crimes, enabled by global inaction,&rdquo; Yadanar, the Justice for Myanmar spokesperson, tells TIME.</p>



<p>The junta may also have in mind its involvement in ASEAN, which downgraded the country&rsquo;s participation, barring senior generals from high-level meetings. ASEAN membership offers the military a regional diplomatic foothold and a channel&mdash;however limited&mdash;for engagement that the junta appears keen to preserve.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The junta doesn&rsquo;t need the whole world to survive,&rdquo; Zarni says. &ldquo;It only needs a handful of technologically advanced and economically wealthy external actors to be its partner.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But mostly, Zarni says, the junta are holding the election for themselves. After seizing power in 2021, the military repeatedly justified the coup by alleging fraud in the 2020 election and promising a temporary return to military rule. Senior generals, including <a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2023/6269857/min-aung-hlaing/" >Min Aung Hlaing</a>, said at the time that new elections would be held and power handed to the winning party.</p>



<p>Even if its opponents see through the junta&rsquo;s election, with some ethnic armed organizations <a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/politics/knu-denounces-myanmar-juntas-election-as-unlawful-illegitimate.html"  target="_blank">denouncing</a> the election, the vote could provide reassurance to its own ranks, civil servants, and supporters and shore up morale and discipline within the armed forces.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The elections give them a chance to stand up in front of a television camera and tell a lie with a straight face,&rdquo; says Zarni. &ldquo;They need to tell their own rank-and-file that the military is not just there with their guns, they&rsquo;re in accord with the constitution of the country, therefore they are a lawful government.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Even the bad guys,&rdquo; Zarni says, &ldquo;have to tell themselves they&rsquo;re good guys.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/donald-trump-nato.jpg" alt="U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on board Air Force One while flying in between Ireland and Washington as he returns from the World Economic Forum on Jan. 22, 2026."/>



<p>Donald Trump suggested putting the world&rsquo;s strongest military alliance &ldquo;to the test&rdquo; in his latest social media posting that could have grave consequences.</p>



<p>The U.S. President has long criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which also includes 30 European allies and Canada, over his belief that other members don&rsquo;t pay their fair share.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;Maybe we should have put NATO to the test: Invoked Article 5, and forced NATO to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants, thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115941811687438015"  target="_blank">posted</a> on Truth Social Thursday night.</p>



<p>Article 5 refers to NATO&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nato.int/en/about-us/official-texts-and-resources/official-texts/1949/04/04/the-north-atlantic-treaty?selectedLocale="  target="_blank">mutual defense clause</a>, which states that an &ldquo;armed attack&rdquo; on one member is considered an attack on all 32 member-states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NATO <a href="https://www.nato.int/en/what-we-do/introduction-to-nato/collective-defence-and-article-5"  target="_blank">says</a> it assesses on a case-by-case basis what triggers Article 5&mdash;such as the &ldquo;invasion by one state of the territory of another state&rdquo;&mdash;but clarifies that &ldquo;events that lack an <em>international</em> element, such as purely domestic acts of terrorism, do not trigger&rdquo; the mutual defense clause, even though member states may choose to assist.</p>



<p>In the alliance&rsquo;s nearly-80-year history, the mutual defense clause has only been invoked once: <a href="https://www.nato.int/en/news-and-events/events/media-advisories/2001/09/12/statement-by-the-north-atlantic-council"  target="_blank">on the day after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks</a>, and the U.S.&rsquo;s NATO allies then backed the American response in Afghanistan, where more than 1,000 non-American NATO soldiers were ultimately killed.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s latest Truth Social post comes amid his ongoing threat to pull the <a href="https://time.com/7346819/can-trump-pull-united-states-out-of-nato-legal-experts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" >U.S. out of the alliance</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never needed them&mdash;we have never really asked anything of them,&rdquo; the President <a href="https://youtu.be/pLbo02VA0iE?t=315"  target="_blank">told Fox Business</a> on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Thursday. &ldquo;You know, they&rsquo;ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan or this or that, and they did: they stayed a little back, little off the front lines.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The day before, Trump, in his <a href="https://time.com/7355488/trump-davos-speech-takeaways-analysis/" >meandering speech in Davos</a>, blasted NATO&rsquo;s seeming unreliability: &ldquo;I know them all very well. I&rsquo;m not sure that they&rsquo;d be there. I know we&rsquo;d be there for them. I don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;d be there for us.&rdquo;</p>



<div class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw">[video id=oL9X8h53 autostart="viewable" vertical video_text=Trump speaks as tensions over Greenland dominate Davos]</div>



<p>Trump particularly <a href="https://time.com/7354005/trump-davos-speech-greenland/" >criticized</a> NATO ally Denmark, as he <a href="https://time.com/7344877/trump-greenland-annexation-threats-purchase-national-security-economic/" >campaigns to bring Greenland</a>, a semi-autonomous territory <a href="https://time.com/7347183/denmark-greenland-trump-europe/" >of the Kingdom of Denmark</a>, under U.S. control. He called the Nordic country &ldquo;ungrateful&rdquo; after falsely claiming that the U.S. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/23/did-the-us-give-greenland-back-to-denmark-trump-omits-history-at-davos"  target="_blank">gave</a>&rdquo; Greenland back to Denmark after American forces defended it during World War II.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Mark Rutte, NATO&rsquo;s secretary general, pushed back <a href="https://youtu.be/7Ut0aTWufcA?t=144"  target="_blank">Wednesday</a> to assert that NATO did help the U.S. in Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;For every two Americans who paid the ultimate price,&rdquo; Rutte said, &ldquo;there was one soldier from another NATO country who did not come back to his family&mdash;from the Netherlands, from Denmark, particularly from other countries.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Denmark actually suffered the highest per capita deaths among the military coalition members in the Afghanistan conflict: military casualty tracker <a href="http://icasualties.org"  target="_blank">iCasualties.org</a> lists 43 Danish soldiers killed.</p>



<p>&ldquo;You are not absolutely sure that the Europeans would come to the rescue of the U.S. if you will be attacked,&rdquo; Rutte told Trump. &ldquo;Let me tell you, they will.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256967562.jpg" alt="Day Three Of World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026"/>



<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized European leaders, accusing them of failing to act when it comes to defending Ukraine against Russia.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Europe loves to discuss the future, but avoids taking action today, action that defines what kind of future we will have,&rdquo; Zelensky said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Referencing <em>Groundhog Day</em>&mdash;a film which shows the same day being repeated again and again&mdash;Zelensky highlighted the lack of progress that has been made since he took to the Davos stage last year.</p>



<p>Describing Europe as &ldquo;lost,&rdquo; he said the continent &ldquo;remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers&rdquo; when it should instead be &ldquo;taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Although he thanked some European leaders for their support&mdash;calling out U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron for offering post-cease-fire <a href="https://time.com/7314566/zelensky-trump-ukraine-america-security-guarantees-russia-conflict/" >security guarantees</a>&mdash;Zelensky hit out at the continent for not presenting a strong, united front.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian leader compared Europe&rsquo;s approach to that of President Donald Trump, who he shared a closed-door meeting with prior to taking to the stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;President Trump is needed,&rdquo; said Zelensky, arguing that a cease-fire with Russia will rely on the support of the U.S. &ldquo;No security guarantees work without the U.S.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Zelensky pointed to the recent seizures of Russian oil tankers (<a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2014341199507706242"  target="_blank">Macron confirmed</a> the seizure of a vessel during Zelensky&rsquo;s speech) and encouraged further action be taken to apprehend Russian-flagged vessels in international waters.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Russian oil is being transported right along European shores. That oil funds the war against Ukraine, that oil helps destabilize Europe,&rdquo; he said, suggesting that all Russian oil be confiscated and &ldquo;sold for Europe&rsquo;s benefit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Urging Europe to step up and lead, he continued: &ldquo;We should not degrade ourselves to secondary roles, not when we have a chance to be a great power together&hellip; When united, we are truly invincible, and Europe can and must be a global force, not one that reacts late, but one that defines the future.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Zelensky then encouraged Europe to look inward rather than trying to change Trump, who &ldquo;will not change.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;He [Trump] says he loves Europe, but he will not listen to this kind of Europe,&rdquo; said Zelensky, seemingly in reference to the most <a href="https://time.com/7355850/trump-greenland-deal-tariffs-davos/" >recent transatlantic spat</a> over Greenland.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Everyone turned attention to Greenland, and it&rsquo;s clear most leaders simply are not sure what to do about it. And it seems like everyone is just waiting for America to cool down on this topic, hoping it will pass away. But what if it will not, what then?&rdquo; Zelensky queried.</p>



<p>The Ukrainian leader also made sure to mention the U.S.<a href="https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/" > capture</a> of fallen Venezuelan President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro and his wife, <a href="https://time.com/7343188/who-is-cilia-flores-maduro-wife-venezuela-politics/" >Cilia Flores</a>. He compared the former leadership of Venezuela to the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>&ldquo;President Trump led an operation in Venezuela, and Maduro was arrested. There were different opinions about it, but the fact remains that Maduro is on trial in New York. Putin is not on trial,&rdquo; said Zelensky, arguing that more needs to be done to enforce the Russian President&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/6264280/vladimir-putin-icc-warrant-arrest/" >arrest warrant</a> issued by the International Criminal Court in <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/situations/ukraine"  target="_blank">March 2023</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;As for Iran, everyone is waiting to see what America will do, and the world offers nothing,&rdquo; said Zelensky, pointing to the threat Trump issued during Iran&rsquo;s deadly protests. &ldquo;Europe offers nothing and does not want to enter this issue at the support of the Iranian people and the democracy they need.&rdquo; (Despite his earlier threats, Trump did not launch a military intervention in Iran, which left <a href="https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/" >some Iranian protesters feeling abandoned</a>.)</p>



<p>Zelensky concluded his remarks by reaffirming Ukraine&rsquo;s readiness to end the war that<a href="https://time.com/6150708/russia-ukraine-invasion-war/" > Russia started by its invasion in 2022</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Russia must become ready to finish this war, to stop this aggression,&rdquo; he said, urging Europe and the U.S. to place more pressure on Moscow and offer additional support to Kyiv.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256946619.jpg" alt="SWITZERLAND-US-POLITICS-ECONOMY-DIPLOMACY"/>



<p>President Donald Trump has officially launched his <a href="https://time.com/7346341/gaza-phase-two-ceasefire-committee-members-peace-board/" >Gaza Board of Peace</a>, amid concerns from European nations over its membership and the potential involvement of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>Returning to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday morning, Trump was joined by the board&rsquo;s newly-announced members, many of whom hail from the Middle East and South America. The U.S. President said he was honored to be the chairman of what could be &ldquo;one of the most consequential bodies ever created.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>There was a notable lack of leaders from Western European nations with Trump on stage. The U.K. had earlier expressed reservations about the possibility of Putin being involved. Despite receiving an invitation, Putin is thought to be still considering.</p>



<p>Trump sparked concerns earlier in the week when he suggested his board &ldquo;might&rdquo; replace the United Nations, but he somewhat backtracked on that, instead presenting the board as having &ldquo;tremendous potential with the United Nations.&rdquo; Sharing his hopes for the new organization, he said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work with many others, including the U.N.&rdquo; The United Nations adopted the U.S.-penned resolution establishing the Board of Peace in November.</p>



<p>Other concerns related to the board center on the charter draft which reportedly states that while nations who accept the invitation will be given a three-year membership term, permanent membership will be given to member states that contribute $1 billion in cash within the first year.</p>



<p>Putin said on Thursday that Moscow is open to contributing $1 billion to the Board of Peace, but argued it would require the release of Russian assets in the U.S. that were frozen during the Biden Administration.</p>



<p>Sidestepping the mounting reservations at Davos, Trump instead celebrated a new dawn for Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war is &ldquo;really coming to an end,&rdquo; he said, before delivering a stark warning to Hamas, who must disarm. Referring to Hamas as being made up of people &ldquo;born with rifles in their hands,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;They have to give up their weapons, and if they don&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s going to be the end of them.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The President also called for Hamas to release the final deceased Israeli hostage, <a href="https://x.com/bringhomenow/status/2014217502637658300"  target="_blank">Ran Gvili</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking about Gaza, Trump referred to himself as a &ldquo;real estate person at heart&rdquo; and referenced the placement of the territory. &ldquo;I said look at this location on the sea. People that are living so poorly are going to be so well, but it all began with the location.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Board of Peace unveiling comes a week after Trump&rsquo;s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced the launch of &ldquo;Phase Two&rdquo; of the <a href="https://time.com/7327675/trump-israel-gaza-deal-interview/" >Gaza cease-fire plan</a>, officially embarking on the &ldquo;demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction&rdquo; of the territory.</p>



<p>Phase One encountered setbacks due to Hamas not handing over the final deceased hostage and the Israeli airstrikes that occurred after the cease-fire came into effect in October.</p>



<p>Moving forward, the Board of Peace will provide oversight to the <a href="https://time.com/7346341/gaza-phase-two-ceasefire-committee-members-peace-board/" >National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG),</a> who will oversee the day-to-day rebuilding efforts. As announced last week, the committee will be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority.</p>



<p>Ahead of the official signing and ratification of the Board of Peace, Trump went through a long list of, what he views to be, his accomplishments overseas.</p>



<p>Praising the &ldquo;unrivalled skill set of the U.S. Military,&rdquo; he looked back on last year&rsquo;s strikes against three key nuclear sites in Iran. &ldquo;Iran does want to talk, and we&#8217;ll talk,&rdquo; he added, in an apparent reference to the U.S. <a href="https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/" >retreating after initially threatening</a> to take action over the deadly Iran protests. Trump also lauded his recent <a href="https://time.com/7342994/trump-maduro-regime-change-maga/" >Venezuela operation</a>, which resulted in the capture and detainment of fallen President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.</p>



<p>Turning his attention back to the members of his board, Trump referred to the signatories as &ldquo;great people, great leaders&rdquo; and said the organization is already &ldquo;running beautifully.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s been noted that other members may sign at a later date, you can see the full list of today&rsquo;s Board of Peace signatories, below. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The &ldquo;New Gaza&rdquo;</strong></h2>



<p>Jared Kushner, Trump&#8217;s son-in-law and senior adviser, outlined the board&#8217;s vision for Gaza&rsquo;s reconstruction, displaying mock-ups of high-rises along the enclave&rsquo;s seafront. He proposed the introduction of different zones to promote &ldquo;coastal tourism&rdquo; and economic prosperity.</p>



<p>&ldquo;New Gaza, it could be a hope. It could be a destination, have a lot of industry, and really be a place that the people there can thrive,&rdquo; said Kushner, estimating that some construction could be completed within the next two to three years.</p>



<p>Expressing total confidence in the proposal, he said &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;Plan B,&rsquo;&rdquo; just a &ldquo;master plan.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The proposal was bolstered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who described the board as a &ldquo;new era and a new stage.&rdquo; He went on to suggest the board could make an impact beyond Gaza, stating that &ldquo;it will serve as an example of what&#8217;s possible in other parts of the world.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Kushner and Rubio will both serve on an &ldquo;Executive Board&rdquo; intended to &ldquo;operationalize the Board of Peace&rsquo;s vision.&rdquo;</p>



<p>They will be joined by Witkoff, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, president of the World Bank Group Ajay Banga, national security adviser Robert Gabriel, and Marc Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management, one of the biggest U.S. private equity firms.</p>



<p>According to the White House, each Executive Board member will &ldquo;oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza&rsquo;s stabilization and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaders from across the tech sector, academia, and beyond gathered to explore how to implement responsible AI and ensure safeguarding while fostering innovation, at a roundtable convened by TIME in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21. </p>



<p>In a wide-ranging conversation, participants in the roundtable, hosted by TIME CEO Jess Sibley, discussed topics including the impact of AI on children&rsquo;s development and safety, how to regulate the technology, and how to better train models to ensure they don&rsquo;t harm humans.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Discussing the safety of children, Jonathan Haidt, professor of ethical leadership at NYU Stern and author of <em>The Anxious Generation, </em>said that parents shouldn&rsquo;t focus on restricting their child&rsquo;s exposure entirely but on the habits they form. He suggested that children don&rsquo;t need smartphones until &ldquo;at least high school&rdquo; and that they don&rsquo;t need to be exposed to the technology to be able to learn how to use it at the age of 15. &ldquo;Let their brain develop, let them get executive function, then you can expose them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshua Bengio, professor at the Universit&eacute; de Montreal and founder of LawZero, said that scientific understanding of the problems posed by AI is necessary to solve them. He outlined two mitigations: first, designing AI that has built-in safeguarding to avoid harming a child&rsquo;s development. This could be brought about by demand, noted Bengio, who is known as one of the &ldquo;godfathers of AI.&rdquo; Second, he said, governments should play a role; they could potentially implement mechanisms such as using liability insurers to indirectly regulate AI developers by making insurance mandatory for developers and deployers of AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the U.S. AI race with China is often cited as a reason to support limiting regulation and guardrails on American AI companies, Bengio argued: &ldquo;Actually, the Chinese also don&rsquo;t want their children to be in trouble. They don&rsquo;t want to create a global monster AI, they don&rsquo;t want people to use their AI to create more bio-weapons or cyberattacks on their soil. So both the U.S. and China have an interest in coordinating on these things once they can see past the competition.&rdquo; Bengio said international cooperation like this has happened before, such as when the U.S. and the USSR coordinated on nuclear weapons during the Cold War.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The roundtable participants also discussed the similarities between AI and social media companies, noting that AI is increasingly in competition for users&rsquo; attention. &ldquo;All the progress in history has been about appealing to the better angels of our nature,&rdquo; said Bill Ready, CEO of Pinterest, which sponsored the event. &ldquo;Now we have, one of the largest business models in the world has at its center engagement, pitting people against one another, sowing division.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready added: &ldquo;We&#8217;re actually preying on the darkest aspects of the human psyche, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. So we&rsquo;re trying to prove it&rsquo;s possible to do something different.&rdquo; He said that, under his leadership, Pinterest has stopped optimizing to maximize view time and started optimizing to maximize outcomes, including those off the platform. &ldquo;In the short term, that was negative, but if you look long term, people would come back more frequently,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>Bengio emphasized the importance of finding a way to design AI that will &ldquo;provide safety guarantees as the systems become bigger and we have more data.&rdquo; Setting sufficient conditions for training AI systems to ensure they operate with honesty could also be a solution, Bengio posited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yejin Choi, professor of computer science and senior fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) at Stanford University, added that AI models today are trained &ldquo;to misbehave, and by design, it&rsquo;s going to be misaligned.&rdquo; She asked: &ldquo;What if there could be an alternative form of intelligence that really learns &hellip; morals, human values from the get-go, as opposed to just training LLMs [large language models] on the entirety of the internet, which actually includes the worst part of humanity, and then we then try to patch things up by doing &lsquo;alignment&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responding to the question of whether AI can make us better humans, Kay Firth-Butterfield, CEO of the Good Tech Advisory, pointed to ways we can make AI a better tool for humans, including by talking to the people who are actually using it, whether that&rsquo;s workers or parents. &ldquo;What we need to do is to really think about: how do we create an AI literacy campaign amongst everybody and not have to fall back on organizations?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We need that conversation, and then we can make sure AI gets certified.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Other attendees at the TIME100 Roundtable included Matt Madrigal, CTO at Pinterest; Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare; Jeff Schumacher, Neurosymbolic AI Leader at EY-Parthenon; Navrina Singh, CEO of Credo AI, and Alexa Vignone, president of technology, media, telco and consumer &amp; business services at Salesforce, &#8203;&#8203;where TIME co-chair and owner Marc Benioff is CEO.</p>



<p><em>TIME100 Roundtable: Ensuring AI For Good &mdash; Responsible Innovation at Scale was presented by Pinterest.</em></p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257448070.jpg" alt="U.S. President Trump Attends World Economic Forum In Davos"/>



<p>President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he had reached what he called a &ldquo;framework of a future deal&rdquo; with NATO over Greenland, easing a <a href="https://time.com/7354005/trump-davos-speech-greenland/" >standoff</a> with European allies and backing away from plans to impose new tariffs that had rattled global markets for days.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The announcement, delivered first in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115934734335579278"  target="_blank">post on his Truth Social</a> platform and later amplified in brief remarks to reporters, followed a meeting with <a href="https://time.com/7295448/rutte-nato-secretary-general-interview/" >Mark Rutte</a>, the NATO secretary general, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Trump said the understanding would avert tariffs that had been scheduled to take effect on Feb. 1 on goods from eight European countries that had resisted his demands over Greenland.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,&rdquo; Trump wrote, adding that &ldquo;based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The American President offered few details about what the framework entails. When asked whether the agreement involved the U.S. gaining ownership of Greenland, an outcome he has repeatedly framed as essential to national security, Trump paused before replying, &ldquo;Uhh&hellip; it&rsquo;s a long-term deal.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He described the arrangement as a &ldquo;work in progress,&rdquo; saying the &ldquo;deal is going to be put out soon&rdquo; and that it &ldquo;gets us everything we wanted, including real national security.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Denmark, which governs the semi-autonomous island, had earlier ruled out negotiations over ceding Greenland to the United States. Trump did not claim that Denmark had reversed that position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the lack of specifics, financial markets reacted swiftly. U.S. stocks jumped after the announcement, extending gains that followed days of volatility triggered by Trump&rsquo;s tariff threats.</p>



<p>The Greenland dispute has loomed large over Davos this week, dominating conversations among diplomats and executives after Trump threatened countries including Denmark and the United Kingdom with a 10% tariff in February&mdash;and rising to 25% by June&mdash;unless they acceded to U.S. control of the island. The threats prompted European leaders to prepare countermeasures and pushed markets lower earlier in the week.</p>



<p>In a speech earlier on Wednesday in Davos, Trump made <a href="https://time.com/7354005/trump-davos-speech-greenland/" >his most explicit case yet</a> for the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, while noting he would <a href="https://time.com/7354286/trump-greenland-force-davos/" >not use military force</a> to seize it. Instead, he called for &ldquo;immediate negotiations&rdquo; with Denmark, even as Danish officials reiterated that they would not &ldquo;enter into any negotiations.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Administration officials had signaled throughout the day that a climbdown was possible. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged allies to &ldquo;sit back&rdquo; and &ldquo;take a deep breath,&rdquo; while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told a Davos panel that the confrontation was &ldquo;going to end in a reasonable manner.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s post suggested that Rutte, the NATO Secretary General who once <a href="https://time.com/7297927/trump-daddy-nickname-nato-mark-rutte-john-daly-tucker-carlson/" >called him &ldquo;daddy,&rdquo;</a> played a central role in defusing the crisis. Rutte did not elaborate on the deal, but told reporters they had a &ldquo;very good meeting&rdquo; and confirmed they reached an agreement.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/7295448/rutte-nato-secretary-general-interview/" >Mark Rutte&mdash;The Man Who Wants to Save NATO</a></em></p>



<p>&ldquo;His Truth Social post is exactly to the point, and I totally agree with that,&rdquo; Rutte said.</p>



<p>Trump said that Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and other officials would lead further discussions on Greenland and related Arctic issues, including the &ldquo;Golden Dome&rdquo; missile defense system that Trump has argued would benefit from U.S. control of the island.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations,&rdquo; Trump wrote.</p>

<p>In his much anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in <a href="https://time.com/7354005/trump-davos-speech-greenland/" >Davos on Wednesday</a>, President Donald Trump reiterated his desire to take over Greenland, railed against wind farms, and criticized what he claimed was an imbalance in trade between the United States and the rest of the world.  </p>



<p>He also delved into a range of domestic political issues, airing grievances against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, and former President Joe Biden. </p>

<p>Here are some of the key claims that Trump made in his <a href="https://time.com/7355488/trump-davos-speech-takeaways-analysis/" >speech</a>.   </p>



<p>Read more: <a href="https://time.com/7353366/newsom-trump-advice-to-world-leaders/" >Newsom Tells World Leaders to Stand Up to Trump: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Just Pathetic&rsquo; </a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The U.S. gave Greenland back </h2>



<p><strong>What Trump said</strong>: &ldquo;After the war, which we won, without us, you&#8217;d all be speaking German and a little Japanese. After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? How ungrateful are they now?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;So we want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won&#8217;t give it.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>The facts</strong>: The U.S. never owned Greenland. In 1941, during the Second World War, the U.S. and Denmark signed an <a href="https://govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-55/pdf/STATUTE-55-Pg1245.pdf"  target="_blank">agreement</a> granting the U.S. the right to establish military bases on the island to defend it from Nazi Germany, while recognizing the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark over the territory. The island is, however, covered with a large <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/climate-science/sea-ice/researchers-find-3-million-year-old-landscape-beneath-greenland-ice-sheet/"  target="_blank">amount of ice</a>. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The U.S. pays for NATO </h2>



<p><strong>What Trump said</strong>: &ldquo;We pay for NATO. We paid for many years, until I came along, in my opinion, 100% of NATO, because they weren&#8217;t paying their bills. &rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>The facts</strong>: This is an inaccurate claim that Trump has been repeating since his first presidency. NATO figures show that in 2025, the United States paid for roughly 16% of its budget. In the same year, 31 of the 32 NATO members are estimated to have contributed 2% of their GDP to NATO.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">China has no wind farms</h2>



<p><strong>What Trump said</strong>: &ldquo;China makes almost all of the wind mills, and yet I haven&rsquo;t been able to find any wind farms in China&hellip; They make them. They sell them for a fortune&hellip;But they don&rsquo;t use them themselves.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>The facts:</strong> China&rsquo;s installations of windmills in 2024 made up 70% of the global total, and the cumulative electricity capacity was more than 520 GW, accounting for almost 50% of the total global wind power installed capacity, according to <a href="https://26973329.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/26973329/2.%20Reports/Global%20Wind%20Report/GWEC%20Global%20Wind%20Report%202025.pdf"  target="_blank">a report</a> from the Global Wind Energy Council.   </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Europe&#8217;s energy prices are higher</h2>



<p><strong>What Trump said</strong>: &ldquo;Germany now generates 22% less electricity than it did in 2017&hellip; and the electricity prices are &ldquo;64% higher.&rdquo; </p>



<p>&ldquo;The United Kingdom produces just 1/3 of the total energy from all sources that it did in 1999.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>The facts</strong>: Germany generated a total of 406.9 TWh of electricity in 2025, a 25% decrease from 2017, when it generated 546.9 TWh, according to <a href="https://www.energy-charts.info/downloads/electricity_generation_germany_2025.pdf"  target="_blank">reports</a> <a href="https://www.energy-charts.info/downloads/Stromerzeugung_2017_e.pdf"  target="_blank">from</a> the Fraunhofer Institute. Electricity prices, however, have increased by 35%, according to the <a href="https://www.bundeswirtschaftsministerium.de/Redaktion/EN/Infografiken/Energie/energiedaten-energietraeger-34.html"  target="_blank">statistics</a> <a href="https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/5884/217166/prices-for-household-customers"  target="_blank">from </a>Germany&#8217;s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. As for the United Kingdom, the country generated a total of 285 TWh of electricity in 2024, 25% less than it produced in 2000, according to <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/688890c3a11f859994409132/UK_Energy_in_Brief_2025.pdf"  target="_blank">data</a> from the UK government. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 2020 election was stolen</h2>



<p><strong>What Trump said:</strong> &ldquo;It&#8217;s a war that should have never started and it wouldn&#8217;t have started if the 2020 US presidential election weren&#8217;t rigged. It was a rigged election. Everybody now knows that. They found out. People will soon be prosecuted for what they did. &rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>The facts</strong>: There is no evidence that the 2020 election was rigged. Following the election, Republicans at the <a href="https://time.com/5921583/william-barr-leaving-justice-department/" >federal</a> and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2023/08/politics/trump-georgia-2020-election/"  target="_blank">state</a> levels launched multiple investigations into the results of the 2020 election and found <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f"  target="_blank">no rampant voter fraud</a>. Trump&rsquo;s former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, baselessly claimed that Dominion Voting Systems manipulated its results in favor of former President Joe Biden. Dominion sued Giuliani for defamation, and Giuliani reached a confidential settlement in 2025. He was also disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C. for repeating false statements regarding the 2020 elections. <br></p>

<p>Europe was anxious after World War I. To fortify their defenses against Germany, the French built the Maginot Line&mdash;a vast system of fortifications, obstacles, and weapon installations along France&rsquo;s borders with Germany&mdash;in the 1930s. In 1940, Germany circumvented the Maginot Line by invading through Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to the north, ultimately defeating France within six weeks.</p>


[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]


<p>The French elite&rsquo;s almost mystical belief in the invulnerability of the Maginot Line was one of the reasons for the country&rsquo;s strange defeat in 1940, argued the historian William L. Shirer in his acclaimed book, <em>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</em>. &ldquo;The French placed all their faith in the line of fortification that, in the end, became more of a psychological crutch than a strategic asset,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>



<p>Today, we are witnessing the unraveling of the post&ndash;Cold War European order and the real risk of a rupture in the transatlantic alliance as a result of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s attacks on Europe and his determination to buy or annex Greenland. This state of affairs compels one to ask whether future historians will argue that European confidence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was Europe&rsquo;s Maginot Line of the mind&mdash;a psychological crutch that created a false sense of security and prevented Europe from preparing to meet its existential challenges.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How NATO shaped Europe</h3>



<p>Could it be that Europe&rsquo;s current sense of vulnerability is above all a failure of the European imagination? Most European policymakers agree in private that Americans can no longer be trusted to defend their allies. Yet publicly they insist that NATO remains vital for the defense of Europe. European publics are less diplomatic. A recent study conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations reveals that<a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/transatlantic-twilight-european-public-opinion-and-the-long-shadow-of-trump/"  target="_blank"> only 16%</a> of Europeans view the United States as an ally. Perhaps, more striking, a fifth of the respondents described it as an adversary or a rival.</p>



<p>In the aftermath of the Cold War, NATO was Europe&rsquo;s last religion. It was more than simply a defense alliance; it was the Holy Spirit that ruled the world at the end of history. Europeans were mesmerized by American military power, and they found little reason to doubt Washington&rsquo;s commitment to the security of the Old Continent. The existence of NATO made it possible for the majority of Europeans to fantasize that a major war in Europe was unthinkable in the 21st century. European fealty to NATO prevented them from recognizing that in the post-Cold War environment, particularly in Eastern Europe, demilitarizing Europe rather than building its defense capabilities had become the alliance&rsquo;s central task.</p>



<p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, the expansion of NATO to Central Europe in 1999 came not as a response to some eternal<strong> </strong>Russian threat, but out of fear of the return of nationalism and wars inspired by nationalism. NATO was expanded to Eastern Europe in the wake of the Yugoslav wars, and it saw itself as protecting Europe from the demons of its past. &ldquo;European peace today is not merely the absence of war but the marginalization of war-making from national life&mdash;a profound cultural and institutional shift,&rdquo; James J. Sheehan, wrote in his 2008 history of post-War Europe, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/books/review/Wheatcroft-t.html"  target="_blank"><em>Where Have All the Soldiers Gone</em></a>.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The treatment of national minorities, rather than defense capabilities, became a key reason for joining the Atlantic alliance. For decades, European forces weren&rsquo;t trained for autonomous defense but to fight together with the Americans and invariably under American command. The paradoxical role of NATO as an instrument of disarmament rather than of building capable militaries finds its clearest illustration in an unlikely pair: Sweden and Finland, which resisted membership for decades, joined NATO only after Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine and now stand as the alliance&rsquo;s most combat-ready members.</p>



<p>Around 15 years ago, Robert Gates, the Secretary of Defense in the Obama Administration articulated American impatience with European complacency over international security and gaps in defense funding for NATO. &ldquo;If the current trends in the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/10/nato-dismal-future-pentagon-chief"  target="_blank"> decline of European defense</a> capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders&mdash;those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me&mdash;may not consider the return on America&rsquo;s investment in NATO worth the cost,&rdquo; Gates warned.</p>



<p>Europeans were not ready to believe him.</p>



<p>And then Donald Trump emerged on the political stage. After accepting the Republican nomination for president in July 2016, he<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/us/politics/donald-trump-issues.html"  target="_blank"> spoke about</a> conditioning American defense of NATO allies under attack to their contributions to the alliance. After his election, Trump privately<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/us/politics/trump-rallies-west-virginia-midterms.html"  target="_blank"> threatened to withdraw</a> from the alliance during a summit in Brussels. Europeans read it as bluster and waited for him to leave office. In Jan. 2025, Trump returned to the White House. And it was too late for Europeans to confect alternatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Trump and the future of NATO</h3>



<p>What is the future of NATO in a Trumpian world in which Europe has lost its centrality for the United States? And what of the emerging calculus, whispered but increasingly believed, that being an American ally is becoming more dangerous than being America&rsquo;s enemy?</p>



<p>Trump did not simply change Europe&rsquo;s position on the American map of the world, he brought a new map by which Washington sees the world. He doesn&rsquo;t consider America&rsquo;s alliance system an asset; he perceives it as a liability. While some envy Washington for its alliances, Trump envies China for being unconstrained by allies.</p>



<p>His aversion to alliances explains, at least partially, the fact that he sees the war in Ukraine as analogous to 1914, when the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo by a Serbian nationalist led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia and set off a chain reaction that sparked World War I. When Trump looks at the crisis in Europe, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to think of British folly in believing that it had bought peace after signing a peace treaty with Adolf Hitler in Munich in 1938. Trump understands the risk of the U.S. sleepwalking into a disastrous and unnecessary war with Putin&rsquo;s Russia as far higher than the risk of appeasing a revisionist power that tries to reconquer parts of Europe. For Trump, Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine is Sarajevo rather than Munich.</p>



<p>The question of NATO&rsquo;s future should be understood as a response to two separate questions.For the Trump Administration, the question is what role NATO has when America no longer views the European Union as an American project but still wants to retain the Old Continent within its sphere of influence. It is a vision where America seeks to replace the Cold War West, which was described as the &ldquo;free world&rdquo; and defined by shared liberal values, with a cultural West rooted in Christianity and whiteness.</p>



<p>For Europeans, the stakes are different but no less urgent. They see NATO as essential to&nbsp; weathering Trump&rsquo;s assault, and to building their own defense capabilities in an increasingly anarchic world, in which American security guarantees can no longer be taken for granted. Trump can be tempted to believe that if there is no NATO there is no reason for the Russian President Vladimir Putin not to become Washington&rsquo;s best friend. Europeans can be tempted to believe that increasing defense budgets will be enough to defend Europe in the absence of the United States.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The theater of American Empire</h3>



<p>The audacious special operation by the U.S. in Venezuela was a pageant of imperial might. It was a preview of what we may call theatrical imperialism&ndash;&ndash;an emerging phenomenon in which great powers brandish strength as a way to rule without really governing. It is also a sign that Washington&rsquo;s latest national security strategy should be taken at its word. Understood this way, the Trump Administration&rsquo;s posture becomes legible: Trump is not interested in destroying NATO but rather in using European anxiety about American abandonment as a cudgel to remake Europe.</p>



<p>Europeans will likely be able to defend themselves, but Europe has both a &ldquo;time problem&rdquo; and a &ldquo;political problem&rdquo;. They need to diminish their dependence on American technologies and weapons while simultaneously keeping Trump happy and preserving the illusion that Europe can rely on American military power. For Trump, Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine seems to represent an opportunity. Much as a private security company exploits rising risks to increase the cost of its services, Washington exploits European vulnerability and enjoys the attendant escalation of tension between Russia and its European allies.</p>



<p>Russians, for their part, regard Europe as the enemy and Trump as a natural ally. Lord Hasting Lionel Ismay, the British general and diplomat, who served as the first Secretary General of NATO,<a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/20855/summary"  target="_blank"> famously</a> remarked the purpose of the alliance was &ldquo;to keep the Americans in, the Soviets out and the Germans down.&rdquo; Russia&rsquo;s current strategy might be described as keeping the Americans in, the Europeans out and the Ukrainians down. Europeans ought to brace themselves for Trump&rsquo;s ongoing threats to annex Greenland&mdash;an act that would violate the territorial integrity of a NATO member state. There is a strong possibility that such an annexation&mdash;Trump&rsquo;s Crimea, as it were&mdash;could occur within this year.</p>



<p>European leaders spent a year trying to flatter Trump and promised to buy American weapons but his ultimatum to Europe to give up Greenland or face increased tariffs is<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-europe-allies-nato/"  target="_blank"> pushing</a> them against the wall. Describing Trump&rsquo;s behavior as crossing numerous &ldquo;red lines,&rdquo; Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/21/trump-greenland-europe-allies-nato/"  target="_blank"> remarked</a> that Europe has to make a choice and that &ldquo;being a happy vassal is one thing, being a miserable slave is something else.&rdquo; Europe will be forced to make this choice.</p>



<p>Europe still desperately needs NATO. And Europe&rsquo;s relevance in the world will depend on its readiness to live in a world without the Atlantic alliance. Any hope that Europeans will mobilize in face of dual threats from Trump and Putin is inspiring but unrealistic. According to a recent poll by the ECFR, 20% of respondents who view America as an adversary are also the least enthusiastic about increasing defense budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>European leaders should convince their publics that they understand the difference between playing the fool and being one. To be a fool is to believe that, despite evidence to the contrary, America will stand with Europe in case of a Russian invasion&mdash;or to believe that once Trump leaves office, the U.S. will regain its senses. Europe&rsquo;s major strategic challenge is to recollect the slogan: NATO is dead, long live NATO!</p>

<p>President Donald Trump said Wednesday he would not use force to <a href="https://time.com/7353359/trump-greenland-annexation-no-going-back-united-kingdom-argument/" >acquire Greenland</a>, the first time he has ruled out using military action to acquire the territory. </p>



<p>Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump lamented that the United States &ldquo;probably won&#8217;t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;But I won&#8217;t do that,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;That&#8217;s probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force. I don&#8217;t have to use force. I don&#8217;t want to use force. I won&#8217;t use force.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7353681/greenland-trump-threat-europe-nato-response/" ><em>The Five Ways Europe Could Respond to Trump&rsquo;s Greenland Threat</em></a></p>



<p>&ldquo;All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>The comments come amid a prolonged campaign by Trump to annex the island, which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.</p>



<p>That campaign has become increasingly confrontational in recent weeks, as Trump has insisted that <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925766187001811"  target="_blank">there was</a> &#8220;no going back&rdquo; on his push to acquire Greenland, which he has insisted is essential for U.S. national security. </p>



<p>In recent weeks, Trump has posted <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925897257210763"  target="_blank">a meme</a> showing pictures of the island draped in an American flag, and raised the example of the U.S. military&#8217;s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-venezuela-greenland-cuba-571aac35e259857fd512c46f5af11e4d"  target="_blank">removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro</a> when discussing his designs on Greenland, prompting fears that he may use military action to seize the territory.  </p>



<p>Trump&#8217;s aggressive posture prompted angst among European officials, and his appearance was preceded by a series of speeches condemning his ambitions to take the territory. On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron denounced what he described as a &#8220;new imperialism,&#8221; without mentioning Trump by name. </p>



<p>&#8220;We do prefer respect to bullies,&#8221; Macron said. &#8220;And we do prefer rule of law to brutality.&#8221;</p>



<p>Canada&#8217;s Prime Minister Mark Carney, similarly, did not say Trump&#8217;s name, but announced that the &#8220;rules-based order is fading.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Canadians know that our old, comfortable assumption that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security is no longer valid,&#8221; Carney said.</p>



<p>Trump&#8217;s pressure campaign over Greenland had ramped up ahead of Davos, escalating from words to action. </p>



<p>Over the weekend, he announced <a href="https://time.com/7347120/greenland-trump-protests-tariffs/" >tariffs on eight European countries</a>&mdash;and NATO allies&mdash; for taking part in military exercises on the island. </p>



<p>That in turn prompted threats of retaliatory economic measures from those countries, which were already subject to tariffs of 10% and 15%. European Union (E.U.) officials convened an emergency meeting to discuss a coordinated response. Some officials raised the prospect of abandoning the U.S.-E.U. trade deal struck last summer. The agreement includes $750 billion worth of energy purchases from the U.S., $600 billion in E.U. investment, and billions of dollars in reduced tariffs on imports from European countries.</p>



<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned during her speech at the World Economic Forum that the E.U.&rsquo;s response to the tariff threats will be &ldquo;unflinching, united and proportional.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;In politics as in business&mdash;a deal is a deal. And when friends shake hands, it must mean something,&rdquo; von der Leyen said. </p>



<p><em>This is a developing story.</em></p>

<p>President Donald Trump delivered a defiant and combative address at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, using the annual gathering of world leaders and business executives to tout America&rsquo;s role as the world&#8217;s main peacekeeper and economic engine, and make his most explicit case yet for the U.S. to acquire Greenland from Denmark.</p>



<p>Calling for &ldquo;immediate negotiations&rdquo; with Denmark, Trump asserted that <a href="https://time.com/7353681/greenland-trump-threat-europe-nato-response/" >Greenland</a> was essential to American and global security, even as he insisted he would not use military force to obtain it&mdash;his clearest effort yet to somewhat soften the threat behind a demand that has already <a href="http://Trump&rsquo;s Casual Indifference to NATO&rsquo;s Future Is Spooking the Western World"  target="_blank">unsettled NATO allies</a>.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;We probably won&rsquo;t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He added: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to use force. I don&rsquo;t want to use force. I won&rsquo;t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.&rdquo; Yet the President made clear that he still envisioned full American ownership of the semiautonomous Danish territory, arguing that &ldquo;you need the ownership to defend it&rdquo; and that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t defend it on a lease.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#8220;This enormous unsecured Island is actually part of North America, on the northern frontier of the Western Hemisphere,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;That&#8217;s our territory.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The comments underscored Trump&rsquo;s willingness to <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7345543/trump-foreign-policy-second-term/" >wield raw power and transactional threats</a> in pursuit of territorial and strategic gains&mdash;even at the risk of tearing at alliances that have anchored Western security since World War II. </p>



<p>While Trump insisted he did not intend to use force, he coupled that assurance with a thinly veiled warning: &ldquo;You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.&rdquo; That combination of conciliation and coercion came up repeatedly throughout Trump&rsquo;s remarks. He boasted of forcing NATO members to increase defense spending, even as he questioned whether they would come to America&rsquo;s aid if the United States were attacked. He described Europe as dependent on American protection but insufficiently grateful for it. &ldquo;The problem with NATO is that we&rsquo;ll be there for them 100%,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure that they&rsquo;d be there for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s speech, which lasted more than an hour, emphasized how dramatically his maximalist foreign policy has shifted the footing of those attending the annual World Economic Forum. Once a bastion of multilateralism and consensus-building, the forum this week revolved around a single question: how to navigate a world increasingly shaped by one leader&rsquo;s willingness to pressure allies as aggressively as rivals.</p>



<p>Trump began his remarks focused on delivering a triumphant verdict on his first year back in office, calling it &ldquo;the fastest and most dramatic economic turnaround in our country&rsquo;s history&rdquo; and claiming inflation had been &ldquo;defeated,&rdquo; the border rendered &ldquo;virtually impenetrable&rdquo; and growth set to surpass any previous benchmark. He contrasted his record with what he described as the &ldquo;nightmare of stagflation&rdquo; under former President Joe Biden whom he repeatedly derided as &ldquo;the autopen.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But what unfolded over the course of his lengthy speech was less a celebration of economic revival than a sweeping assertion of American dominance&mdash;and of his own role as its chief architect&mdash;over allies, adversaries and institutions alike.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The USA is the economic engine of the planet,&rdquo; Trump declared. &ldquo;And when America booms, the entire world booms.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Without us, right now you&#8217;d all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps,&rdquo; Trump said to the room full of billionaires, government officials, and diplomats.</p>



<p>Trump warned that &ldquo;certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,&rdquo; blaming &ldquo;unchecked mass migration,&rdquo; environmental policies, and the outsourcing of heavy industry for what he called the continent&rsquo;s decline. He criticized Europe multiple times, even as many of its leaders sat in the audience.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The more windmills a country has,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the more money that country loses.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He urged other nations to &ldquo;follow what we&rsquo;re doing&rdquo; while making clear that noncompliance would carry costs. He boasted of slashing regulations and cutting tariffs on domestic producers while raising them on foreign goods, and he claimed to have reduced the U.S. trade deficit dramatically while securing deals covering 40% of American trade.</p>



<p>The message resonated uneasily in Europe, where leaders have spent the past year struggling to navigate a more transactional and confrontational Washington. Emergency summits, retaliatory tariff planning, and quiet efforts to insulate European industries from American pressure have become a staple of the diplomatic calendar since Trump returned to office.</p>



<p>Nowhere was that tension clearer than when Trump turned to Greenland. &ldquo;No nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States,&rdquo; he said, recounting how American forces defended the island during World War II before returning it to Denmark, a decision he now questioned. &ldquo;How ungrateful are they now?&rdquo; he added. At various points, Trump appeared to confuse Greenland with Iceland. &ldquo;Iceland has already cost us a lot of money,&rdquo; he said, a reference to the stock market&rsquo;s recent dip. By the end of his address, the U.S. stock market had risen following his assurances that no military action would be used to acquire Greenland.</p>



<p>The comments came amid a growing rift with Denmark and other European governments, which have rejected any suggestion that the island could be sold or transferred. In recent weeks, Denmark has increased its military presence in Greenland, joined by Germany, Sweden and Norway.</p>



<p>The President&rsquo;s posture stood in sharp contrast to the thinly veiled condemnations of U.S. policy delivered on Tuesday in Davos by key European figures. Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada warned of a &ldquo;rupture&rdquo; in the world order, declaring that the rules-based international system was eroding and that &ldquo;the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.&rdquo; French President Emmanuel Macron decried the use of coercion and tariffs to advance territorial ambitions, asserting that Europe would not accept the &ldquo;law of the strongest&rdquo; or be intimidated by &ldquo;bullies.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump responded to their comments by singling out both leaders. He mocked Macron&rsquo;s sunglasses before recounting how he said he forced France&rsquo;s leader to narrow the gap between French and American drug prices by threatening sweeping tariffs. &ldquo;Emmanuel, you&rsquo;re going to do it, and you&rsquo;re going to do it fast,&rdquo; Trump said he told the French leader, recalling a threat to impose a 25% tariff on French goods and a 100% tariff on French wine and champagne if he did not comply. French officials have previously disputed aspects of his account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8203;&#8203;&ldquo;Canada gets a lot of freebies from us,&rdquo; Trump said, adding that it &ldquo;should be grateful&rdquo; to the United States. Referring directly to Carney&rsquo;s appearance at Davos, he said, &ldquo;I watched your Prime Minister yesterday. He wasn&rsquo;t so grateful.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Canada lives because of the United States,&rdquo; Trump added. &ldquo;Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The episodes served as a broader illustration of Trump&rsquo;s approach to diplomacy: not as a matter of quiet negotiation among allies, but as a series of public confrontations in which leverage is applied through the blunt use of American economic power.</p>



<p>At Davos, such remarks landed with particular force. Halfway through the speech, a senior Western European official told TIME: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t react to everything he says. We have our values and our interests, and we have to work with the U.S. to protect them. We have to talk. We listen; then we talk.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s speech also revisited long-standing grievances and disputed claims: that his 2020 election loss was &ldquo;rigged,&rdquo; that he had single-handedly settled eight wars in the past year, and that the war in Ukraine would never have happened had he remained in office.</p>



<p>He touted a deal with Venezuela over oil production, took credit for wiping out Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program, praised the expansion of U.S. nuclear and artificial intelligence infrastructure, and spoke admiringly of allowing private companies to build their own power plants. Throughout, Trump returned to a central theme: that American power, unapologetically wielded, was the ultimate guarantor of global stability.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We did a lot of big things, all perfectly executed,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>

<p>European leaders are bracing for an all-out trade war with the U.S. once again after President Trump <a href="https://time.com/7353359/trump-greenland-annexation-no-going-back-united-kingdom-argument/" >threatened</a> to impose a 10% tariff on imports from from countries that oppose his demand to take control of Greenland.</p>



<p>The potential tariff would put the U.S.-EU trade deal struck last summer in jeopardy. The agreement includes $750 billion worth of energy purchases from the U.S., $600 billion in EU investment, and billions of dollars in reduced tariffs on imports from European countries.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7347751/trump-letter-norway-store-nobel-peace-prize-obligation-greenland-war/" ><em>Trump Says No Need &lsquo;To Think Purely of Peace&rsquo; in Letter to Norway About Nobel Prize Loss, Greenland Ambitions</em></a></p>



<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned during her speech at the World Economic Forum that the EU&rsquo;s response to the tariff threats will be &ldquo;unflinching, united and proportional.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;In politics as in business&mdash;a deal is a deal. And when friends shake hands, it must mean something,&rdquo; von der Leyen said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump, however, remains adamant on taking over the Arctic island. In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump <a href="https://time.com/7353359/trump-greenland-annexation-no-going-back-united-kingdom-argument/" >said he had spoken</a> to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte regarding Greenland and told him that &ldquo;there can be no going back.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Here are five ways the European allies could respond to Trump&rsquo;s threat to acquire the island:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Retaliatory tariff</h2>



<p>The EU could respond by imposing a reciprocal tariff on a range of U.S. goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the trade negotiations last year, Brussels came up with a list of 4,800 types of U.S. exports to impose tariffs on, ranging from whiskey and soybeans to planes and cars, totaling <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2025/764382/ECTI_IDA(2025)764382_EN.pdf"  target="_blank">$108 billion</a>. The list will go into effect on Feb. 7 unless the European Parliament votes to freeze it.</p>



<p>Since Trump revived his interest in Greenland, the proposal to let the EU Parliament pass the tariffs has gained momentum. On Tuesday, France&#8217;s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said France supports the European Parliament&rsquo;s push to suspend the trade deal between the U.S. and EU.</p>



<p>Still, the European Commission Spokesperson Olof Gill said the current priority is still to engage and avoid the imposition of tariffs.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This will ultimately harm consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,&rdquo; Gill said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trade &ldquo;bazooka&rdquo;</h2>



<p>Another measure that the EU could take is activating the Anti-Coercion Instrument, also known as the &ldquo;trade bazooka.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The policy, which was adopted in late 2023, aims to deter foreign countries from blackmailing European countries through economic pressure. The &ldquo;trade bazooka&rdquo; is much more expansive than reciprocal tariffs, because it can not only impose additional tariffs, but also restrict imports and exports through quotas and licenses, limit access to direct investment in the EU&rsquo;s financial markets, or suspend intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Since the EU is America&rsquo;s largest commercial partner, this would cause substantial damage to the U.S. economy, most likely generating a US recession and a global downturn, as well as raising costs on many everyday staples,&rdquo; said Dan Hamilton, nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution&rsquo;s Center.</p>



<p>This is, however, the EU&rsquo;s last resort for countermeasures for multiple reasons. For one thing, it would take up to 10 months for the European Commission to investigate and determine whether there is any coercion and retaliation from the concerned country. It would also need a supermajority of 27 Parliament members to back the measure after the investigation, which could take a maximum of 10 weeks to deliberate. The bazooka has also never been used before, and some European countries, like Germany, are still looking for ways to deescalate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We simply want to try to resolve this problem together, and the American government knows that we could also retaliate,&rdquo; German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dumping U.S. assets</h2>



<p>European countries hold trillions of dollars in U.S. bonds and stocks. The EU could dump a huge amount of its assets to drive up the cost of borrowing and sink the U.S. financial market, adding more uncertainties to retirement account investments, running a business, and buying a home. But selling U.S. assets on a large scale is much harder to execute than it seems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the U.S. assets owned by the European countries are owned by private entities and not the government, according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/beeaf869-ca12-4178-95a1-bfb69ee27ae4"  target="_blank">FT</a>. Even if European governments can compel a sale of U.S. assets from their public wealth funds, it would also be hard to find a buyer who could absorb even a fraction of what the European countries own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More importantly, an abrupt sale of the U.S. assets would sink the value of the dollar and drive up the euro, which could quickly upend European countries&rsquo; own economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent brushed off this idea on Tuesday in Davos as a &ldquo;false narrative&rdquo; that &ldquo;defies any logic.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I am sure that the European governments will continue holding it and as I said, I think everyone needs to take a deep breath,&rdquo; Bessent said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Supreme Court</h2>



<p>Like many Americans, European leaders are also waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to deliberate on the legality of Trump&rsquo;s tariffs, with a ruling expected as soon as this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The White House argued that a national security law dating back to the 1970s&mdash;the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)&mdash;gives the President the authority to declare an emergency and slap down tariffs on his own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the case reached the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a 7-4 decision that none of the emergency powers granted the President under the IEEPA&nbsp; law &ldquo;explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties or the power to tax.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But regardless of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling, the Trump administration is determined to keep the tariffs. In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/us/politics/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-greer-trade.html"  target="_blank">interview with the New York Times</a> last Thursday, the U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Trump administration plans to begin replacing them almost immediately with other levies if the high court strikes down Trump&rsquo;s tariffs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Defending Greenland by force</h2>



<p>Despite Trump&rsquo;s suggestion of <a href="https://time.com/7347751/trump-letter-norway-store-nobel-peace-prize-obligation-greenland-war/" >seizing Greenland by force</a>, a military option remains unlikely. Still, Denmark, a NATO ally, has been boosting its military presence in the Arctic island in response to Trump&rsquo;s brinkmanship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Denmark&rsquo;s defense minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" >announced</a> that Denmark would increase military activity in and around Greenland, citing an increasingly unpredictable security environment. Several European NATO allies confirmed that they were also sending personnel to the island.</p>



<p>Asked on Monday whether he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump told NBC News &ldquo;no comment.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/china-living-alone.jpg" alt="Young man in China standing in front of a window looking into the distance, with a green park and modern skyscrapers outside."/>



<p>Tired from work and craving a sweet treat or a spa day? Young people in China have a new mantra for that: &ldquo;<em>Ai ni laoji</em>!&rdquo;</p>



<p>The phrase, meaning &ldquo;love you, dear friend,&rdquo; took off on Chinese social media at the end of last year as users tacked the phrase onto videos, posts, and comments to justify spending on the dearest friend of all: themselves.&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>It&rsquo;s a familiar concept to many outside of China: through the 2010s, Western social media was inundated with the phrase &ldquo;YOLO&rdquo; (You Only Live Once) and &ldquo;Treat Yo&rsquo;Self&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSjM5B3QNlw"  target="_blank">popularized by the sitcom <em>Parks and Recreation</em></a>&mdash;and in recent years, the concept of self-care has powered a booming wellness industry.</p>



<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/6271915/self-love-loneliness/" ><em>Self-Love Is Making Us Lonely</em></a></p>



<p>But the Chinese phrase reflects a starker generational shift in the East Asian nation of 1.4 billion, where older generations have long emphasized hard work and personal sacrifice and where younger generations are now struggling to build their lives according to traditional expectations amid a sluggish job economy and rapid urbanization.</p>



<p>The self-love memes resonate because of their irony, says Sylvia Zhu, a 25-year-old from Beijing who now lives in Seattle. Many of the stories people share online are &ldquo;about struggling in life and slowly getting through it by relying on yourself,&rdquo; which many young people in China can relate to, she says, adding that some of her friends have also started saying &ldquo;life is too short&rdquo; or &ldquo;you never know what will happen tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Zhu tells TIME that she and her friends in China enjoy spending on things for themselves like <a href="https://time.com/7271656/popmart-china-blindbox-labubu-designer-toys-genz-luxury-industry-revenue/" >Pop Mart&rsquo;s viral Labubu dolls</a>, personal luxuries like handbags, or hobby-related gear like camera lenses.</p>



<p>&ldquo;After I started working, I realized that to keep life feeling exciting, material things sometimes play a role,&rdquo; Zhu says. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s something you can afford, it&rsquo;s often seen as a self-reward.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The mentality is just one example of how young people in China are reacting and adapting to a fast-changing and often atomizing urban society. Ashley Dudarenok, who runs a China- and Hong Kong-based consumer research consultancy, tells TIME that these trends among China&rsquo;s Gen Z are a &ldquo;rational response&rdquo; to a hyper-competitive job market, stagnant wages, and rising costs of living.</p>



<p>&ldquo;When traditional markers of success like marriage and homeownership become structurally inaccessible for many, young people are forced to redefine what a &lsquo;good life&rsquo; means,&rdquo; Dudarenok says. &ldquo;If they cannot afford a house, they can at least afford to treat themselves to a nice meal or a Pop Mart toy that brings them joy.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Modern anxieties</h2>



<p>Chinese families have traditionally lived close to each other, at times with several generations living under one roof. But in recent decades, many Chinese, especially younger generations, have left their homes in rural areas to live and work in big cities like Beijing and Chongqing.</p>



<p>The country has seen a dramatic rise in people living alone, with more than 100 million single-person households, according to an annual report from the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2024, a number that is <a href="https://research.ke.com/121/ArticleDetail?id=413"  target="_blank">estimated</a> to reach 150 to 200 million by 2030.</p>



<p>&ldquo;People enjoy having their own space and being able to live at their own pace without family pressure,&rdquo; Zhu says, but living alone &ldquo;can also be isolating, especially in big cities where social connections can feel shallow.&rdquo;</p>



<p>That reality has also fueled a surge of products and services catering to people living alone, including <a href="https://time.com/7336909/eating-alone-solo-dining-bans-loneliness-restaurants-adapt-single-economy/" >restaurants catering to solo diners</a>, a fast-growing <a href="https://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/knowledge/article/inside-china-pet-market-boom/"  target="_blank">pet market</a>, and even <a href="https://english.news.cn/20250601/65e9ecff89de4a689136ea949fcda488/c.html"  target="_blank">AI pets</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Rapid urbanization and the rise of the digital economy have created a new social landscape,&rdquo; says Dudarenok. The Chinese government has <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1018050"  target="_blank">taken steps</a> to regulate AI companions amid global concern over AI-fueled psychotic delusions and self-harm. The move, Dudarenok adds, is &ldquo;recognition that these new forms of companionship and social interaction are becoming a permanent feature of Chinese society.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The app &ldquo;<em>Si le ma</em>&rdquo;&mdash;Are you dead yet?&mdash;has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-are-you-dead-yet-app/"  target="_blank">attracted worldwide attention</a> as it&rsquo;s become one of the most downloaded apps in China in recent weeks. It has just one function: users tap a button on their phones everyday as virtual proof of life to their social network. If a user fails to do so for two consecutive days, the app automatically sends an email to a chosen emergency contact.</p>



<p>Ian L&uuml;, one of the app developers, told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/app-tech-death-china-elderly-living-alone-163f051b9108b93b0356c4e9aa01c1ef"  target="_blank">Associated Press</a> that the app serves as an effortless way to let your loved ones know that you&rsquo;re safe.</p>



<p>But to Zhu, who lives across the globe from her family, the app&rsquo;s popularity is proof that social isolation has become an accepted reality. The idea of living, and dying, alone may be most closely associated with the elderly, but the app is largely marketed to the young.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It reflects a sense that young people also feel they could die at any time while living alone, and that because of isolation, friends or family might not notice or do regular wellness checks,&rdquo; Zhu says. &ldquo;Rather than making me feel more secure, it shows how lonely and disconnected modern life can be, even for people who are young.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The app may take a unique approach but it addresses a phenomenon that is not unique to China, underscored by its popularity in places like Singapore, the U.K., India, the Netherlands, and the U.S., and by the wave of copycat apps that has followed. Last week, the app&rsquo;s developers said they planned to change its name to &ldquo;Demumu&rdquo;&mdash;a portmanteau of the word &ldquo;death&rdquo; and the babble-like naming pattern of Labubu&mdash;to cater more to a global market. The announcement disappointed many users, who have commented on social media that they could connect with the matter-of-fact name. Developers said they would crowdsource name suggestions in exchange for a 666 yuan ($96) reward.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Some netizens say that the &lsquo;Are you dead?&rsquo; greeting feels like a carefree joke between close friends&mdash;it&rsquo;s both heartfelt and gives a sense of unguarded ease,&rdquo; writer He Tao wrote in a <a href="https://www.yicai.com/news/103000298.html"  target="_blank">commentary</a> for Yicai, the Chinese Business Network. &ldquo;It likely explains why so many young people unanimously like this app.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Whether or not young people in China are actually concerned about a premature death, He wrote, the app&rsquo;s success &ldquo;serves as a darkly humorous social metaphor, reminding us to pay attention to the living conditions and inner world of contemporary young people. Those who downloaded it clearly need more than just a functional security measure; they crave a signal of being seen and understood.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&lsquo;Reshaping&rsquo; traditional values</h2>



<p>The individualism taking form among Chinese youth is different from the &ldquo;rugged, self-reliant individualism often associated with the West,&rdquo; Dudarenok says. &ldquo;Chinese youth are not necessarily breaking from their families or culture,&rdquo; but &ldquo;they are carving out more space for personal expression and emotional needs within those structures.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, which begins this year on Feb. 17, is the most significant holiday in China, and it has historically centered on family and relatives. That view hasn&rsquo;t changed among young people, according to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QSf6tqHbrqlxo_GtFGM_eg"  target="_blank">2025 survey</a> of Gen Z&rsquo;s attitudes towards the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, but some of their ways of celebrating it have. More than a third of the nearly 6,000 respondents said they spend more time socializing online than in person during the holiday, while digital traditions like sending virtual hongbaos or red packets and celebrating with &ldquo;cyber relatives&rdquo;&mdash;group chats, online communities, and even influencers that young people digitally &ldquo;visit&rdquo; during the festive period&mdash;have become more popular.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The tradition is still there, but the social unit has shifted from family to chosen communities,&rdquo; says Zhu. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less about rejecting tradition and more about reshaping it.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Many young people in China also value the holiday for more personal reasons, with the extended eight-day break from work or school ranking as their top reason to celebrate, according to the survey. Around half of the respondents also said they spend more during the holiday, particularly on livestream shopping or gaming.</p>



<p>The self-love memes are just another example of how young people are rewriting traditional values.</p>



<p>For older generations, &ldquo;self-love had to be earned,&rdquo; Zeng Yuli wrote about the trend in an <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1018043"  target="_blank">op-ed</a> for Chinese magazine Sixth Tone.</p>



<p>&ldquo;If you wanted to treat yourself, you had better first finish the project, get a promotion, or reach your weight loss goals,&rdquo; Zeng wrote. But among China&rsquo;s younger generations, &ldquo;regardless of your success, <em>laoji</em> still deserves compassion, is still worth that milk tea or hotpot, and is still allowed an afternoon of doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Familial expectations are still there, Zhu says. The survey notes that young people, especially young women, find themselves overwhelmed by questions about their careers or marriage at family gatherings during the Lunar New Year. The country&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-19/china-birthrate-hits-lowest-since-1949-in-blow-to-baby-drive"  target="_blank">birthrate fell 17% last year to the lowest level</a> since 1949 when the People&rsquo;s Republic of China was established, in spite of <a href="https://time.com/7340374/china-condom-contraceptive-tax-birth-rate-natalist-policies/" >government efforts to encourage couples to have children</a>.</p>

<p>But increasingly, those pressures are butting heads with an economic reality that is pushing many young people to reconsider what success means for them. A <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-d2b9f71d73219b32d78709b0afb443ca"  target="_blank">growing &ldquo;lie flat&rdquo; movement</a> of young people in China are choosing a &ldquo;low-desire life,&rdquo; moving out of big cities to more rural areas or even out of the country, and rejecting the common grueling work hours of &ldquo;9 9 6,&rdquo; or 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.</p>



<p>For Zhu&rsquo;s parents, success &ldquo;means stability: owning a home, having a stable career, getting married, and raising children.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;success is more about personal fulfillment and mental well-being. Having financial independence, time for hobbies, meaningful relationships, and a sense of freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eight years ago, when President Donald Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum in his first term, the alpine gathering of billionaires and heads of state waited nervously to hear how a self-described nationalist would address a temple of globalization. He <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2018/01/president-donald-trumps-davos-address-in-full-8e14ebc1-79bb-4134-8203-95efca182e94/"  target="_blank">told the audience</a> that &ldquo;America First&rdquo; did not mean &ldquo;America alone,&rdquo; boasted about tax cuts and deregulation, and charmed many in the room into seeing him as a pro-business disrupter rather than a threat to the postwar order.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>On Wednesday, as Trump prepares to take the Davos stage for the third time, the world is once again waiting nervously&mdash;but for very different reasons.</p>



<p>His return to the World Economic Forum comes amid an extraordinary standoff with U.S. allies over his threats to <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" >seize Greenland from Denmark</a>, a widening trans-Atlantic trade dispute, and growing alarm among world leaders that the United States has become an <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7345543/trump-foreign-policy-second-term/" >unpredictable and coercive power</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s address will be the first major speech of the second year of his second term, coming as his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trumps-approval-rating-takes-hit-first-year-back-office-rcna253192"  target="_blank">approval ratings</a> have slipped at home and <a href="https://time.com/7345243/ice-protests-renee-good/" >backlash</a> has grown over proliferating immigration raids by federal agents. It is also shaping up to be a defining moment for a presidency that has alienated U.S. allies to an unprecedented degree. It will test whether Trump still sees value in reassuring allies&mdash;as he did in 2018&mdash;or whether he now intends to formalize a doctrine of coercion, using tariffs and threats of territorial acquisition to bend partners to his will.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked on Tuesday for a preview of his address in Davos, Trump told reporters in the White House briefing room that he plans to project American dominance. &ldquo;I think more than anything else what I&#8217;m going to be speaking about is the tremendous success that we&#8217;ve had in one year,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>World leaders began the week in Davos with thinly veiled denunciations of Trump&rsquo;s conduct. Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada warned on Tuesday of a &ldquo;rupture&rdquo; in the world order and the end of a &ldquo;pleasant fiction&rdquo; in which great powers were constrained by rules. President Emmanuel Macron of France said that Europe would not submit to &ldquo;bullies&rdquo; and preferred &ldquo;the rule of law to brutality.&rdquo; Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, argued that Europe must build a new form of independence and deepen trade ties with partners beyond the United States.</p>



<p>None of them mentioned Trump by name. None needed to.</p>



<p>Their remarks came hours after Trump posted an AI-generated image showing himself hoisting an American flag in Greenland, labeled &ldquo;U.S. Territory. Est. 2026,&rdquo; and shared what appeared to be private text messages from Macron and Mark Rutte, NATO&rsquo;s secretary general, praising his leadership and seeking a way forward on the crisis.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Greenland is imperative for National and World Security,&rdquo; Trump wrote in one post. &ldquo;There can be no going back.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Greenland standoff has upended the opening days of a forum that had been expected to largely focus on artificial intelligence, economic growth, and climate change. European leaders have scrambled to update their Davos talking points to try and contain a confrontation that threatens to rupture NATO.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Nostalgia will not bring back the old order,&rdquo; von der Leyen said on Tuesday. &ldquo;If this change is permanent, then Europe must change permanently too.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In recent days, Denmark and its NATO partners have taken <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" >visible steps</a> to reinforce their presence in Greenland, sending hundreds of soldiers to the island. Greenland&rsquo;s leaders said they were reviewing civil preparedness plans, including advice that households might need five days of food supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking in Davos on Tuesday, world leaders appeared to brace for Trump&rsquo;s address. Carney said medium-size countries would have to band together because &ldquo;if you are not at the table, we&rsquo;re on the menu.&rdquo; Macron warned against &ldquo;vassalization&rdquo; and said Europe would not accept the law of the strongest.</p>



<p>Those remarks landed against the backdrop of Trump&rsquo;s increasingly mocking posture toward allied leaders. He dismissed Macron as irrelevant, predicted he would soon be out of office, and threatened tariffs of up to 200% on French wine and Champagne. He ridiculed Britain for agreeing to cede sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius&mdash;a deal his Administration previously praised, but now cites as another reason the U.S. must acquire Greenland.</p>



<p>The confrontations have made Trump the inescapable topic of a gathering that bills itself as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/world-economic-forum/"  target="_blank">Committed to Improving the State of the World</a>.&rdquo; Some 3,000 participants from 130 countries have descended on the Swiss resort town, including 65 heads of state and 850 major corporate executives, according to forum organizers.</p>



<p>The Trump Administration is touting this year&rsquo;s U.S. delegation as its largest and most senior delegation in Davos history, with five Cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, alongside Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law Jared Kushner and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. A sprawling &ldquo;USA House&rdquo; has taken over storefronts along the main promenade, offering a visual display of American power.</p>



<p>A White House official said the President would emphasize that the United States and Europe must leave behind &ldquo;economic stagnation&rdquo; and the policies that caused it, and that housing affordability would remain a chief focus&mdash;a message aimed at domestic audiences struggling with the cost of living.</p>



<p>But Trump will likely also boast about projecting U.S. power abroad, including the recent capture of Venezuela&rsquo;s president, Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, and his efforts to stop foreign wars.</p>



<p>He is also expected to expand the remit of his &ldquo;Board of Peace,&rdquo; a new organization initially billed as overseeing Gaza&rsquo;s reconstruction, into a more expansive global body that some allies fear is designed to rival the United Nations&mdash;with Trump holding veto power over its decisions. The charter-signing ceremony is scheduled for Thursday at Davos, with invited leaders facing a choice that has become emblematic of their week at the conference: align with Trump or risk being targeted by him. France has already said it will not join the board, and other European governments are deeply skeptical, worried the initiative could undermine the U.N. system.<br>Democratic governors, including <a href="https://time.com/7353366/newsom-trump-advice-to-world-leaders/" >Gavin Newsom of California</a>, have accused world leaders of failing to stand up to Trump and warned Europeans not to capitulate. &ldquo;You mate with him or he devours you,&rdquo; Newsom said from Davos.</p>

<p>Leaders from Dow Chemical Company, EY, and NTT Data Inc. shared their perspectives on the impact of scaling up new technologies like AI during a TIME100 Talks panel discussion in Davos on Jan. 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel took place on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s annual meeting, which kicked off on Jan. 19 in Davos, drawing around 3,000 high-level participants from business, government, and beyond, in addition to many more observers, journalists, activists, and others.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>During the panel, titled &ldquo;Innovation in a Multipolar Era,&rdquo; the participants discussed the benefits of integrating AI, and its potential in areas such as health care and education, as well as some of the challenges of integrating the technology at scale within businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&hellip;see enormous benefits, whether it&#8217;s discovery of new materials, new drugs, or tech-driven productivity,&rdquo; said Abhijit Dubey, CEO and chief artificial intelligence officer at NTT Data. &ldquo;But at the same time we really have to watch out for what we&#8217;re doing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that, unlike all other innovations before it, AI is the &ldquo;first technology that will actually be non-human driven.&rdquo; Not only can this lead to unexpected outcomes, but the technology requires vast amounts of energy and water, in addition to mining of rare earth minerals that are in some cases leading to <a href="https://time.com/7344877/trump-greenland-annexation-threats-purchase-national-security-economic/" >tensions over resources</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another concern is the &ldquo;paradox of massive abundance at the same time [as] a massive market labor dislocation,&rdquo; said Dubey, noting it is &ldquo;something that we really have to watch out for.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The pain is not the destination, it is in the transition,&rdquo; added Debra Bauler, chief information and digital officer at Dow, who explained how the company is approaching its workforce during the AI transition. &ldquo;We think about the way we work with our team members. We also want to move them from doers of tasks to directors of systems,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There will be job impacts, but we also think where we&#8217;re going, the destination is worth this transition period.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In any tech transition, when it comes to jobs, &ldquo;you lose one, you generate one-to-two,&rdquo; noted Dubey. Protecting those who are negatively impacted can&rsquo;t be entirely left up to the private sector, he argued. In addition to publicly backed mechanisms like <a href="https://time.com/6097523/compton-universal-basic-income/" >universal basic income</a>, he noted that a solution to generate funding that has been discussed would be imposing a tax on AI agents, the same way people are taxed. &ldquo;There have to be structural mechanisms that need to be thought through right now, because we can&rsquo;t do this reactively on the spot,&rdquo; he said, adding, &ldquo;There&#8217;s no government in the world that&#8217;s set up to do this.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Raj Sharma, global managing partner for growth and innovation at EY, said that in order for AI to usher in an era of what he has called &ldquo;super-fluid enterprises,&rdquo; the key ingredients would be trust, tools, and talent. &ldquo;You have to balance the equation between [the] three to make sure that AI is adopted.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256659142.jpg" alt="Opening Day Of World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026"/>



<p>California&rsquo;s Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a strong message to global leaders on Tuesday, urging them to take a stand against <a href="https://time.com/7353359/trump-greenland-annexation-no-going-back-united-kingdom-argument/" >President Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;People are rolling over. I should have brought a bunch of kneepads for all the world leaders,&rdquo; Newsom told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just pathetic.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Newsom made reference to Venezuelan opposition leader Mar&iacute;a Corina Machado <a href="https://time.com/7346654/machado-trump-meeting-nobel-prize-venezuela/" >regifting</a> her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump during a visit to the White House last week and said the behavior around the President is &ldquo;embarrassing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Democratic Governor&mdash;who is <a href="https://time.com/7337996/newsom-mock-health-report-trump-mri-results-medical-records-controversy/" >a long-time adversary of Trump&rsquo;s</a>&mdash;urged European lawmakers to &ldquo;stop being complicit&rdquo; and &ldquo;have a backbone.&rdquo; Newsom&#8217;s comments come amid tense international discussions after Trump threatened to tariff European allies until Denmark agrees to sell Greenland to the U.S.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Europeans should decide for themselves what to do, but one thing they can&rsquo;t do is what they&rsquo;ve been doing. They&#8217;ve been played. This guy [Trump] is playing folks for fools,&rdquo; said Newsom, referring to Trump as a &ldquo;T-Rex.&rdquo;</p>



<p>You either &ldquo;mate with him or he devours you,&rdquo; he quipped.</p>



<p>Amid mounting backlash from European leaders, Trump revealed he is set to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and others at Davos, although he warned there is &ldquo;no going back&rdquo; on his plan.</p>



<p>Trump has also refused to rule out the possibility of leaving NATO in order to carry out his Greenland ambitions. Should the President pursue that avenue, the legalities involved are, at best, murky, <a href="https://time.com/7346819/can-trump-pull-united-states-out-of-nato-legal-experts/" >experts told TIME.</a> Trump declared on Tuesday that &ldquo;no person or President&rdquo; has done more for NATO than himself. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t come along, there would be no NATO right now! It would have been in the ash heap of history,&rdquo; he claimed.</p>



<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Trump has clashed with NATO or E.U. officials since returning to the White House.</p>



<p>Trump has often criticized European allies over discussions about Russia. Following a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing in September, during which Ukrainian allies committed security guarantees to President Volodymyr Zelensky, <a href="https://time.com/7314566/zelensky-trump-ukraine-america-security-guarantees-russia-conflict/" >Trump cited concerns</a> with European purchases of Russian oil, a White House official told TIME. The President insisted European leaders must put more economic pressure on China, arguing that Beijing funds Russia&rsquo;s war efforts.</p>



<p>There have also been repeated clashes over tariffs&mdash;a matter that has come to the forefront once more following Trump&#8217;s most recent threat.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Europe responds to Trump at Davos</strong></h2>



<p>As the world looks to Europe to make its next move, president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, during a speech in Davos on Tuesday, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_26_150"  target="_blank">championed</a> &ldquo;European independence&rdquo; and said Europe is the right place to invest.</p>



<p>Concluding her address, von der Leyen made reference to the escalating row over Greenland and Trump&rsquo;s insistence that the U.S. must acquire it as a matter of &ldquo;national security.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;When it comes to the security of the Arctic region, Europe is fully committed. And we share the objectives of the United States in this regard,&rdquo; said von der Leyen, noting that Finland recently <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/10/dhs-celebrates-purchase-new-coast-guard-icebreakers-president-trump-signs-deal"  target="_blank">completed a sale</a> of icebreaker vessels to the U.S., the first deal of its kind.</p>



<p>When French President Emmanuel Macron took to the Davos stage some time later, he echoed von der Leyen&rsquo;s statements about the strength of Europe, calling it a &ldquo;good place.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But Macron took his defence of Europe a step further and appeared to follow Newsom&#8217;s playbook by calling out Trump&#8217;s trade strategy.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We do prefer respect to bullies, we do prefer science to politicism, and we do prefer rule of law to brutality,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>Macron&mdash;who wore sunglasses throughout his speech, reportedly due to a burst blood vessel in his eye&mdash;went on to warn world leaders, saying &ldquo;conflict has become normalized&rdquo; and the current state of geopolitics is one in which &ldquo;the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a shift towards a world without effective collective governance,&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HCXGMMXDc"  target="_blank">said Macron</a>. &ldquo;It&#8217;s clearly a very concerning time, because we are killing the structure where we can fix the situation and the common challenges we have without collective governance.&rdquo;</p>



<p>On international trade, the French President took aim directly at the U.S., describing Trump&rsquo;s policies as ones that &ldquo;undermine our [European] export interests, demand maximum concessions and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Macron said that industries in Europe, such as chemical and automotive sectors, &ldquo;are being literally killed by the lack of respect for a normal framework and [a] level playing field.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255276568.jpg" alt="US-POLITICS-TRUMP"/>



<p>President Donald Trump doubled down on his pressure campaign for the <a href="https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/" >annexation of Greenland</a>, arguing there&#8217;s &ldquo;no going back&rdquo; on his ambitions despite the global backlash.</p>



<p>After Monday saw several world leaders denounce the President&rsquo;s threat to tariff European allies until Denmark agrees to sell the island to the U.S., Trump said he had shared a &ldquo;very good&rdquo; call with NATO chief Mark Rutte and unveiled plans for an upcoming meeting to discuss the escalating row.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for national and world security. There can be no going back&mdash;on that, everyone agrees,&rdquo; <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925766187001811"  target="_blank">claimed</a> Trump, adding that the U.S. is the &ldquo;only power that can ensure peace throughout the world&mdash;and it is done, quite simply, through strength.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Further details of the upcoming meeting were not provided, although Trump is due to deliver a speech at the 2026 World Economic Forum at Davos-Klosters on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Greenland and Denmark have both repeatedly said that the Arctic island is not for sale, with Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen stating last week: &ldquo;If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.&rdquo; Yet Trump has shown no signs of retreating and, in a move that has concerned leaders across the globe, the White House has refused to rule out using military force to annex the territory.</p>



<p>Greenland&#8217;s positioning between the U.S., Russia, and Europe makes it a strong geopolitical asset, and Trump has argued that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect the island from Russian and Chinese interests.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/greenland-trump.jpg" alt="Smartphone Displays Donald Trump Post on Truth Social About Greenland" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Several European countries last week, amid an effort from NATO allies to bolster the security of the island, committed to sending troops to Greenland for military exercises. Trump responded by saying <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115911344443637897"  target="_blank">he would impose</a> a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and the United Kingdom starting Feb. 1 &ldquo;on any and all goods sent to the United States of America.&rdquo; He said the tariff would be increased to 25% on June 1.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s use of economic pressure prompted outrage among not only European leaders but also some lawmakers within the President&rsquo;s own <a href="https://time.com/7352424/republicans-denounce-trump-greenland-tariffs-threat-america-risk/" >Republican Party, who labeled the tariffs </a>&ldquo;unnecessary, punitive, and a profound mistake.&rdquo;</p>



<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered a rare, public rebuke of Trump&rsquo;s actions during a filmed address at Downing Street on Monday morning. Although he emphasized the close alliance between the U.S. and the U.K., <a href="https://time.com/7349367/trump-greenland-tariff-threats-europe-fallout-starmer/" >Starmer said the President&rsquo;s tariffs threat was &ldquo;completely wrong.&rdquo;</a> Such moves are &ldquo;not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland&rsquo;s security as a justification for economic pressure,&rdquo; he argued.</p>



<p>Unlike some European leaders who have floated the idea of retaliatory tariffs or invoking the Anti-Coercion Instrument (which could restrict access to the single market in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc and block applications for E.U. contracts), Starmer expressed an eagerness to de-escalate tensions. &ldquo;A trade war is in no one&rsquo;s interest,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p>While Starmer appeared hopeful that &ldquo;calm discussion between allies&rdquo; would pave the way forward, Trump&mdash;during his overnight social media blitz&mdash;lambasted one of the U.K.&rsquo;s current geopolitical moves and used it as a touchstone to emphasize his Greenland argument.</p>



<p>Trump labeled the U.K.&#8217;s plan to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius &ldquo;an act of great stupidity.&rdquo; The U.K. acquired the islands for around &pound;3m ($4m) in 1968, but Mauritius leadership argued it was illegally forced to give away the land in order to get independence from Britain. Per the new deal, which was signed last year, the U.K. will <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-secures-future-of-vital-diego-garcia-military-base-to-protect-national-security#:~:text=Diego%20Garcia%20is%20the%20largest,the%20Indian%20Ocean%20and%20beyond."  target="_blank">lease back a key military base.</a> (Diego Garcia of the Chagos Islands is currently home to a strategic U.K.-U.S. military base.)</p>



<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are international powers who only recognize strength,&rdquo; said Trump, adding that the action from the U.K. is &ldquo;another in a very long line of national security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired. Denmark and its European allies have to do the right thing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In response to Trump&rsquo;s remarks, a U.K. government official told TIME: &ldquo;The U.K. will never compromise on our national security. We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future.&rdquo;</p>



<p>They added the deal &ldquo;has been publicly welcomed by the U.S., Australia, and all other Five Eyes allies, as well as key international partners including India, Japan, and South Korea.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257184524.jpg" alt="Trump Criticises Chagos Islands Handover" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, in a further display of his Greenland ambitions, Trump posted a digitally-created <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925897257210763"  target="_blank">depiction</a> of himself, joined by Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, planting an American flag beside a sign that reads &ldquo;Greenland, U.S. territory, EST. 2026.&rdquo; He also posted an image of himself in the Oval Office last year with several European leaders, including Starmer. However, the <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115925888562624963"  target="_blank">image</a> had been digitally-altered so that it showed Trump presenting a fake map of Greenland cloaked with the U.S. flag.</p>



<p>Shortly after Trump&rsquo;s online remarks, amid increasingly high tensions, U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson addressed the U.K. Parliament on Tuesday morning &ldquo;in honor of America&rsquo;s Semiquincentennial celebration.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s the first U.S. Speaker of the House to do so. Standing next to U.K. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Johnson acknowledged the politically-charged backdrop of his visit and expressed his hope to &ldquo;help to calm the waters.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve always been able to work through our differences, calmly as friends. We will continue to do that. I want to assure you this morning that that is still the case,&rdquo; Johnson told British lawmakers.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>When President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/as-iran-protesters-face-ruthless-crackdown-trump-says-help-on-its-way"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">promised Iranian protesters</a> that &ldquo;help is on its way,&rdquo; he probably didn&rsquo;t anticipate how those words would trap him. Human rights groups are estimating the number of Iranian protesters killed as ranging from &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/16/world/middleeast/iran-protests-deadly-crackdown.html"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">more than 2,600 people</a>&rdquo; to &ldquo;more than 3,400 people&rdquo; and CBS News is reporting the death toll as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-protest-death-toll-over-12000-feared-higher-video-bodies-at-morgue/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">at least 12,000</a>, and possibly as many as 20,000 people.&rdquo; Trump faces a choice that may define his second term: strike Iran militarily, pursue a hasty nuclear deal, or watch as the regime he threatened to overthrow <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/16/world/middleeast/iran-protests-deadly-crackdown.html"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">stabilizes</a> itself through mass violence.</p>



<p>The cold arithmetic of politics suggests none of these options end well. The real cost may be measured in something less tangible: the credibility of American promises to people who risk everything. We may never know whether Trump&rsquo;s words emboldened these particular protesters but dissidents who rise up in the next upheaval&mdash;whether in Iran or elsewhere&mdash;will remember that as makeshift morgues were overflowing in Iran, the American assistance that had been promised did not arrive. </p>



<p>And the world is watching.</p>



<p>From my years covering the aftermath of America&rsquo;s Iraq intervention, I have learned that the space between bold declarations and workable strategy is often filled with the lives of people we claim to want to save. Trump&rsquo;s rhetoric has raised expectations while simultaneously narrowing his own room for maneuver. The regime in Tehran, meanwhile, has called his bluff by doing exactly what he warned them not to do&mdash;and doing it with staggering brutality.</p>



<p>The deployment of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-uss-abraham-lincoln-path-toward-iran-protests-continue-11371804"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln</a>&nbsp;carrier strike group to the Middle East signals Washington&rsquo;s seriousness. But seriousness about what, exactly? Here&rsquo;s where the president&rsquo;s predicament becomes painfully clear: the Trump Administration hasn&rsquo;t decided whether it wants to overthrow the Iranian regime or negotiate with it. These are fundamentally incompatible objectives, yet the Trump team is pursuing both simultaneously.</p>



<p>Steve Witkoff, the president&rsquo;s special envoy, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/mena/2026/01/16/iran-protests-trump-witkoff/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">publicly stated</a>&nbsp;that he hopes for &ldquo;a diplomatic resolution&rdquo; while outlining demands that Iran reduce its enriched uranium stockpile, curtail missile development, and abandon regional proxies. These are reasonable goals but Iran has spent four decades building its security architecture around precisely these capabilities. Hawks like Secretary of State Marco Rubio argue the regime&rsquo;s lack of credibility makes any deal worthless. Both positions have merit. Neither resolves the fundamental question: what does America want the day after tomorrow in Iran?</p>



<p>Israel <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-iran-protests-what-options-does-us-have-to-respond/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">and</a> the Gulf Arab countries&mdash;despite their profound hostility toward Tehran&mdash;are privately urging caution, telling the Trump Administration that the Iranian regime may not be weakened enough for military strikes to deliver the decisive blow. Trump faces a strategic bind. A limited strike would accomplish little beyond giving the Iranian regime a nationalist rallying cry and potentially salvaging its tattered legitimacy. A comprehensive military campaign would require sustained operations, risk massive civilian casualties, endanger U.S. forces across the region, and almost certainly draw Israel into direct confrontation with Iran.</p>



<p>Consider what we know about the Iranian regime&rsquo;s crackdown on the protesters.  Verified videos <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2026/01/iran-massacre-of-protesters-demands-global-diplomatic-action-to-signal-an-end-to-impunity/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">show</a> improvised morgues filled with hundreds of body bags. Hospitals report being overwhelmed with gunshot victims. The regime imposed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/15/nx-s1-5678539/iran-protests-trump"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">an internet blackout</a> to obscure the scale of violence, and has admitted to around 2,000 deaths. Even the <a href="https://iranhr.net/en/articles/8529/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">lower estimates</a> of number of protesters killed in Iran exceed the death toll in any previous crackdown on protests in the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s history.</p>



<p>This represents&nbsp;a fundamental break between the Iranian state and its citizens. When a government kills thousands of its own people for protesting economic conditions, it crosses a threshold from which there&rsquo;s no easy return. The Islamic Republic has weathered protests before by mixing repression with tactical concessions. This time, it has chosen only repression&mdash;and at a scale that makes reconciliation impossible.</p>



<p>We have seen this dynamic before. In Syria after 2011, Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s regime made a similar calculation: total violence now to prevent uncertain outcomes later. It worked, in the sense that Assad survived. It also created a country that will never be whole again, where hatred of the government became a defining feature of an entire generation.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s promise that &ldquo;help is on its way&rdquo; now rings hollow. When a U.S. president makes threats and fails to follow through, adversaries adjust their calculations. When he makes promises to people in the streets and abandons them, they remember&mdash;and so do people in the next country, facing the next dictator.</p>



<p>The history of American rhetoric versus action in the Middle East is long and bitter. Iraqis remember when President George H.W. Bush encouraged them to rise up against Saddam Hussein in 1991, then watched as Saddam&rsquo;s helicopters massacred tens of thousands of Shiites. Syrians remember when President Barack Obama declared that Assad must go, then did nothing as red lines were crossed. Now Iranians are learning the same lesson.</p>



<p>American power in the region rests partly on military capability but equally on the perception that Washington means what it says. Every unfulfilled promise weakens that foundation. Trump may believe he is being prudent. History may judge him correct. But protesters who believed him will draw different conclusions.</p>



<p>Yet&nbsp;the brute reality is&nbsp;that following through might be worse. The Trump Administration has no clear theory of victory. Limited strikes won&rsquo;t achieve regime change. Comprehensive military action could destabilize the entire region without guaranteeing a better Iran emerges from the rubble. This leaves negotiations, which Iran has reportedly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/12/iran-protests-witkoff-araghchi-call-trump-threats"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">initiated</a>&nbsp;through back channels.&nbsp;But past negotiations foundered on less ambitious demands.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Iranian regime is doing what authoritarian governments do: surviving. The protests have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/15/nx-s1-5678539/iran-protests-trump"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">subsided</a>&nbsp;underwhelming force. Security forces are conducting door-to-door searches, confiscating satellite dishes to identify protesters. This grinding machinery of repression is brutally effective in the short term.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s fundamental problem is that he has created expectations he cannot fulfil without costs he may not be willing to pay. His own advisors can&rsquo;t agree on what intervention would accomplish. And the carrier group steaming toward the Persian Gulf signals capability without clarity of purpose.</p>



<p>This is why doing nothing may be Trump&rsquo;s hardest choice&mdash;not because it is wrong, but because it contradicts everything he has said. The president who promised that &ldquo;help is on its way&rdquo; now confronts the oldest lesson of Middle East interventions: dramatic promises are easier to make than strategic outcomes are to achieve.</p>



<p>From Baghdad, I learned that wars begin with clarity and end in confusion. Trump&rsquo;s Iran policy seems to have started with confusion. Every day of indecision is a day the regime uses to consolidate control. The protesters deserved better. So did U.S. foreign policy. Trump&rsquo;s promise may prove more damaging than his silence would have been.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/greenland-trump.jpg" alt="Smartphone Displays Donald Trump Post on Truth Social About Greenland"/>



<p>President Donald Trump shared what appeared to be a message from French President Emmanuel Macron questioning his moves on Greenland amid the Trump Administration&rsquo;s renewed push to take control of the territory.</p>



<p>&ldquo;My friend, We are totally in line on Syria. We can do great things on Iran,&rdquo; read the message, which was attached as a screenshot to Trump&rsquo;s Truth Social <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925848634299232"  target="_blank">post</a> late Monday night, early Tuesday. &ldquo;I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Macron also offered to host a G7 meeting in Paris after the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Let us try to build great things : 1) i can set up a g7 meeting after Davos in Paris on thursday afternoon. I can invite the ukrainians, the danish, the syrians and the russians in the margins 2) let us have a dinner together in Paris together on thursday before you go back to the us,&rdquo; the message read.</p>



<p>Trump did not include a reason for sharing the message, captioning the post only with &ldquo;Note from President Emmanuel Macron, of France.&rdquo; TIME has reached out to the White House and Macron&rsquo;s official residence, the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace, for comment. <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/macron-sent-message-to-trump-offering-to-host-g7-meeting-in-paris-thursday-entourage-f4a1cc9c"  target="_blank">AFP</a> reported that the French President&rsquo;s entourage confirmed the authenticity of the message.</p>



<p>Trump also <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115926107400617491"  target="_blank">shared</a> a message from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte after a phone call concerning Greenland assuring Trump that he is &ldquo;committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925766187001811"  target="_blank">said</a> in a post early Tuesday, adding that he would be meeting with &ldquo;various parties&rdquo; about Greenland in Davos. &ldquo;There can be no going back &mdash; On that, everyone agrees!&rdquo;</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/" >U.S.&rsquo;s military intervention in Venezuela</a> and capture of its leader Nicol&aacute;s Maduro at the start of the year, Trump has <a href="https://time.com/7344147/greenland-denmark-trump-takeover-independence-purchase-military-nato/" >ramped up his effort to wrest control of Greenland</a>, which is a part of the <a href="https://time.com/7347183/denmark-greenland-trump-europe/" >Kingdom of Denmark</a>. Both the E.U. and Greenland have <a href="https://time.com/7345949/greenland-denmark-trump/" >objected</a> to Trump&rsquo;s claims over the territory, and the dispute threatens to unravel the NATO defense alliance and upend the U.S.&rsquo;s relationship with its allies.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Trump <a href="https://time.com/7352424/republicans-denounce-trump-greenland-tariffs-threat-america-risk/" >threatened</a> to impose a 10% tariff on European allies from Feb. 1, which would increase to 25% in June, unless Denmark agrees to sell Greenland to the U.S. He also suggested that the use of force was <a href="https://time.com/7347751/trump-letter-norway-store-nobel-peace-prize-obligation-greenland-war/" >not off the table</a> in a letter sent to Norway&rsquo;s leader Jonas Gahr St&oslash;re.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,&rdquo; Trump said in the letter.</p>



<p>Trump has also sparred with Macron in recent days. While the E.U. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-19/eu-eyes-tariffs-on-93-billion-of-us-goods-over-new-trump-threat"  target="_blank">weighs</a> potential retaliatory tariffs of &euro;93 billion ($108 billion) on U.S. goods among other countermeasures, Macron has called Trump&rsquo;s tariff threat over Greenland &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-18/macron-to-seek-use-of-eu-anti-coercion-instrument-against-trump"  target="_blank">pushed</a> for the E.U. to use its anti-coercion instrument for the first time, which could restrict U.S. participation in the E.U. market. Trump also floated the possibility of imposing 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne after Macron declined to join Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;Board of Peace&rdquo; over concerns that the board&rsquo;s charter goes beyond the U.N. mandate allowing it to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza through 2027.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Nobody wants him because he&rsquo;s going to be out of office very soon,&rdquo; Trump told reporters on Monday after his invitation was rebuffed.</p>



<p>Among a number of overnight posts on his social media platform, Trump also shared two apparently AI-generated or edited images depicting a U.S. takeover of Greenland. One <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115925888562624963"  target="_blank">showed</a> a photo of him in the Oval Office talking to European leaders back in August with a fake map of Greenland overlaid with the U.S. flag in the background. (Canada and Venezuela were also overlaid with the U.S. flag.) The other <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115925897257210763"  target="_blank">showed</a> him, flanked by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance, planting the U.S. flag in Greenland soil.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2201636112.jpg" alt="UK Prime Minister Meets With President Trump In Washington"/>



<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly broken ranks with U.S. President Donald Trump over his renewed pressure campaign for the <a href="https://time.com/7344316/republicans-break-ranks-with-trump-over-greenland-annexation-threat/" >annexation of Greenland</a>. Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on the U.K. and other European allies until Denmark relents and sells the territory of Greenland&mdash;a move <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-remarks-on-greenland-19-january-2026"  target="_blank">Starmer has labeled &ldquo;completely wrong.&rdquo;</a></p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>During a press conference at Downing Street on Monday morning, Starmer argued the use of tariffs against allies &ldquo;is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland&rsquo;s security as a justification for economic pressure.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Referring to the matter as a &ldquo;very serious situation,&rdquo; Starmer&mdash;who rejected the idea of retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., for now at least&mdash;said a &ldquo;trade war is in no one&rsquo;s interest&rdquo; and emphasized that his priority is to act in the national interest of the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>&ldquo;On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies. Let&rsquo;s be clear, the security of Greenland matters and it will matter more as climate change reshapes the Arctic,&rdquo; said Starmer. &ldquo;As sea routes open and strategic competition intensifies, the High North will require greater attention, greater investment, and stronger collective defence.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The U.K. is ready to assist NATO allies on that front, Starmer vowed, before stating that no plan can be made without the involvement of Greenland and Denmark.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone. That right is fundamental, and we will support it,&rdquo; Starmer said, taking a clear stance against Trump&rsquo;s rhetoric, which includes the White House refusing to rule out taking Greenland by military force.</p>



<p>Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly denounced Trump&#8217;s attempts to annex the island. In his strongest pushback yet, Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen plainly stated last week &ldquo;if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Starmer&rsquo;s public rebuke of Trump&rsquo;s tariffs threat stands in stark contrast to the strong working relationship he has cultivated with the U.S. President over the past year. The two previously put on a united front for a &ldquo;groundbreaking&rdquo; <a href="https://time.com/7318214/trump-starmer-us-uk-tech-prosperity-deal-signed/" >billion-dollar U.K.-U.S. Tech Prosperity Deal</a> and were the first leaders to agree on a reciprocal <a href="https://time.com/7283842/united-states-united-kingdom-trade-deal-trump-starmer-tariffs-agreement/" >trade agreement amid Trump&rsquo;s initial &ldquo;Liberation Day&rdquo; tariffs push.</a> More recently, the <a href="https://time.com/7344656/united-kingdom-helped-united-states-trump-seize-oil-tankers/" >U.K. helped the U.S. seize</a> a Russian-flagged tanker in the North Atlantic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2236082748.jpg" alt="UK Hosts President Trump And First Lady Melania Trump For State Visit - Day Three" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Highlighting his wish for the strong alliance to continue, Starmer told reporters at Downing Street that the relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. &ldquo;matters profoundly, not just to our security, but to the prosperity and stability that people here depend upon.&rdquo; He said he&rsquo;s determined to keep that relationship &ldquo;strong, constructive, and focused on results.&rdquo;</p>



<p>However, although a calm approach to the matter is preferred, in a show of strength at home, Starmer, who shared his disapproval personally with Trump during a phone call on Sunday, emphasized that &ldquo;being pragmatic does not mean being passive.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump on Saturday <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115911344443637897"  target="_blank">said he would impose</a> a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and the United Kingdom beginning Feb. 1 &ldquo;on any and all goods sent to the United States of America.&rdquo; He said the tariff would be increased to 25% on June 1.</p>



<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte last week expressed the importance of &ldquo;the Arctic and Arctic security,&#8221; and several European NATO allies committed to sending military personnel to Greenland to strengthen that security amid heightened concerns over the territory. Trump appeared to reference this in his tariffs threat, citing that European nations &ldquo;have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eight countries threatened with the charges put on a united front over the weekend via a joint statement issued in response to Trump.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.government.se/statements/2026/01/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom/"  target="_blank">the statement read.</a></p>



<p>However, Starmer&rsquo;s approach to Trump&rsquo;s threat&mdash;and his disinterest in retaliatory tariffs&mdash;may well differ from that of the E.U. leaders who are set to discuss ways forward during an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2026/01/18/statement-by-president-costa-on-greenland/"  target="_blank">as arranged by president of the European Council</a> Ant&oacute;nio Costa.</p>



<p>On Monday, German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil and his French counterpart, Roland Lescure, weighed up various countermeasures at the disposal of the E.U., with Klingbeil asserting: &ldquo;We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read More</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/7346104/trump-greenland-annexation-threat-us-control/" >Trump Declares Anything Less Than U.S. Control of Greenland Is &lsquo;Unacceptable&rsquo;</a></em></p>



<p>European tariffs on imports from the United States, a package of  93 billion euros ($107.7 billion) which is currently suspended until early February, could be enforced. Another option comes in the form of the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which could restrict access to the single market in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc and block applications for E.U. contracts. Lescure noted that this avenue should serve as more of a deterrent, with deescalation seemingly remaining the ultimate shared goal among E.U. leadership.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256145614.jpg" alt="Greenland And Europe Hope To Avert U.S. Intervention To Acquire Greenland" alignment="original-size-image"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Trump, meanwhile, has refused to rule out leaving NATO over the Greenland tussle, and maintains that anything less than <a href="https://time.com/7346104/trump-greenland-annexation-threat-us-control/" >U.S. control of Greenland is &ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo;</a> According to the President, NATO &ldquo;should be leading the way for [the U.S.] to get it.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Greenland&#8217;s positioning between the U.S., Russia, and Europe makes it a strong geopolitical asset. Arguing that the U.S. acquiring Greenland is a &ldquo;national security&rdquo; matter, Trump has claimed that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect Greenland from Russian and Chinese interests. </p>



<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday declined to comment when asked about the perceived Russian threat against Greenland but, according to Reuters, he told reporters that Trump would go down in &ldquo;world history&rdquo; if the U.S. were to acquire the territory.<br><br></p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/donald-trump_71c177.jpg" alt="U.S. President Donald Trump stands in the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., on Jan. 16, 2026."/>



<p>Donald Trump has <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115901692370933354"  target="_blank">described</a> his proposed &ldquo;Board of Peace&rdquo;&mdash;the body that will oversee the transition and reconstruction of the war-wrought Gaza Strip&mdash;as &ldquo;the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place.&rdquo; But that prestige apparently comes with a hefty price tag.</p>



[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>Countries will have to cough up at least $1 billion in order to secure a permanent seat on the board, according to a draft charter, while other members will have three-year terms. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/trump-wants-nations-to-pay-1-billion-to-stay-on-his-peace-board"  target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> first reported on the high fee, and <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/full-text-charter-of-trumps-board-of-peace/"  target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>Times of Israel</em></a> posted a copy of the draft charter text.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter&rsquo;s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman. The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter&rsquo;s entry into force,&rdquo; the draft reportedly says.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how exactly the contribution will be used. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/18/trump-peace-board/"  target="_blank"><em>Washington Post</em></a> reported, citing an unnamed senior European official, that European leaders are in talks over Trump&rsquo;s ambitions for the board, which appear to be more expansive than just settling the Gaza conflict. The official also reportedly said that despite Europe&rsquo;s commitments to the Strip, there&rsquo;s little appetite to significantly fund an organization that advances a Trump-led world order, amid speculation that the Board of Peace is being devised as an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ee79faa-86d3-4c01-a180-add6e164ac28"  target="_blank">alternative to the United Nations</a>, which the U.S. under Trump has increasingly been hostile to.</p>



<p>Bloomberg added, citing unnamed sources, that most countries that could have joined the board have found it unacceptable that the draft appears to suggest Trump&mdash;who would be the board&rsquo;s inaugural chair&mdash;would manage its funds.</p>



<p>In dispelling claims about the fee, the White House&rsquo;s <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2012684845109874988"  target="_blank">rapid response account</a> on X said the fee &#8220;simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity.&#8221; An unnamed U.S. official also told Bloomberg that all money the board raises will be used to accomplish its mandate to rebuild Gaza.</p>



<p>Invitations to join Trump&rsquo;s board were sent out to several countries over the weekend, including <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-invited-to-sit-on-trumps-board-of-peace-for-gaza/article70523013.ece"  target="_blank">India</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ForeignMinistry/status/2012801567519330610?s=20"  target="_blank">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://www.iletisim.gov.tr/english/haberler/detay/head-of-communications-durans-statement-on-president-erdogans-invitation-to-un-board-of-peace"  target="_blank">T&uuml;rkiye</a>, and <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/trump-invites-sisi-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-egypt-fm-3fd68d57?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcV--1D_CbDF0mczAye928IFkWijOTpSX2-QyE5tox3RbrGOZbnC_2uOweoEmM%3D&amp;gaa_ts=696dae9b&amp;gaa_sig=HmMn1pMiDSKqACz0FvvxHUPSaRj0a3dOV5xY1lSd5jefy5g35AF6lkKy1_A6-J2xNzjZ8r69PS5x0-hilyvmuQ%3D%3D"  target="_blank">Egypt</a>. Some of them, particularly those allied with Trump, swiftly accepted the invite: <a href="https://x.com/JMilei/status/2012495664546992638"  target="_blank">Argentina</a> President Javier Milei said it was an &ldquo;honor&rdquo; to be invited as he posted Trump&rsquo;s invitation letter on social media, as did <a href="https://www.instagram.com/orbanviktor/p/DTpcGzRjfPx/?hl=en"  target="_blank">Hungary&rsquo;s Viktor Orb&aacute;n</a>.</p>



<p>Others, however, were more circumspect with the invitation. British paper <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-war/article/trump-gaza-peace-board-members-lc5zv5fsp?utm_source=chatgpt.com"  target="_blank"><em>The Times of London</em></a> reported that U.K. ministers are concerned about where funds would go and what legal framework the board is using to operate. Canada&rsquo;s Prime Minister Mark Carney <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trump-gaza-board-of-peace-carney-palestine-israel-hamas/"  target="_blank">told reporters Sunday</a> that Trump had approached him about the board weeks back but said that &ldquo;with respect to the specifics of the &lsquo;Board of Peace&rsquo;, we haven&rsquo;t gone through all the details of the structure, how it&rsquo;s going to work, what financing is for, etc. &hellip; And so we will work through those in the coming days.&rdquo;</p>



<p>On Friday, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2026/01/statement-on-president-trumps-comprehensive-plan-to-end-the-gaza-conflict/"  target="_blank">announced</a> the board&rsquo;s founding members, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy for peace missions Steve Witkoff, Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, and World Bank Group president Ajay Banga. A spokesperson for Blair <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-18/blair-distances-himself-from-trump-s-1-billion-peace-board-fee"  target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a> that he wasn&rsquo;t involved in determining board membership and that questions about the high fee should be directed to the Trump Administration.</p>



<p>The Trump Administration <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1972726021196562494"  target="_blank">has also said</a> that the board &#8220;will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza,&rdquo; but a review of the draft charter text makes no explicit mention of Gaza. The draft charter describes the board as &ldquo;an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The U.N. Security Council in November <a href="https://docs.un.org/en/s/res/2803(2025)"  target="_blank">adopted a resolution</a> backing Trump&rsquo;s proposed board to set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza&rsquo;s redevelopment, though it only authorized the board&rsquo;s mandate until 2027.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s plans for the Board of Peace also come as he has threatened to <a href="https://time.com/7344877/trump-greenland-annexation-threats-purchase-national-security-economic/" >take over Greenland</a>, <a href="https://time.com/7347751/trump-letter-norway-store-nobel-peace-prize-obligation-greenland-war/" >warning late Sunday in a reported letter to Norway</a>&mdash;one of several countries the U.S. <a href="https://time.com/7347149/greenland-tariffs/" >sanctioned with tariffs</a> over a show of support to Greenland&mdash;that after <a href="https://time.com/7324832/trump-loses-nobel-peace-prize-maria-corina-machado/" >not receiving last year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize</a>, he &ldquo;no longer feel[s] an obligation to think purely of Peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donald Trump sent an ominous warning to the Prime Minister of Norway, suggesting that war could be on the table in his <a href="https://time.com/7344877/trump-greenland-annexation-threats-purchase-national-security-economic/" >pursuit of Greenland</a>, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of <a href="https://time.com/7347183/denmark-greenland-trump-europe/" >Denmark</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/nickschifrin/status/2013107018081489006"  target="_blank">letter shared late Sunday by PBS journalist Nick Schifrin</a> from the U.S. President to Norway&rsquo;s leader Jonas Gahr St&oslash;re, Trump warned that after not winning last year&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7324832/trump-loses-nobel-peace-prize-maria-corina-machado/" >Nobel Peace Prize</a> &ldquo;for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS,&rdquo; he &ldquo;no longer feel[s] an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.&rdquo; </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Trump has in the past <a href="https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/34476"  target="_blank">conflated the honor</a>, which is given by the Norway-based Nobel Committee, with the nation and its government. Of his denial of the Peace Prize, Trump told Fox News&rsquo; Sean Hannity earlier this month: &ldquo;It&#8217;s been a very big embarrassment to the country of Norway. Whether they have anything to do with it or not. I think they do. They say they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s letter to St&oslash;re went on to tie his warning of no longer thinking &ldquo;purely of peace&rdquo; to his campaign to take over Greenland.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a &lsquo;right of ownership&rsquo; anyway?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;There are no written documents, it&rsquo;s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The National Security Council also reportedly forwarded the letter to European ambassadors in Washington, according to Schifrin&rsquo;s X post.</p>



<p>St&oslash;re confirmed to <a href="https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/q6AdB0/trump-i-melding-til-stoere-foeler-ikke-lenger-noen-forpliktelse"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Norwegian news outlet VG</a> that he received the letter, saying that Trump&rsquo;s note was a response to an earlier message where he and Finland&#8217;s President Alexander Stubb sought a conversation with their U.S. counterpart.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The President is committed to establishing long-term peace at home and abroad,&rdquo; White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to TIME, when asked about the letter. &ldquo;President Trump believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security, and he is confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s message to St&oslash;re comes as he escalated pressure on fellow member-states in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defense alliance to deliver Greenland to him. On Saturday, Trump announced on Truth Social that starting Feb. 1, he&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7347120/greenland-trump-protests-tariffs/" >imposing a 10% tariff</a> on a handful of NATO members, including Norway and Denmark, for <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" >sending troops to Greenland</a>. That tariff will remain&mdash;and even increase to 25% come June&mdash;&ldquo;until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/7347149/greenland-tariffs/" ><em>Europe Promises United Response to Trump&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dangerous&rsquo; Greenland Tariffs</em></a></p>



<p>NATO countries have fiercely opposed Trump&rsquo;s plan to occupy Greenland, and have criticized the U.S. President&rsquo;s attempts to pressure its allies with tariffs, which leaders from <a href="https://ga.de/vizekanzler-wir-duerfen-uns-nicht-erpressen-lassen_aid-142489597"  target="_blank">Germany</a>, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/dutch-minister-calls-trumps-greenland-tariff-threat-blackmail-2026-01-18/"  target="_blank">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/SwedishPM/status/2012589849585344518"  target="_blank">Sweden</a> have described as &ldquo;blackmail,&rdquo; to hand over the Danish territory.</p>



<p>Following the threat, European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-18/macron-to-seek-use-of-eu-anti-coercion-instrument-against-trump"  target="_blank">reportedly</a> considered using the European Union&rsquo;s anti-coercion instrument&mdash;the bloc&rsquo;s retaliatory trade tool nicknamed the trade &ldquo;bazooka&rdquo; for how it could upend trans-Atlantic trade. The &ldquo;bazooka&rdquo; has never been used before on any country, but should the E.U. choose to, it could severely limit U.S. access to E.U. trade markets, through either tariffs or other import control measures.</p>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7346324/greenland-trump-polls-annexation-denmark/" >Most Americans</a> and <a href="https://time.com/7344316/republicans-break-ranks-with-trump-over-greenland-annexation-threat/" >even some Republicans</a> are not in support of Trump&rsquo;s plan to take Greenland, especially <a href="https://time.com/7344147/greenland-denmark-trump-takeover-independence-purchase-military-nato/" >if it involves force</a>.</p>

<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7347183"></div></div>
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/7347183/denmark-greenland-trump-europe/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256362023.jpg" alt="GREENLAND-DENMARK-US-DEFENCE-NATO"/>



<p>President Donald Trump has often joked that Denmark&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7346104/trump-greenland-annexation-threat-us-control/" >defense of Greenland</a> is so paltry that it consists entirely of &ldquo;two dog sleds.&rdquo; As one of the few people to have manned those sleds, Kasper Dams&oslash; bristles at the remark.  </p>



<p>For two years in the late 1990s, the Danish elite special forces soldier patrolled the vast, frozen expanses of Greenland&rsquo;s uninhabited northeastern corner, often with only eleven dogs and one fellow soldier for company. His Sirius Patrol unit underwent the kind of hardcore physical training Navy SEALs receive, endured mental resilience training from NASA, and spent long months in minus-50-degree temperatures monitoring for any suspicious activity. So, although he acknowledges that Denmark needs to <a href="https://time.com/7347120/greenland-trump-protests-tariffs/" >increase its security investment</a> in Greenland, Dams&oslash; says the patrols are no joke. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;He can make fun of the dog sleds all he wants. But he should come and see what we do. Because then, no one will be laughing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Dams&oslash;&rsquo;s words suggest a bit of steel beneath the Danes&rsquo; normally agreeable exterior, it is a sentiment increasingly shared at the highest levels of government. As President Trump&rsquo;s long-standing desire to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark, has erupted into a full-blown crisis, the Danish government has been working fervently to prove itself a good ally and reach a diplomatic solution. But as Trump has continued to insist that Greenland must be taken, Denmark is also beginning to communicate, ever so delicately, that there are limits to its flexibility. And now that Trump has responded with further threats to its efforts to give him more of the Arctic security he says he wants, the pushback is spreading throughout Europe.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We have to work closer with our most reliable allies,&rdquo; said Rasmus Jarlov, chairman of the Danish parliament&rsquo;s defense committee, in an interview with TIME on Friday.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the ones that threaten us and alienate us, we will work a bit less with in the future. Maybe a lot less, depending on how this develops.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Although he initially expressed his desire to acquire Greenland for the United States during his first term, President Trump&rsquo;s Jan. 9 comments that he would take the island, which has a population of 57,000, &ldquo;the easy way&rdquo; or &ldquo;the hard way,&rdquo; came as a profound shock to both Danes and Greenlanders. The surprise stemmed not only from the belligerence of a message directed toward one of the U.S.&rsquo;s oldest and closest allies, but for its superfluousness.&nbsp; Greenland&rsquo;s leaders have made it clear they would welcome U.S. business investment, while Denmark already has treaties in place that allow the U.S. to expand its military presence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m still trying to grasp what it is the president really wants,&rdquo; said Stig &Oslash;stergaard Nielsen, a former commander of Denmark&rsquo;s Arctic Command, who is today a senior military advisor with the Copenhagen-based consultancy Rud Pedersen. &ldquo;The President has been told again and again that the treaties and agreements we already have with the United States allow them to have all the services and bases they can think of.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The Danish foreign minister, Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen, and his Greenlandic counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, sought to reinforce that point when they traveled to Washington this week to meet with Vice-President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Although they left the meeting satisfied that both sides had agreed to a series of working meetings to negotiate options for greater security in the region while respecting what Rasmussen called the &ldquo;red lines&rdquo; of Denmark&rsquo;s sovereignty and Greenland&rsquo;s self-determination, the White House instead said that the meetings would deal with the U.S.&ldquo;acquisition of Greenland.&rdquo; &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; Rasmussen muttered to the press, &#8220;it&rsquo;s going to be a short series.&rdquo;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256745286.jpg" alt="Protest In Copenhagen Against US Threats To Annex Greenland" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>At the same time, Denmark has been busily bolstering its military presence in Greenland. A year ago, the government allocated $13.7 billion for investment in Arctic security, commissioning more drones, radar systems, and icebreaker ships, as well as an additional $37 million to increase the capacities of the Sirius Patrol, who, with their dogsleds, monitor otherwise inaccessible land. And this week, it sent more troops to Greenland, whose purpose, according to Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen, was &ldquo;to establish a more permanent military presence with a larger Danish contribution.&rdquo; </p>



<p>They&rsquo;re not doing it alone. Although previous Danish attempts to convince NATO to focus on the Arctic with initiatives like it those it is currently running in the Baltics have failed, this time many of its European allies, including France, Sweden, the UK, Norway, and the Netherlands, sent small numbers of troops to join an exercise intended to investigate the logistical and tactical needs for a more permanent presence. </p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" ><em>Denmark Beefs Up Military Presence in Greenland </em></a></p>



<p>Yet, however eager the demonstrations of Denmark&rsquo;s contribution and NATO&rsquo;s collective goodwill may be, a more cold-eyed rationale may lie beneath their surface. &ldquo;The overt message is, let&#8217;s stand together. Let&#8217;s invest in NATO to protect this NATO territory,&rdquo; says Sten Rynning, professor of war studies at the University of Southern Denmark. &ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s a hidden message, which is that the Allies will not accept violations of sovereignty within the alliance.&rdquo; The joint participation, he argues, raises the political costs to the U.S. of intervention. &ldquo;It says to the Trump administration: &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re considering a military operation, you will have to handcuff soldiers from a lot of your allies&rsquo; countries, and take them away.&rsquo; It&#8217;s not about deterrence, it&#8217;s about complicating the calculations.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned bluntly that a U.S. military invasion would be the end of NATO. And on the diplomatic front, that threat seems to be Denmark&rsquo;s strongest card, as it works to persuade Republicans, including the two who joined a bipartisan congressional delegation to Copenhagen this week, to take action against the President&rsquo;s designs on the island. </p>



<p>Kay Bailey Hutchison, the former Republican senator from Texas who was ambassador to NATO during the first Trump administration, believes that ultimately, diplomacy will prevail.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any malign influence is going to affect both North America and Europe,&rdquo; Hutchison said. &ldquo;Which is really what NATO was built to deter. So I think that with America&rsquo;s lead in NATO, the way forward is to work with Denmark and our NATO allies to secure Greenland, and that negotiation is going to be the way out.&rdquo;</p>



<p>As tensions mount, others are no longer so sure that negotiation alone is enough. Earlier in the week, Thomas Crosbie, professor of military operations at the Danish Defense Academy, warned that it was unclear how the White House would interpret those military exercises in Greenland.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bit of a paradox in that sending more troops could be seen as simply responsive to their [the Americans&rsquo;] requests. Or it could be seen as escalatory, depending on how it&rsquo;s framed.&rdquo;</p>



<p>On Saturday, the world seemingly got its answer when President Trump announced<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115911344443637897"  target="_blank"> on Truth Social</a> that he would impose a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark and the seven countries supporting them on Greenland until &ldquo;a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European parliament, which had been set to approve the tariff deal it had negotiated with the Trump administration on Wednesday, put the plan on indefinite hold.&#8221;I see no possibility for the European Parliament to give the green light to move forward with the tariff agreement, Karin Karlsboro, Swedish member of the&nbsp; European Parliament and trade coordinator for the Renew coalition, told Politico. &ldquo;Instead, the EU must prepare to respond to President Trump&rsquo;s tariff attacks, including those targeting Sweden.&rdquo;</p>



<p>And just as European officials have been whispering&mdash;and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/hit-back-donald-trump-europe-mulls-unthinkable-options-greenland-threats-ramp-up-tensions/"  target="_blank">sometimes shouting</a>&mdash;about whether it may be necessary to fight back with the so-called &lsquo;bazooka&rsquo; of its Anti-Coercion Instrument, so too are the continent&rsquo;s security advisors quietly beginning to weigh more extreme options. &ldquo;Could it be losing access to intelligence, to bases, to overflight corridors? I have only heard rumors, so it&#8217;s hard to say,&rdquo; said Rynning. &ldquo;My sense is that Europeans are at the point where they&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s one thing for you to push us around and question how much we spend, or if we&rsquo;re dressed improperly, or not living up to your manly standard. It&#8217;s quite another thing to violate our sovereignty. And so, there&#8217;s a sense that a red line has come into play.&rdquo; </p>



<p>For former Sirius patroller Dams&oslash;, who also fought in Afghanistan alongside U.S. troops, the escalating situation is causing some cognitive dissonance.&nbsp; Although he sees the current joint exercise as &ldquo;another coalition of the friendly,&rdquo; he regrets that the American-led alliance that has been central in his own military career now hangs in the balance. &ldquo;We all joined wars together, whether it was Iraq, or Afghanistan,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was always together with our allies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At least 5,000 people were killed in the protests that gripped <a href="https://time.com/7345555/iran-protests-deaths-us-trump-israel/" >Iran this month</a>, according to an Iranian official, 500 of whom were security personnel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The toll is the highest yet cited by a government source for the nationwide protests that shook Iran&rsquo;s establishment and brought the United States to the brink of intervention.&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>The Iranian official, who was quoted by Reuters, blamed &#8220;Israel and armed groups abroad&#8221; for the high number of people killed, and said the government&rsquo;s official count was unlikely to go much higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protests erupted in Tehran after the rial, Iran&rsquo;s currency, crashed on December 28. The demonstrations quickly snowballed into a broader <a href="https://time.com/7345623/iran-protests-reza-shah-pahlavi-ayatollah-1979/" >anti-government movement</a> calling for the fall of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  </p>



<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/7346661/trump-iran-military-strikes-diplomacy-sanctions/" ><em>For Trump, a Path Forward on Iran That Goes Beyond Bombs</em></a></p>



<p>The crackdown began with an internet blackout on Jan. 8, plunging the country into an information darkness and preventing humanitarian groups and governments alike from understanding the full extent of the killing.</p>



<p>According to human rights groups, protesters were killed by security forces en masse. Throughout the blackout, IHR estimates that more than 20,000 people have been arrested in connection with the protests.</p>



<p>That blackout has made an accurate death toll difficult to ascertain, as humanitarian groups struggle to reach contacts on the ground. But as early as last week, an informal group of academics and professionals working at hospitals and <a href="https://time.com/7345347/iran-protests-death-toll-estimate-thousands/" >contacted by TIME</a> said protester deaths between Jan. 8 and Jan. 10 alone could have reached 6,000. </p>



<p>In a video address Saturday, Khamenei said &ldquo;thousands&rdquo; had died in the protests, &ldquo;some in an inhuman, savage manner.&rdquo; He blamed the United States and President Donald Trump for the extent of destruction, calling him a &ldquo;criminal&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will not drag the country into war, but we will not let domestic or international criminals go unpunished,&#8221; Khamenei said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump has hinted in recent days that he came close to authorizing military strikes against Iran over the crackdown. He spent days last week threatening Iran&rsquo;s leaders if the crackdown continued, and on Jan. 13 <a href="https://time.com/7345860/trump-iran-military-strikes/" >declared</a>, &ldquo;help is on its way.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He was reportedly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/18/iran-strikes-trump-delay-military-options"  target="_blank">presented with</a> military options to strike Iran on Tuesday, but by Friday, he appeared to have decided against the move after claiming that Iran had canceled some 800 executions of protesters it had planned.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The best decision he ever made was not hanging more than 800 people two days ago,&rdquo; Trump told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528"  target="_blank">POLITICO</a> about Iran&#8217;s Supreme Leader on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in that same interview, Trump reacted with anger over Khamenei&rsquo;s remarks that blamed Trump for the high death toll in Iran.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to look for new leadership in Iran,&rdquo; he declared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump said Khamenei &ldquo;should focus on running his country properly, like I do with the United States, and not killing people by the thousands in order to keep control.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It is unclear whether Trump is still considering military action against Iran. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Several <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-sending-military-assets-middle-east-trump-weighs-iran-strike-sources-say"  target="_blank" target="_blank">news outlets</a> reported on Friday that the aircraft carrier US</span>S Abraham Lincoln was heading towards the Middle East and would arrive in approximately one week. </p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26017638341199.jpg" alt="Greenland US Protest"/>



<p>Europe vowed a united response after President Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on eight of its allies for sending troops to Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that the president has repeatedly <a href="https://time.com/7347049/greenland-trump-annexation-threats-world-leaders/" >threatened to annex</a>.</p>



[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]

<p>Trump said Saturday he would introduce 10% tariffs on imports from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, all of which sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland in recent days to <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" >take part in military exercises</a>.</p>



<p>The move, which comes as Trump has stepped up his campaign to annex the territory, prompted a wave of condemnation from the leaders of the ostensible U.S. allies, which were already subject to tariffs of 10% and 15%. The row could call into question trade deals the U.S. struck with the U.K. in May and the European Union in July.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7345949/greenland-denmark-trump/" ><em>On Eve of Crunch Talks with U.S., Greenland Declares: &lsquo;We Choose Denmark&rsquo;</em></a></p>



<p>On Sunday, the eight countries issued a joint statement declaring that they &ldquo;stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;As members of Nato, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise Arctic Endurance conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone,&rdquo; the statement said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty,&#8221; it added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A day earlier, Trump&rsquo;s announcement set off a firestorm across European capitals as he threatened tariffs in his latest effort to acquire the territory of Greenland for the United States. </p>



<p>&ldquo;Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Finland have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown. This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet,&rdquo; Trump said in a Truth Social <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115911344443637897"  target="_blank">post Saturday</a> announcing the tariffs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trump added that the tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1, and would remain in effect &ldquo;until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.&rdquo;</p>



<p>His comments came as thousands rallied on Saturday in the Danish cities of Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense, as well as in Greenland&rsquo;s capital, Nuuk, to oppose Trump&rsquo;s annexation plans. In Nuuk, hundreds marched to the U.S. consulate, some <a href="https://x.com/carlbildt/status/2012574191241818589"  target="_blank">holding signs</a> that read &ldquo;Greenland is not for sale,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yankees go home!&rdquo;</p>



<p>The tariff announcement drew unusually blunt reactions from the leaders of some of America&#8217;s closest allies on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,&#8221; British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, adding that he would raise the issue directly with the White House.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our position on Greenland is very clear&mdash;it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called the tariffs &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No intimidation nor threat will influence us, neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s threat is likely to prompt a reciprocal response from Europe. The European Union summoned ambassadors to an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday, and Reuters reported the bloc could suspend its work on a U.S. trade deal it struck in July. </p>



<p>European Council President Antonio Costa said <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-vows-response-to-new-trump-tariffs-over-greenland/"  target="_blank">Saturday</a> he was &#8220;coordinating a joint response from the European Union&#8217;s member states on this issue.&#8221; </p>



<p>Speaking on Sunday, German finance minister and vice chancellor Lars Klingbeil said: &#8220;And so the very clear signal: we will not be blackmailed, and there will be a European response.&#8221;</p>



<p>Trump has argued that anything less than total U.S. control of Greenland would be &ldquo;unacceptable, &rdquo; and has said that annexing the territory is necessary for &ldquo;national security.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>European nations, meanwhile, have strongly opposed the U.S. takeover of Greenland. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, Denmark increased its military presence on the island and conducted joint military exercises with the European allies targeted by Trump&rsquo;s tariffs.</p>



<p>Denmark&rsquo;s foreign minister, Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen, told reporters during a visit to Washington this week that Denmark was reinforcing security in the Arctic &ldquo;by committing additional funds for military capabilities&mdash;not dogsleds, but ships, drones, fighter jets, etc,&rdquo; referring to an often-repeated jibe by Trump that Denmark&rsquo;s military presence on the island consisted entirely of dogsleds.</p>



<p>Several European NATO allies announced they were also sending military personnel to the island after Danish representatives emerged from meetings at the White House, declaring they had &#8220;fundamental disagreements&#8221; with the Trump administration over who should control Greenland.</p>



<p>Announcing France&rsquo;s involvement in the military exercises in Greenland, Macron took aim at Trump&rsquo;s ambitions.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We live in a world where destabilizing powers have awakened,&rdquo; Macron said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are seeing certainties that sometimes lasted for decades being called into question, and Europe is being shaken in some of its certainties,&rdquo; he said. Europe &ldquo;sometimes has allies that we thought were predictable, always by our side, who are now causing us to have serious doubts, or even turning on those who doubted the least.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Norway have also sent troops to take part in the military exercise, Operation Arctic Endurance.</p>



<p>Greenland&rsquo;s leaders and people have been clear in their opposition to the possibility of the U.S. taking control of the territory. Greenland&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said this week that the island would <a href="https://time.com/7345949/greenland-denmark-trump/" >choose Denmark</a> over the U.S. if it had to choose, while polls show that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose the idea of becoming part of the U.S.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy,&rdquo; Nielsen said earlier this month. &ldquo;This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump has frequently used tariffs as a <a href="https://time.com/7305626/chaotic-world-of-trumps-tariffs/" >foreign policy tool</a> during his second term, negotiating deals with India, China, and the U.K. to lower tariffs in exchange for concessions on his policy priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>President Donald Trump called for &ldquo;new leadership&rdquo; in Iran after reading a series of social media posts from the country&rsquo;s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, on Saturday, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528?"  target="_blank">POLITICO</a> reported.</p>



<p>The remarks represent the latest in a series of <a href="https://time.com/7345860/trump-iran-military-strikes/" >sharp shifts in tone</a> from the president with regard to Iran&rsquo;s leadership in the last week, as he has weighed military intervention in response to a crackdown that has killed thousands of protesters. </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Trump&#8217;s comments came during an interview with POLITICO in which he was read a series of <a href="https://x.com/khamenei_ir/status/2012468046225424434?s=20"  target="_blank">posts</a> from Khamenei on X on Saturday that blamed Trump for the deaths of protesters in Iran.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to look for new leadership in Iran,&rdquo; Trump said in response.</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7345555/iran-protests-deaths-us-trump-israel/" ><em>What&rsquo;s Happening in Iran Right Now, Explained</em></a></p>



<p>&ldquo;What he is guilty of, as the leader of a country, is the complete destruction of the country and the use of violence at levels never seen before,&rdquo; Trump continued. &ldquo;In order to keep the country functioning &mdash; even though that function is a very low level &mdash; the leadership should focus on running his country properly, like I do with the United States, and not killing people by the thousands in order to keep control.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In a series of missives posted on Saturday, Khamenei blamed Trump for the violence in Iran and said the U.S. &ldquo;must be held accountable.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We find the US President guilty due to the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted upon the Iranian nation,&rdquo; <a href="https://x.com/khamenei_ir/status/2012468046225424434?s=20"  target="_blank">Khamenei wrote</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The US had made extensive preparations to orchestrate this sedition. This sedition was a prelude to even bigger schemes. The Iranian nation defeated the US,&rdquo; he wrote in another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not clear who read the posts to Trump, but the president&rsquo;s reaction is a sign of the fragility of the current peace between the U.S. and Iran. Trump said he had been presented with a number of &ldquo;very strong options&rdquo; to strike Iran last week after the death toll from the crackdown on protests reached the hundreds.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, as the death toll crept higher into the thousands, it appeared Trump was on the brink of authorizing strikes when he told protesters that &ldquo;help was on its way.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#8220;Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING &#8211; TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!&#8221; Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. &#8220;Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.&#8221;</p>



<p>By Friday, however, Trump&rsquo;s tone suddenly changed when he thanked Iran&#8217;s leaders for apparently cancelling 800 executions, without providing evidence.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115906000981082082"  target="_blank">posted Friday</a> on Truth Social.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, said it had verified 3,090 deaths in Iran, including 2,885 protesters, and over 22,000 arrests.</p>



<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment. <br></p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256615736.jpg" alt="Greenland And Europe Hope To Avert U.S. Intervention To Aquire Greenland"/>



<p>President Donald Trump said he would introduce 10% tariffs on imports from several European allies for sending troops to take part in military exercises in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that he has <a href="https://time.com/7347049/greenland-trump-annexation-threats-world-leaders/" >repeatedly threatened to annex</a>.  </p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Finland have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown. This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet,&rdquo; Trump said in a Truth Social <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115911344443637897"  target="_blank">post Saturday</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Starting on February 1st, 2026, all of the above mentioned Countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Finland), will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America,&rdquo; he added</p>

<p>Trump added that the tariff would increase to 25% on June 1, and would remain in effect &ldquo;until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.&rdquo;</p>



<p>His comments came as thousands rallied on Saturday in the Danish cities of Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense, as well as in Greenland&rsquo;s capital, Nuuk, to oppose Trump&rsquo;s annexation plans. In Nuuk, hundreds marched to the U.S. consulate, <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">some <a href="https://x.com/carlbildt/status/2012574191241818589"  target="_blank" target="_blank">holding signs</a> that read</span> &ldquo;Greenland is not for sale.&rdquo; </p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256745286.jpg" alt="Protest In Copenhagen Against US Threats To Annex Greenland" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The tariff announcement drew unusually blunt reactions from the leaders of some of America&#8217;s closest allies.</p>



<p>&#8220;Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,&#8221; British Prime Minister Starmer said, adding that he would raise the issue directly with the White House.  </p>



<p>&#8220;Our position on Greenland is very clear&mdash;it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>French President Emmanuel Macron called the tariffs &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;No intimidation nor threat will influence us, neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Trump has argued that anything less than total U.S. control of Greenland would be &ldquo;unacceptable, &rdquo; and has said that annexing the territory is necessary for &ldquo;national security.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>European nations, meanwhile, have expressed fierce opposition to the U.S. takeover of Greenland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Denmark increased its military presence on the island and conducted joint military exercises with the European allies targeted by Trump&rsquo;s tariffs. </p>



<p>Denmark&rsquo;s foreign minister, Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen, told reporters during a visit to Washington this week that Denmark was reinforcing security in the Arctic &ldquo;by committing additional funds for military capabilities&mdash;not dogsleds, but ships, drones, fighter jets, etc,&rdquo; referring to an often-repeated jibe by Trump that Denmark&rsquo;s military presence on the island consisted entirely of dogsleds. </p>

<p>Several European NATO allies announced they were also sending military personnel to the island after Danish representatives emerged from meetings at the White House, declaring they had &#8220;fundamental disagreements&#8221; with the Trump administration over who should control Greenland.</p>



<p>Announcing France&rsquo;s involvement in the military exercises in Greenland, Macron took aim at Trump&rsquo;s ambitions.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We live in a world where destabilizing powers have awakened,&rdquo; Macron said.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are seeing certainties that sometimes lasted for decades being called into question, and Europe is being shaken in some of its certainties,&rdquo; he said. Europe &ldquo;sometimes has allies that we thought were predictable, always by our side, who are now causing us to have serious doubts, or even turning on those who doubted the least.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Norway have also sent troops to take part in the military exercise, Operation Arctic Endurance.  </p>



<p>Greenland&rsquo;s leaders and people have been clear in their opposition to the possibility of the U.S. taking control of the territory. Greenland&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said this week that the island would <a href="https://time.com/7345949/greenland-denmark-trump/" >choose Denmark</a> over the U.S. if it had to choose, while polls show that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose the idea of becoming part of the U.S.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy,&rdquo; Nielsen said earlier this month. &ldquo;This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump has frequently used tariffs as a <a href="https://time.com/7305626/chaotic-world-of-trumps-tariffs/" >foreign policy tool</a> during his second term, negotiating deals with India, China, and the U.K. to lower tariffs in exchange for concessions on his policy priorities.&nbsp;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255957509.jpg" alt="Unrest In Iran As Protesters Demonstrate Over Economic Crisis"/>



<p>When President Donald Trump told protesters in Iran that &ldquo;<a href="https://time.com/7345860/trump-iran-military-strikes/" >help is on its way</a>,&rdquo; they took heart. Their hopes rose further on Wednesday, with news that the Pentagon had ordered some non-essential personnel from its largest Middle East air base, a move seen as preparation for battle. But on Thursday, when Trump reversed course, announcing that Iran&rsquo;s regime had agreed to stop killing its people in the streets, protestors felt betrayed, they told TIME.<br><br>&ldquo;He&#8217;s not only yellow on the outside, he&#8217;s also yellow inside,&rdquo; said an arts teacher in Tehran.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;After he said the Iranian authorities had told him there won&rsquo;t be any more killings and executions, everyone was just stunned,&rdquo; said an Iranian <a href="https://time.com/7346661/trump-iran-military-strikes-diplomacy-sanctions/" >interviewed Friday</a>, after traveling out of the country. &ldquo;Everyone was enraged; they just kept saying this bastard used us as cannon fodder. Iranians feel that they were played, that he fooled them, deceived them.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7345555/iran-protests-deaths-us-trump-israel/" ><em>What&rsquo;s Happening in Iran Right Now, Explained</em></a></p>



<p>&ldquo;Trump is worse than Obama,&rdquo; said a 40-year-old businessman in Tehran, who said he called friends and relatives to give them the good news after Trump&rsquo;s&nbsp; &ldquo;help is on its way&rdquo; post.&nbsp; &ldquo;He screwed up. He pulled the rug from under our feet.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The interviews were conducted after Trump appeared to back down from carrying out long-threatened military action against Iran this week. But the President added to the uncertainty again on Saturday by calling for an end to the rule of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to look for new leadership in Iran,&rdquo; he told POLITICO, after reportedly reading a series of posts from the Iranian leader blaming Trump for the deaths of protesters. &ldquo;The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people,&rdquo; he added. </p>



<p>His comments may not be enough to bring protesters back out onto the streets, however. Trump, who ordered the U.S. military to join Israel in attacking Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program in June, had urged on the latest protests nearly from the start. The demonstrations began in Tehran&rsquo;s Grand Bazaar on Dec. 28, in response to the abrupt, catastrophic devaluation of Iran&rsquo;s currency, then grew steadily across the country. In the past&mdash;2009, 2017, 2019, and 2022&mdash;Iran&rsquo;s authoritarian regime had crushed mass protests. But five days into this outbreak,  on Jan. 2, Trump made an explicit promise on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186"  target="_blank">Truth Social</a>: &ldquo;If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protestors, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.&rdquo; </p>



<p>Iranians took heart. On Jan. 8, at the start of the Iranian weekend and following calls by Iran&rsquo;s exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi and other opposition groups, millions took to the streets across the country.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;Trump is responsible&#8217;</h2>



<p>The regime, in turn, responded with extreme violence. First, as it has done in the past before directing live fire into groups of its own citizens, it disconnected the nation of 90 million from the internet, then cut cell phone, SMS and land lines. Security forces then mounted an onslaught that left &ldquo;thousands dead&rdquo;, according to Khamenei, in remarks carried by the state TV Saturday.<br><br>&ldquo;When I saw the man a few metres ahead of me fall backwards, I didn&rsquo;t understand what had happened,&rdquo; said the businessman, describing a scene on Jan. 8 on a Tehran street. &ldquo;When we gathered around him, all I could see in the dark night was a red spot on his forehead. It was only when the blood from the back of his head pooled at our feet that we realized he&rsquo;d been shot by a sniper.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While the Iranian regime ordered the attacks, &ldquo;Trump is also responsible for the death of these 15,000,&rdquo; he said, quoting one estimate of the dead. &ldquo;Because many of the protesters took to the streets when they saw his post that the US is locked and loaded.&rdquo; He said that the U.S. must have made a deal with the Islamic Republic &ldquo;to betray Iranians like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>The killings occurred across the country. In the northern city of Zirab, a 39-year-old man said that, on the next day, Jan. 9, protestors were forced down a street only to see the way ahead blocked, with security forces at their back. &ldquo;Then the streetlights went out, and machine guns started shooting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing could be seen, everyone was falling down, either from bullets or not seeing ahead of them, trying to get away.&rdquo; The resident said he doesn&rsquo;t know how many were killed, but that in the next few days there were as many as 17 missing in the city of a few thousand.<br><br>Iran&rsquo;s rulers publicly gloated over Trump&rsquo;s reversal. On Friday, Trump thanked them for promising to stop the planned executions of 800 protestors, the assurance he had offered as grounds for withholding the military action so widely expected that international flights steered around Iranian airspace.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254948920_cb59eb.jpg" alt="Protests in Iran January 2026" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>&#8220;Trump says a lot of nonsense and gibberish,&rdquo; Tehran&rsquo;s prosecutor, Ali Salehi, replied on Saturday, according to state TV. &ldquo;Our reaction will be forceful, preventive and swift. Indictments have been issued for numerous cases and sent to courts.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iranians say they are already living with the consequences of Trump&rsquo;s reversal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already martial law,&rdquo; said a woman in Tehran. &ldquo;Now, after Trump went back on his word, they&rsquo;ve become even more brazen. I saw a checkpoint on Marzdaran Boulevard where they were checking the cellphones of people.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost all hope,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s not going to do anything. Why should he? He doesn&rsquo;t care about us.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8216;He is tricking the regime&#8217; </h2>



<p>Others say they retain hope that Trump still might act. &ldquo;My husband believes that this is Trump&rsquo;s usual pattern, to confuse them [the Islamic Republic],&rdquo; said the Tehran resident. &ldquo;He says if Trump does not attack, how can the regime be toppled? Iranians are doing everything they can, but the regime is just too savage.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;He is tricking the regime,&rdquo; said an engineer in Tehran, who also sees Trump&rsquo;s reversal as tactical. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll attack, and attack hard. He&rsquo;s going to go after Zahhak himself,&rdquo; the engineer said, referring to the name of the most evil character in Iranian mythology, used by protestors to describe Khamenei. &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any other option,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&#8217;s different this time.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The businessman also hopes that this uprising will be different, so much so that he stayed behind in Iran when his wife and child flew out of the country on Thursday. But he says the protesters would need help. &ldquo;The people on the streets did all they could do. We were facing machine guns on pick-up trucks, empty-handed. The only way we can win is with foreign intervention, like Kosovo or Bosnia.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whatever Trump ultimately decides to do, most people in Iran agree that the protests have gone underground.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Right now the uprising is paralyzed,&rdquo; said the man from Zirab, who put the blame on Trump as well as the brutality of the regime. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it will ever recover.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/World-Leaders-Respond-Greenland.jpg" alt="Greenland's Prime Minister At New Year's Reception In Copenhagen"/>



<p>As President Donald Trump has renewed <a href="https://time.com/7344877/trump-greenland-annexation-threats-purchase-national-security-economic/" >his push to annex Greenland</a> in recent weeks, many world leaders have raised vocal objections.</p>



<p>Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. But Trump has claimed that the U.S. needs to take control of the island for &ldquo;national security&rdquo; reasons and that the European Union also &ldquo;needs&rdquo; the U.S. to annex the territory. The Trump Administration has suggested the possibility of using military force to acquire Greenland; White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month that &ldquo;utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo; And on Friday, Trump indicated that he may <a href="https://time.com/7346949/trump-greenland-tariffs-threat/" >impose tariffs</a> on nations that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go along with&rdquo; his plans for the territory.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Many European leaders, as well as other political figures around the world, have pushed back on Trump&rsquo;s plans to take over Greenland, however&mdash;and warned that an attack on the territory could have major consequences for the international world order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s what world leaders have said on the issue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Greenland</strong></h2>



<p>Greenland&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen <a href="https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/" >voiced his strong opposition</a> to the possibility of the U.S. taking control of the territory in a social media post earlier this month.</p>



<p>&ldquo;When the President of the United States talks about &lsquo;we need Greenland&rsquo; and connects us with Venezuela and military intervention, it&rsquo;s not just wrong, it&rsquo;s so disrespectful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy. This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The leaders of the territory&rsquo;s five political parties, including Nielsen, also <a href="https://time.com/7345221/trump-greenland-statement-denmark/" >released</a> a joint statement last week in which they rejected Trump&rsquo;s remarks on the island by saying, &ldquo;We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Nielsen again rebuked Trump, <a href="https://time.com/7345949/greenland-denmark-trump/" >saying</a> at a press conference, &ldquo;We are now facing a geopolitical crisis, and if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Denmark</strong></h2>



<p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen <a href="https://apnews.com/article/denmark-greenland-trump-2b12bb104faaaafda2ed270febfb0522"  target="_blank">told</a> broadcasters in her country this month that Trump&rsquo;s comments about taking control of Greenland &#8220;should be taken seriously.&rdquo; Frederiksen also warned that &ldquo;If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,&rdquo; saying that such an aggressive action would mark the end of NATO.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We will not accept a situation where we and Greenland are threatened in this way,&rdquo; she said.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Denmark said that it was <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" >strengthening its military presence</a> on and around the island.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>France</strong></h2>



<p>In December, French President Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2003391697808732561"  target="_blank">posted</a> on X that he &ldquo;reaffirmed France&rsquo;s unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;Greenland belongs to its people. Denmark stands as its guarantor.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Macron joined six other European leaders, including Frederiksen, in signing a <a href="https://stm.dk/statsministeriet/publikationer/faellesudtalelse-om-groenland/"  target="_blank">joint statement</a> that said, &ldquo;Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.&rdquo;</p>



<p>France was also among several European allies that dispatched military personnel to Greenland; Macron <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2011578747791819017"  target="_blank">said</a> on Wednesday that French military troops were &ldquo;already on their way&rdquo; there, and that more would arrive in the coming days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Italy</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://time.com/7304882/giorgia-meloni-interview/" >Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni</a> was among the seven European leaders who signed onto the joint statement earlier this month that defended Greenland&rsquo;s sovereignty. Last week, she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/italy-meloni-trump-us-greenland-denmark-military-action-c15bb5780c64f41fd44417599c10b7c9"  target="_blank">said</a> that she didn&rsquo;t believe the Trump Administration would take military action to annex the territory, adding that Italy wouldn&rsquo;t back an operation like that.</p>



<p>Meloni, one of Trump&rsquo;s closest allies on the continent, emphasized that &ldquo;international law must be fully defended,&rdquo; though when a reporter asked her about Trump&rsquo;s policies, she replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re asking when you say Italy must distance itself from the United States.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Poland</strong></h2>



<p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also signed onto the joint statement by European leaders this month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday, Tusk said that Poland won&rsquo;t send military troops to Greenland, unlike some other European allies. But he cautioned that a U.S. military operation there would be calamitous.</p>



<p>&ldquo;An attempt to take over (part of) a NATO member state by another NATO member state would be a political disaster,&rdquo; he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-will-not-send-soldiers-greenland-polish-pm-says-2026-01-15/"  target="_blank">said</a> at a press conference. &ldquo;It would be the end of the world as we know it, which guaranteed a world based on NATO solidarity, which held back the evil forces associated with communist terror or other forms of aggression.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Spain</strong></h2>



<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez defended Greenland&rsquo;s sovereignty in a <a href="https://x.com/sanchezcastejon/status/2003432652439962067"  target="_blank">post</a> on X in December.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity is central to the EU and to all nations of the world. Security in the Arctic is a priority on which we seek to work with allies and partners,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;We convey our full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland.&rdquo;</p>



<p>S&aacute;nchez also joined the other European leaders in signing the statement earlier this month that supported Greenland&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Germany</strong></h2>



<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was among the European leaders who signed the joint statement this month, and Germany was one of several allied European countries that said they would send military personnel to the territory.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The United Kingdom</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://time.com/collections/100-most-influential-people-2025/7273780/keir-starmer/" >U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer</a>, who was among the seven European leaders to sign onto the joint statement, has also reaffirmed Greenland&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark must decide the future of Greenland and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark,&rdquo; he told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9yq8znq37o"  target="_blank">BBC</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p>Nobel Prizes are not transferable. But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped a number of recipients or their family members from donating, selling, or&mdash;in some cases&mdash;trying and failing to sell their medals over the years.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>Venezuelan opposition leader Mar&iacute;a Corina Machado became the latest of the prestigious awards&rsquo; winners to join that list on Thursday, <a href="https://time.com/7346654/machado-trump-meeting-nobel-prize-venezuela/" >gifting her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize medal</a> to President Donald Trump while meeting with him at the White House in the wake of U.S. forces <a href="https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/" >capturing</a> Venezuelan President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro. </p>



<p>Machado <a href="https://x.com/FoxNews/status/2011982499509846355"  target="_blank">told</a> Fox News that she gave the medal to Trump, who has long coveted the Peace prize and openly campaigned for it before it was awarded to the Venezuelan opposition leader, because &ldquo;he deserves it.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#8220;I decided to present the Nobel Peace Prize medal on behalf of the people of Venezuela,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><em><a href="https://time.com/7346981/machado-venezuela-democracy-trump-nobel-prize/" >Machado Insists Trump Will Do What&rsquo;s Needed to Turn Venezuela Into a Democracy</a></em></p>



<p>The move has drawn criticism from some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/16/maria-corina-machado-giving-trump-nobel-peace-prize-medal-absurd-say-norwegian-politicians"  target="_blank">politicians</a> in Norway, where the prize is awarded. The Nobel committee itself clarified that &#8220;the Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,&rdquo; the Nobel committee <a href="https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable"  target="_blank">wrote</a> in a pointedly timed Friday press release. &ldquo;Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else&rsquo;s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Here are some other notable recipients of the Nobel Prize who decided not to keep their medals&mdash;and what they did with them, or tried to.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dmitry Muratov (Peace)</strong></h2>



<p>The Russian journalist won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 for fighting for press freedom and standing up to Russian authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He sold his medal the following year at auction for $103.5 million, which he gave to UNICEF&rsquo;s fund for Ukrainian refugee children. This is the highest price ever paid for a Nobel Prize medal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kofi Annan (Peace)</strong></h2>



<p>The former secretary-general of the United Nations was a co-recipient of the Peace prize in 2001. He was given the honor for his prioritization of human rights and for &ldquo;his commitment to the struggle to contain the spreading of the HIV virus in Africa and his declared opposition to international terrorism,&rdquo; according to the Nobel Foundation.</p>



<p>Following Annan&rsquo;s death in 2018, his widow, Nane Annan, donated his medal in 2024 to the United Nations&rsquo; office in Geneva so that, she said, his legacy could continue inspiring future generations. The medal remains on permanent display there.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Christian Lous Lange (Peace)</strong></h2>



<p>Lange, Norway&rsquo;s first Nobel Peace Prize laureate, received the honor in 1921 along with the Swede Hjalmar Branting for what the committee <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1921/summary/"  target="_blank">described</a> as &ldquo;their lifelong contributions to the cause of peace and organized internationalism.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Both Lange and Branting &ldquo;wanted to strengthen the new world organization the League of Nations,&rdquo; according to the Nobel Foundation. Branting was Sweden&rsquo;s Prime Minister at the time they were awarded the prize, while Lange became secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union&mdash;an international organization of national parliaments&mdash;in 1909 and managed the organization through the first World War. Lange later went on to become a member of the Nobel Committee in 1934.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lange family has loaned the prize to the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo, where it has been since 2005. It is the only original peace prize permanently on public display in Norway.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Carlos Saavedra Lamas (Peace)</strong></h2>



<p>The foreign minister of Argentina received the Peace prize in 1936 for his part in ending the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay. His medal was sold at auction for $1.1 million to a private Asian buyer. The estate of another private collector in New York, who had owned it for roughly a decade, made the sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>James Watson and Francis Crick (Medicine)</strong></h2>



<p>Watson and Crick, along with Maurice Wilkins, were awarded the 1962 prize in Medicine for discovering the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953, a breakthrough that propelled the field of molecular biology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The medal awarded to Crick, who died in 2004, was sold at auction by his heirs for $2 million in 2013 to Shanghai biotech executive Jack Wang.</p>

<p>Watson sold his own medal the following year for $4.76 million to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who later gave the prize back to the laureate. Watson died last year on Nov. 6. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>William Faulkner</strong> <strong>(Literature)</strong></h2>



<p>The author, known for modernist Southern Gothic classics including <em>The Sound and the Fury </em>and <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, won the Literature prize in 1949 for what the committee described as &ldquo;his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the modern American novel.&#8221; His medal went up for auction in 2016, but failed to sell: Bidding came to a stop at $425,000, failing to reach the minimum bid.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Knut Hamsun (Literature)</strong></h2>



<p>The current location of Hamsun&rsquo;s medal is unknown. The winner of the 1920 Literature prize&mdash;a Norwegian writer who received the award for <em>Growth of the Soil</em>, a 1917 novel that tells the story of a man settling and cultivating a farm in rural Norway<em> </em>that the Nobel committee called a &ldquo;monumental work&rdquo;&mdash;sold his medal to German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels as a gesture of thanks after meeting with him in 1943.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leon Lederman (Physics)</strong></h2>



<p>Lederman, who was a co-recipient of the Physics prize in 1988 for the discovery of a second type of neutrino, sold his medal in 2015 for $765,002 to cover medical expenses to treat his dementia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>David Thouless (Physics)</strong></h2>



<p>Thouless won the Physics prize in 2016 alongside two other British scientists for using a branch of mathematics known as topology to explain what happens when matter changes phases. His family donated the medal to Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge, where it is displayed for students.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255970107.jpg" alt="US-VENEZUELA-POLITICS-DIPLOMACY-MACHADO"/>



<p>A day after she gave President Donald Trump <a href="https://time.com/7346654/machado-trump-meeting-nobel-prize-venezuela/" >her Nobel Peace Prize medal</a>, Venezuelan opposition leader Mar&iacute;a Corina Machado insisted that her country was on an irreversible path toward democracy, even as Trump has spoken far more frequently in recent days about securing Venezuelan oil than bringing about free elections.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, Machado said she was &ldquo;profoundly confident&rdquo; that Venezuela would see an orderly transition and, eventually, free and fair elections, and that she trusted Trump to do what was necessary to make that happen.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Venezuela is going to be free,&rdquo; Machado said, adding that freedom would be achieved &ldquo;with the support of the people of the United States and President Donald Trump.&rdquo; She described the moment as the &ldquo;first steps of a true transition to democracy,&rdquo; while acknowledging that the process ahead would be &ldquo;very complex and difficult.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Her confidence stood in contrast to the Trump Administration&rsquo;s actions in Venezuela following the <a href="https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/" >Jan. 3 raid</a> that removed Nicol&aacute;s Maduro and sent him to the United States to face narco-trafficking charges. In the two weeks since, Trump has backed former Maduro loyalists&mdash;led by interim President Delcy Rodr&iacute;guez&mdash;to govern Venezuela in the short term, and has given little detail of plans to transition Venezuela into a democracy. Administration officials have argued that Rodr&iacute;guez represents the most stable option for maintaining order and ensuring cooperation, particularly on securing <a href="https://time.com/7346460/venezuela-oil-us-first-sale/" >Venezuela&rsquo;s vast energy reserves</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to urge the President on specific things,&rdquo; she said, describing their Oval Office meeting as an exchange of views rather than a negotiation. She said she was impressed by how closely Trump followed developments in Venezuela and said he was concerned about the well-being of its people, including political prisoners and their families.</p>



<p>Machado said she believed the remnants of what she called a &ldquo;criminal structure&rdquo; that had dominated Venezuela for years would eventually dismantle themselves, paving the way for democratic institutions to be rebuilt. While she offered no details on how or when that would occur, she said that once the transition advanced, Venezuelans would be able to choose their leaders freely, including governors, mayors, and the National Assembly.</p>



<p>Her comments also came amid clear signs of competing courtships of the Trump Administration. Coinciding with her White House visit, CIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled to Caracas to meet Rodr&iacute;guez, the highest-level known U.S. visit since Maduro&rsquo;s removal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machado&rsquo;s efforts to win Trump&rsquo;s favor have frustrated some Venezuelans, particularly after the U.S. President dismissed the idea of installing her as the country&rsquo;s leader, arguing she lacked sufficient support in the short term. White House officials have echoed that assessment publicly, even as a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/venezuela-survey-trump-maduro-removal-us-relations-poll/"  target="_blank">poll of Venezuelans</a> released this week by Caracas&#8209;based firm Megan&aacute;lisis found 78% would vote for Machado in a presidential election.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Machado insisted that her goal was not personal power. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to seek anything for myself,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We have a huge task in front of us to prepare with other teams around the world and in Venezuela to take our government when the right time arrives.&rdquo;</p>



<p>She also portrayed Venezuela&rsquo;s future as closely aligned with U.S. interests. A democratic Venezuela, she said, would become one of the United States&rsquo; closest allies in the hemisphere and a society &ldquo;profoundly pro-America.&rdquo;</p>



<p>For now, the gap remains wide between Trump&rsquo;s rhetoric and Machado&rsquo;s hopes as Trump continues to celebrate cooperation with Rodr&iacute;guez&rsquo;s government on oil and security, deflecting questions about elections and focusing instead on stability and profits.</p>



<p>Machado said she was convinced that those priorities would ultimately converge.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that President Trump, his administration and the people of the United States support democracy, justice and freedom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is a hard process. But the result will be a proud Venezuela&mdash;free, democratic and ready to move forward.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump-Tariffs-Greenland.jpg" alt="President Trump Hosts Roundtable On Rural Health Transformation"/>



<p>President Donald Trump has floated the idea of levying tariffs against countries that don&rsquo;t back his plans to <a href="https://time.com/7346819/can-trump-pull-united-states-out-of-nato-legal-experts/" >take over Greenland</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I may put a tariff on countries if they don&rsquo;t go along with Greenland because we need Greenland for national security,&rdquo; Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLt-Ma0mTMw"  target="_blank">said</a> on Friday, at an unrelated event at the White House. &ldquo;So I may do that.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="https://time.com/7342994/trump-maduro-regime-change-maga/" >U.S. military operation in Venezuela</a> that led to the <a href="https://time.com/7342864/venezuela-caracas-strikes-trump/" >capture</a> of the South American country&rsquo;s president, Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, Trump has <a href="https://time.com/7346104/trump-greenland-annexation-threat-us-control/" >doubled down</a> on his desire to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. He has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. needs Greenland for &ldquo;national security&rdquo; reasons.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Right now Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,&rdquo; he <a href="https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/" >told</a> reporters aboard Air Force One earlier this month. &ldquo;We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security. And Denmark is not going to be able to do it.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://time.com/7344877/trump-greenland-annexation-threats-purchase-national-security-economic/" ><em>Why Is Trump So Intent on Acquiring Greenland?</em></a></p>



<p>While Trump has claimed that the European Union also &ldquo;needs&rdquo; the U.S. to take control of the territory, European leaders have strongly objected to the idea. Seven of the top leaders on the continent defended Greenland&rsquo;s sovereignty in a <a href="https://stm.dk/statsministeriet/publikationer/faellesudtalelse-om-groenland/"  target="_blank">joint statement</a> earlier this month, saying that &ldquo;it is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.&rdquo; And the same week, Greenland&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen <a href="https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/" >told</a> the U.S. to back off.</p>



<p>&ldquo;No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation,&rdquo; he said in a post on social media.</p>



<p>&ldquo;When the President of the United States talks about &lsquo;we need Greenland&rsquo; and connects us with Venezuela and military intervention, it&rsquo;s not just wrong, it&rsquo;s so disrespectful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy. This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.&rdquo;</p>



<p>U.S. officials met with the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark at the White House on Wednesday, but those talks failed to resolve the parties&rsquo; differences, with Danish Foreign Minister Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen saying that there is still a &ldquo;fundamental disagreement&rdquo; between Denmark and the U.S. over the fate of the territory. Also on Wednesday, Denmark announced that it was <a href="https://time.com/7346397/denmark-greenland-military-presence-nato-trump/" >bolstering its military presence</a> on and around Greenland. Some European NATO allies, including Sweden and Germany, said they would dispatch military personnel to the territory, too.</p>



<p>The Trump Administration has indicated that using force could be on the table in the push to acquire Greenland, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying earlier this month that &ldquo;utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo; Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/denmark-greenland-trump-2b12bb104faaaafda2ed270febfb0522"  target="_blank">warned</a> that a U.S. attack on Greenland would mark the end of NATO, of which both the U.S. and Denmark are founding members. Experts, meanwhile, have <a href="https://time.com/7344877/trump-greenland-annexation-threats-purchase-national-security-economic/" >told</a> TIME that taking over Greenland is not necessary for Trump to achieve his goals with respect to national security&mdash;and contended that staying in NATO is much more important to U.S. national security.</p>



<p>While Trump has not previously threatened to impose tariffs on nations that object to his plans for Greenland, the President has often deployed that tactic in <a href="https://time.com/7345774/trump-iran-tariffs-trade-china-india-uae-turkiye-brazil/" >other policy disagreements</a>.</p>

<p>After talks between the Greenland and Denmark foreign ministers and U.S. officials on Wednesday yielded no results, President Donald Trump was met with questions as to what his next steps might be. Talking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump&mdash;who continues to ramp up <a href="https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/" >pressure on Greenland</a> in his desire to annex the territory&mdash;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zlL_-YBczw"  target="_blank">refused to rule out</a> the option of leaving NATO.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;Greenland is very important for the national security,&rdquo; said Trump, doubling down on his argument about the Kingdom of Denmark territory. He went on to say the U.S. &ldquo;cannot rely on Denmark&rdquo; to protect Greenland from Russian and Chinese interests and warned that he has many options to explore. &ldquo;You found that out last week with Venezuela,&#8221; said Trump, referencing the operation that resulted in the <a href="https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/" >capture</a> and detainment of the fallen Venezuelan President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro and his wife, <a href="https://time.com/7343188/who-is-cilia-flores-maduro-wife-venezuela-politics/" >Cilia Flores</a>.</p>



<p>Danish Foreign Minister Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen said there remains a &ldquo;fundamental disagreement&rdquo; between Denmark and the U.S. as to what lies ahead for Greenland. In a display of strength, Denmark announced an expansion of its military presence on and around the island on Wednesday. Several European NATO allies followed suit, with Sweden and Germany among the countries committing to send military personnel to the territory.</p>



<p>Denmark&rsquo;s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Thursday said Greenland&rsquo;s defence was a &ldquo;common concern&rdquo; for all of NATO. Echoing that sentiment, Danish Defence Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, told reporters in Copenhagen that Denmark is planning to have a &#8220;larger and more permanent&#8221; NATO presence to ensure the island&rsquo;s security. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;crucial to show that security in the Arctic is not only for the Kingdom of Denmark, it is for all of NATO,&rdquo; said Poulsen.</p>



<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte earlier this week expressed the importance of &ldquo;the Arctic and Arctic security, because we know that with sea lanes opening up there is a risk that the Russians and the Chinese will be more active.&rdquo; Noting the geopolitical significance of the island&rsquo;s location, he said discussions are ongoing as to how to keep it secure.</p>



<p>But Trump, who has repeatedly aired his grievances with the alliance, argued that anything less than <a href="https://time.com/7346104/trump-greenland-annexation-threat-us-control/" >U.S. control of Greenland is &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo;</a> and has insisted that NATO &ldquo;should be leading the way for [the U.S.] to get it.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump previously floated the idea of leaving NATO over other disputes, and as he refuses to rule out that possibility this time, concerns are mounting over the U.S&rsquo; relationship with the alliance. </p>



<p>TIME spoke to legal experts about whether Trump could legally pull the U.S. out of NATO, should he pursue that avenue, and the wider implications at play.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is NATO?</strong></h2>



<p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has grown over the years since its formation in 1949, with 32 countries now part of the Western alliance.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nato.int/en/about-us/nato-history/a-short-history-of-nato"  target="_blank">According to NATO</a>, the organization was founded based on three principles: &ldquo;Deterring Soviet expansionism, forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in Europe through a strong North American presence on the continent, and encouraging European political integration.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In the aftermath of World War II, a race ensued between allies in western Europe and the Soviet Union to assert influence over other countries on the continent amid elections and <a href="https://scalar.usc.edu/works/dissolution-of-czechoslovakia/1948-czechoslovak-coup-dtat"  target="_blank">coups</a> in central Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increased American interest in foreign intervention, especially in Europe, saw the U.S., Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United Kingdom sign <a href="https://www.nato.int/en/about-us/organization/founding-treaty"  target="_blank">the Washington Treaty</a>, or the North Atlantic Treaty, in April 1949. The treaty, which still forms the basis of NATO today, consists of 14 Articles.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all,&rdquo; reads Article 5.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When did the U.S. join NATO?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. has remained a core NATO member since its foundation. In an address following the Treaty&rsquo;s formation in April 1949, President <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-occasion-the-signing-the-north-atlantic-treaty"  target="_blank">Harry Truman said</a>: &ldquo;In this pact, we hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear of aggression.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The nations represented here are bound together by ties of long standing. We are joined by a common heritage of democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law. These are the ties of a peaceful way of life. In this pact we are merely giving them formal recognition,&rdquo; he continued.</p>



<p>NATO <a href="https://www.nato.int/en/about-us/organization/nato-member-countries"  target="_blank">expanded</a> throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, with countries including Turkey and Greece joining in the early 1950s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We do not keep security establishments merely to defend property or territory or rights abroad or at sea. We keep the security forces to defend a way of life,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nato.int/en/about-us/nato-history/a-short-history-of-nato"  target="_blank">said President Dwight Eisenhower</a> of the treaty in 1954.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What has Trump said about potentially leaving NATO?</strong></h2>



<p>During his first term in the White House (and the early months of his second term), Trump aired his grievances with NATO, largely over defense spending and how much each member country contributes. He argued that the U.S. shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay the most towards defense. </p>



<p>In August 2018, Trump referenced conversations he had with NATO officials from the previous year. &ldquo;Someone said &lsquo;would you leave us if we don&rsquo;t pay our bills?&rsquo; They hated my answer. I said, &lsquo;Yeah, I would consider it,&rdquo; recalled <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/trump-confirms-he-threatened-to-withdraw-from-nato/"  target="_blank">Trump</a>. (<a href="https://www.nato.int/content/dam/nato/legacy-wcm/media_pdf/pdf_2019_03/190314-pr2018-34-eng.pdf"  target="_blank">In 2018</a>, European countries spent on average 1.5% of GDP on defense, compared to the U.S. rate of 3.39%.)</p>



<p>In December 2024, before returning to the White House for his second term, Trump said NATO had been &ldquo;taking advantage&rdquo; of the U.S., and said the U.S. would only remain a member if the others &ldquo;pay their bills.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://time.com/7297698/nato-2025-summit-trump-iran-ukraine-defense-topics/" >Trump succeeded</a> in getting NATO leaders to agree to raise defence spending to 5% of each countries&#8217; economic output by 2035.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255807009.jpg" alt="TOPSHOT-DENMARK-GREENLAND-POLITICS-DAILY LIFE" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can Trump legally leave NATO?</strong></h2>



<p>The National Defense Authorization Act of 2024 &ldquo;sought to place a firm legal brake on any future attempt to pull the United States out of NATO by prohibiting a President from doing so without either a two-thirds Senate super-majority or an act of Congress,&rdquo; says Ilaria Di Gioia, senior lecturer in American law at Birmingham City University. &ldquo;Yet those legal constraints remain far from solid.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Gioia says there&rsquo;s a number of ways in which Trump could look for a work-around, should he seriously wish to pull the U.S. out of the alliance.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Trump could seek to circumvent Congress&rsquo; statutory constraint by invoking presidential authority over foreign policy, an approach he has floated before to bypass congressional limits on treaty withdrawal,&rdquo; Gioia explains in an email to TIME. &ldquo;It is unclear whether any party would have legal standing to challenge such a move in court. The most plausible plaintiff would be Congress itself, but with the Republicans in control of the Senate, political support for such a lawsuit is far from assured. The result would be a constitutional confrontation between the Executive [branch] and Congress, with the courts as the likely referee.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump has repeatedly stated that the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland as a matter of &ldquo;national security.&rdquo; According to Gioia, the President could seek to use this argument legitimately. Trump &ldquo;could frame NATO withdrawal as necessary for national defense, citing broad Commander-in-Chief authority (<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/section-2/"  target="_blank">Article II, Section 2</a>),&rdquo; she says.</p>



<p>Curtis Bradley, Allen M. Singer distinguished service professor of law at the University of Chicago, highlights that there is, at least, some precedent, citing President <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1977-80v13/d171"  target="_blank">Jimmy Carter&#8217;s withdrawal </a>from a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan in 1978, which was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12503"  target="_blank">formalized in 1980</a>. But still, given the National Defense Authorization Act of 2024, if Trump were to pull the U.S. out of NATO, it would be far from easy and there could well be legal fallout.</p>



<p>Bradley notes that due to the Supreme Court often ruling in favor of the Trump Administration, Congress may find it difficult to win against him in the courts, but legal backlash could stem from elsewhere</p>



<p>&ldquo;If there are contractors with NATO that could lose money from the U.S. withdrawal, that would be an economic injury that would potentially give them a standing to sue,&rdquo; he states.</p>



<p>Despite Trump having options, the legalities involved are, at best, murky, the experts agree.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The very idea of a U.S. exit erodes trust, cohesion, and the credibility of collective defense,&rdquo; says Gioia, highlighting that the mere suggestion of the U.S. leaving NATO has, in itself, caused a lot of damage. &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s repeated questioning of the alliance weakens deterrence, shakes European security planning, and emboldens adversaries.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referring to the alliance as the &ldquo;most important mutual defense treaty of the post-WWII era,&rdquo; Bradley says a U.S. exit would be surprising, and that it&rsquo;s far more likely we&rsquo;ll see continued &ldquo;tensions with NATO&rdquo; rather than a formal withdrawal. &ldquo;But Trump has surprised me on other things,&rdquo; he notes.</p>

<p>The age of trade protectionism returned to America in 2025 with the shudder of a closing customs gate. President Donald Trump has long professed his love of tariffs, once calling them &ldquo;<a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-inauguration-executive-orders-capitol-one-arena-january-20-2025/"  target="_blank">the most beautiful word</a>&rdquo; in the dictionary. In February 2025, barely a month into his second term, Trump breached the trade agreement he himself negotiated with Canada and Mexico in 2018, and imposed new tariffs on both countries. In February and March 2025, he moved to impose tariffs on China.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>April 2025 turned out to be the cruelest month: Trump<a href="https://time.com/7305626/chaotic-world-of-trumps-tariffs/" > announced</a> tariffs on imports from virtually all countries. Those tariff actions were shocking not only because Trump invoked a law that no other president had used to impose tariffs, but also because he raised rates&mdash;on adversaries and allies alike&mdash;to levels unseen since the 1930s.</p>



<p>Americans noticed and began acquainting themselves with the world of tariffs. Internet searches for &ldquo;tariff&rdquo; noticeably<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2017-01-01%202025-11-18&amp;geo=US&amp;q=tariff&amp;hl=en"  target="_blank"> trended up</a> throughout 2025 and the word entered daily conversations and supermarket aisles. But tariffs aren&rsquo;t new. Tariffs are one of the oldest tools of American economic policy.</p>



<p>After its birth as a nation, the United States used tariffs to ensure a steady flow of revenue to finance its government and support its infant industries. After the Civil War, the U.S. didn&rsquo;t rely heavily on tariffs to generate revenue but used them to protect domestic industry&mdash;northern industrialists and Midwestern farmers&mdash;from European competition.&nbsp; For years, Congress set tariff rates item by item, and the debates over each line were susceptible to capture by special interests.</p>



<p>The pattern was on blatant display in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930: conceived to protect farmers, it quickly expanded into something larger. The economic disruption that followed forced a rethink of trade policy, and Congress responded by ceding more authority to the President. Democrats and Republicans continued squabbling over the content of trade policy, but the protectionist impulse largely receded and was replaced by a consensus that lower trade barriers would support economic recovery and advance broader foreign policy goals.<strong> </strong>Today, that consensus has reversed.</p>



<p>A bipartisan shift toward trade protectionism in the United States came about in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the rise of China, and the fading of America&rsquo;s unipolar moment. Unlike earlier periods of protectionism, this new chapter was not triggered by a single external economic shock so much as by the accumulation of domestic anxieties.</p>



<p>The first Trump Administration&rsquo;s move to raise and entrench tariffs in 2017, justified in the name of &ldquo;economic security&rdquo; marked the start of this era. President Joe Biden largely followed the same course. The trend is likely to continue unless it results in significant and persistent economic pain and political backlash.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Old tools for new threats</h3>



<p>At the start of President Trump&rsquo;s second term, the average U.S. tariff rate stood at roughly 2.4 %. Today, the overall effective tariff rate is 16.8 %, the highest it&rsquo;s been since 1935, according to the<a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-november-17-2025"  target="_blank"> Yale Budget Lab</a>. While the scope and scale of tariffs was comparably smaller in his first term in office, Trump did start a trade war with China, and slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum, while threatening many others. President Biden kept most of the<a href="https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart"  target="_blank"> tariffs on China</a> and others in place, but he also added tariffs on electric vehicles, solar cells, and battery parts. Since his return to the White House, Trump has expanded trade protection to unexpected levels, and in a dizzying way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2152413125.jpg" alt="President Biden Speaks On American Investments And Jobs Agenda" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>A common thread between the Trump and Biden years is a &ldquo;<a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/31/remarks-by-heather-boushey-on-how-president-bidens-invest-in-america-agenda-has-laid-the-foundation-for-decades-of-strong-stable-and-sustained-equitable-growth/"  target="_blank">paradigm shift</a>&rdquo; in thinking about U.S. foreign economic policy, one that fuses national security interests with economic ones. The term &ldquo;economic security&rdquo; is increasingly used in Washington to describe the use of economic tools as leverage to achieve certain domestic and foreign policy goals. Much of the narrative on economic security is fueled by fears of China&rsquo;s rise, and the belief that<a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/dangers-misunderstanding-economic-interdependence#weaponized-interdependence-power-self-fulfilling-prophecies"  target="_blank"> economic interdependence</a> poses a threat to U.S. hegemony in the world. Export controls, industrial policy, trade barriers, and strategic foreign investments all play a role in this policy toolkit.</p>



<p>The idea of using economic tools to support U.S. national security interests has a long history, but the concept of national security has become more expansive today. Politicians are no longer just concerned about armed conflicts or terrorism. Energy security, food security, climate change, and public health have all been elevated to essential security concerns. This expansive conception of national security goes to the heart of the slippery logic of economic security&mdash;a term so broadly defined that it threatens to become a catchall for the general welfare of the American people. In the process, this understanding fails to distinguish between legitimate economic security concerns and trade protectionism, because, under such a definition,&nbsp; everything is potentially a threat.</p>



<p>Debates about the use of tariffs to advance general welfare date to the Republic&rsquo;s early years. In 1824, Henry Clay, the era&rsquo;s most persuasive apostle of congressional power, proposed high, across-the-board tariffs to reduce dependence on imports, shield young American industries from British competition, and support the development of a reliable domestic &ldquo;home market&rdquo; for American farmers and manufacturers.<strong> </strong>It was a major call for nation-building.</p>



<p>Thomas Jefferson, who had retired in 1809, was living at<a href="https://www.monticello.org/"  target="_blank"> Monticello</a>, and working toward establishing the University of Virginia, felt compelled to respond<strong>.</strong> In a letter to his friend James Madison, he shared a draft proposal for the Virginia General Assembly, warning that Clay&rsquo;s proposals amounted to abuse of Congress&rsquo; constitutional powers. The Constitution, he argued, did not grant lawmakers &ldquo;the power to do whatever they may think, or pretend, would promote the general welfare&hellip; without limitation of powers.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Madison and Jefferson were not doctrinaire opponents of tariffs; they supported some modest and temporary tariffs. But Clay&rsquo;s sweeping tariffs, they believed, went too far&mdash;interfering with the spirit of free enterprise and failed to represent the diverse industrial interests in the country. They feared that such tariffs would drive up the costs of imported goods Americans would buy anyway, since many of those products were not produced domestically. And they foresaw high tariffs would invite a perverse scramble among favored industries for additional protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, Congress ceded much of its<a href="https://www.cfr.org/report/tariffs-trading-partners-can-president-actually-do"  target="_blank"> power over trade policy</a> to the president</p>



<p>in the hope that the executive branch would better represent national interests over the parochial concerns of Congress. While Congress still retains the power to regulate trade, and develop clear objectives for trade policy, the arrival of the age of economic security threatens to diminish this role. The central theme of President Trump&rsquo;s 2017<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf"  target="_blank"> National Security Strategy</a> was &ldquo;economic security is national security.&rdquo;</p>



<p>This braiding of economic and national security has, in practice, meant that presidents have expanded their influence over the economic lives of Americans, often without congressional oversight. Trump has argued that Congress handed over its authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations through a series of laws&mdash;laws that he has used to impose tariffs. Biden, for his part, claimed that the Constitution itself confers upon the president broad discretion to<a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/congress-asserts-its-trade-authority-taiwan-trade-deal"  target="_blank"> negotiate trade deals</a> without congressional input.</p>



<p>Many presidents have invoked national security to justify executive action across a range of policy areas, but its encroachment into the economic sphere minimizes the checks and balances that have traditionally played an important role in debates over economic policy. If a president can take any action so long as it can be tethered, even tenuously, to national security&mdash;including imposing trade restrictions on mundane things like beer cans and furniture&mdash;what meaningful limits remain on his power? Trump&rsquo;s penchant for wielding emergency powers and national security rationales to take trade action has shone a spotlight on this problem. Yet Congress has done little to challenge it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An inconvenient truth</h3>



<p>Over the past several months, the Trump Administration&rsquo;s focus on signing deals to reduce the highest tariff rates imposed on Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liberation Day&rdquo; suggests a wrinkle in the administration&rsquo;s national security rationale. If punishing tariffs are supposed to protect Americans, why would the administration agree to lower them at all? From the outset, trade experts raised the alarm on Trump&rsquo;s tariff policy and warned that such high trade barriers would have significant negative consequences on the U.S. economy.</p>



<p>Trump floated several different tariff figures&mdash;from 10 to 100 %&mdash;before raising the average U.S. tariff to 1909 levels (22.5 %). The move sent stock markets tumbling. He quickly backtracked, and claimed that the threat was simply a tactic to bring countries to the negotiating table and compel them to lower their trade barriers. As a result, tariff rates are nowhere near the levels Trump announced in April, and their impact was more limited than feared, as companies had braced for something much worse.</p>



<p>Consider the tariffs Trump imposed on Canada and Mexico in February: lower rates were swiftly secured for fertilizer and energy, out of fear that these measures would hurt American farmers. Trade that complied with the 2018 U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was also exempted. In total, nearly<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/05/business/economy/trump-tariffs-us-imports.html"  target="_blank"> 46 %</a> of U.S. imports have been exempted from Trump&rsquo;s tariffs. The sheer breadth of these exemptions reveals the shallowness of the national security rationale the Trump Administration invoked to justify the tariffs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The price of tariffs</h3>



<p>The wide-ranging tariff exemptions suggest that a large chunk of U.S. imports provide economic benefits, and that the United States does not face equal risk from its interdependence with every trading partner. The Biden Administration, to a degree, recognized the imperative to work with allies to advance economic security objectives, but it did so while harboring<a href="https://hewlett.org/the-post-neoliberal-imperative/"  target="_blank"> deep skepticism</a> toward trade as an instrument of bolstering American economic opportunity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254201595.jpg" alt="China Manufacturing Industry" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The second Trump administration is even more distrustful. But has this skepticism strengthened U.S. economic security? So far, there is no evidence to suggest that the tariffs have made the American economy more secure. In fact,<a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/global-trade-war-update"  target="_blank"> economists estimate</a> that if Trump&rsquo;s tariffs stay in place, the U.S. will have slower economic growth, higher prices, and lower employment over the coming decade.</p>



<p>Those hit hardest by tariffs are small businesses, which make up<a href="https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/small-businesses-big-burden-the-cost-of-tariffs"  target="_blank"> 97 %</a> of U.S. importers. In September, they shed<a href="https://mediacenter.adp.com/2025-10-01-ADP-National-Employment-Report-Private-Sector-Employment-Shed-32,000-Jobs-in-September-Annual-Pay-was-Up-4-5"  target="_blank"> 40,000</a> jobs. These businesses have a harder time navigating erratic policy shifts. They also don&rsquo;t have the ability to absorb all the costs like big firms, or to negotiate with suppliers. This leaves them with little option but to raise prices. And, those that search for alternative, American sources for their products, often can&rsquo;t<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/bigs/us-trade-uncertainty-buffeting-small-business"  target="_blank"> find or afford</a> them.</p>



<p>Consumers will also feel the pinch. While businesses front-loaded imports, they held off on raising prices because of<a href="https://x.com/FT/status/1950111576687538535?s=20"  target="_blank"> fluctuations</a> in Trump&rsquo;s tariff policy. But, as tariffs have begun to settle, their costs have been increasingly passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. While only 37 % of those costs were passed on to consumers up until August, Goldman Sachs estimates that<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-businesses-consumers-shoulder-bulk-120022577.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJ-q2y5pR1zQaaIZbxvd-wkGKgz_jy_m-uXG7mfLQ6STKHk5M_6FOGJLy_wWgTEfkDJyOcP2RyWaHD-RWPsQpBmN79y9ykfBN5iXtLnK0oeFeZHXhbMCbQI5UpcZssJ6hBIMtwIp2oR5bYYsXbnHSpRr8JbJ5LyCRYfKhGJrg2E-&amp;guccounter=2"  target="_blank"> 55 %</a> of the tariff costs are expected to be paid by consumers by January. It&rsquo;s no surprise that Americans are anxious about the<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/not-just-affordability-americans-anxious-110000575.html"  target="_blank"> economy and losing their jobs</a>.</p>



<p>American allies are also anxious about whether they can count on the U.S. at all. Canadian Prime Minister<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/americas/canada-trump-tariffs-response-latam-intl"  target="_blank"> Mark Carney</a> described the U.S. as &ldquo;no longer a reliable partner,&rdquo; and ramped up efforts to diversify Canada&rsquo;s trade links. Canada is<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/article/gripen-versus-f-35-the-fight-for-a-canadian-contract/"  target="_blank"> reportedly</a> considering Swedish-built fighter jets over American ones. French President<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/27/europe/macron-eu-security-intl"  target="_blank"> Emmanuel Macron</a> voiced similar sentiments, urging European partners to &ldquo;guarantee our own security.&rdquo; These expressions of concern reflect<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/11/views-of-the-united-states/"  target="_blank"> growing unfavourability</a> of the U.S. around the world. If this rift is not temporary, it will be difficult to leverage those partnerships to support American interests in the future.</p>



<p>The Trump Administration&rsquo;s use of tariffs as a tool to bolster economic security has therefore yielded little payoff. It has also moved debates over trade and tariffs away from Congress and concentrated that power in the hands of the executive branch under the banner of national and economic security. Yet tariffs have made Americans neither more secure nor more prosperous. And the piecemeal trade deals being negotiated now are unlikely to fare any better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question that lingers is how long Americans will put up with government intrusions into their lives to serve vague notions of economic security. In the meantime, tariffs will persist, their economic effects will ripple throughout the economy, and America will have fewer friends around the world.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump is &ldquo;making China great again,&rdquo; according to the results of a new <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/how-trump-is-making-china-great-again-and-what-it-means-for-europe/"  target="_blank">survey</a> by the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p>



<p>The survey of about 26,000 people found that most respondents in almost all 21 participating countries believed that China will have more global influence over the next decade. Meanwhile, opinions of the U.S. among its traditional allies and adversaries have shifted, while generally expectations of Trump have fallen a year into his presidency.</p>

[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]



<p>&ldquo;A year on from Trump&rsquo;s return, in countries across the globe, many people believe China is on the verge of becoming even more powerful,&rdquo; the report said.</p>



<p>The survey was conducted by ECFR and Oxford University&rsquo;s Europe in a Changing World in November 2025, prior to the <a href="https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/" >U.S. abduction of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro</a> in January. The 21 countries that participated were Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, the U.K., Ukraine, the U.S., and 10 E.U. countries (Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain). The views of the E.U. countries were represented by a simple average of each country&rsquo;s results.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Even before Trump&rsquo;s dramatic intervention in Venezuela, his aggressive &lsquo;America first&rsquo; approach was driving people closer to China,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;Paradoxically, his disavowal of the liberal international order may have given people licence to build stronger links to Beijing, since they no longer feel the need to fall in line with a US-led alliance system.&rdquo;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Growing Chinese influence</h2>



<p>South Africa led the view of China as a global leader, with 83% of respondents believing that China will have more global influence over the next decade. That was followed by 72% in Brazil and 63% in Turkey. In the U.S., 54% of respondents held that view, as did an average 53% of respondents across the 10 E.U. countries surveyed. The U.K. had the fewest respondents who held that view, with just 50% believing China&rsquo;s global influence will grow.</p>



<p>But a substantial portion of respondents in each territory, including the U.K., the U.S. and the E.U., also held the view that China&rsquo;s influence would not change over the next decade, because it already has global influence now.</p>



<p>Respondents in several places attributed China&rsquo;s rise to its <a href="https://time.com/7309264/nvidia-trump-china-chips-deal-h20-blackwell-national-security-concerns/" >technological</a> and <a href="https://time.com/7277920/china-manufacturing-us-trump-factory-workers-ai-videos-social-media/" >manufacturing power</a>. Most respondents in China and the E.U. think that China will lead the world in the production of <a href="https://time.com/7288660/shift-east-china-electric-vehicles-economy-technology-trump-tariffs-ai/" >electric vehicles</a> in a decade. That view, as well as the view that China will lead in renewable technology and renewable energy, has become more popular among E.U. and U.S. respondents over the past two years.</p>



<p>Few people seemed concerned about China&rsquo;s rise. Only in Ukraine and <a href="https://time.com/7345772/china-japan-south-korea-relations-export-controls-taiwan/" >South Korea</a> did a majority of respondents consider China as either a rival or an adversary. In fact, a growing number of people view China as an ally or a necessary strategic partner as compared to last year, according to the think tank.</p>



<p>Even in the U.S., China&rsquo;s geopolitical rival, 41% of respondents view China as a necessary partner. And in India, 47% of people see China as an ally or necessary partner. Relations between New Delhi and Beijing have historically been icy, but have <a href="https://time.com/7310270/china-india-us-trump-xi-modi-tariffs-trade-russia-oil/" >warmed in the past year against the backdrop of trade tensions</a> between the U.S. and India straining relations.</p>



<p>Several places also expected their relationship with China to strengthen in the next five years, led by 71% of respondents in South Africa and 52% of respondents in Brazil.</p>



<p>&ldquo;China&rsquo;s rise is seen as something that suits people living in most non-Western countries. Life without a hegemon is how most people appear to imagine the post-American world,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;From the perspective of much of the global public, the multipolar order is perfectly compatible with the world of &lsquo;China First.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>



<p>That is in keeping with Beijing&rsquo;s posture. China has sought to &ldquo;work with other countries to &lsquo;democratise international relations&rsquo; by giving non-Western countries more of a voice,&rdquo; the think tank said. Beijing has been <a href="https://time.com/7298254/china-us-diplomacy-military-intervention-taiwan-israel-iran-war-ceasefire/" >positioning itself as a diplomatic alternative</a> to the U.S. and <a href="https://time.com/7301187/china-visa-free-travel-countries-tourism-us-trump-isolation-economy/" >sought to contrast</a> its economic partnerships and participation in multilateral institutions with the <a href="https://time.com/7344810/trump-withdraw-unfccc-climate-impact/" >withdrawal of the U.S. under Trump from international forums</a> and its use of trade measures and the threat&mdash;or use&mdash;of direct military intervention to advance its interests.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are just 15 days into the year 2026, but the year already has seen black swans and grey rhinos one after the other. Instability and uncertainty are raging all around,&rdquo; China&rsquo;s U.S. envoy Xie Feng <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3340117/chinas-us-envoy-says-world-faces-stark-choice-2026-opens-instability"  target="_blank">said</a> in an address to the 1,000-member China General Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, in apparent reference to Trump. &ldquo;Where will the world be heading? Humanity is facing a grave choice. Peace or war. Openness or isolation. Cooperation or confrontation.&rdquo;</p>



<p>While a survey published early last year by Singapore-based think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute that suggested <a href="https://time.com/7274803/southeast-asia-2025-survey-us-china-trust-asean-iseas-trump/" >more Southeast Asians would choose the U.S. over China</a>, the new survey suggests that many countries do not feel they have to choose between the two powers.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Our data suggest people around the world do not anticipate a bipolar, ideological struggle for primacy,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;On the contrary, with the US behaving like just another transactional great power under Trump&mdash;and China establishing itself as a giant of equal stature&mdash;people outside the traditional West seem to expect more room for their own countries to grow and thrive.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Still, some observers have raised concerns that Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7343019/venezuela-trump-oil-china/" >flouting of international norms</a> could encourage Russia and China to more aggressively establish their <a href="https://time.com/7343085/venezuela-trump-us-maduro-china-taiwan-analysis/" >own spheres of influence</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Poorer views of Trump</h2>



<p>Although China is seen as rising in global influence, people don&rsquo;t generally see the U.S. disappearing, even if they don&rsquo;t see its influence rising.</p>



<p>In China, Russia, the U.K., Switzerland, Ukraine, the E.U., South Korea, and even the U.S., a minority of respondents think the U.S. will have more global influence over the next decade than it does today. Around a quarter of respondents in China, Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. think the U.S. will decline in global influence.</p>



<p>Most countries still see the U.S. as an ally or necessary partner, especially among traditional friends of the U.S., including 89% percent of South Koreans, 88% of Ukrainians, and 76% of Indians.</p>



<p>But across the E.U., just 16% of respondents consider the U.S. an ally whereas 20% of respondents consider it a rival or adversary. In some E.U. member states, nearly 30% of respondents see the U.S. as a rival or adversary, according to the report.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This change may be down to Washington&rsquo;s very public and at times brutal reappraisal of Europe, its politics and its culture,&rdquo; the report said, &ldquo;rather than any real deterioration in American power.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Last year, Trump imposed a series of <a href="https://time.com/7306868/trump-tariffs-tracker-countries-rates-sectors-trade-deals-deadlines-timeline/" >broad tariffs</a> on E.U. imports&mdash;including steep duties on steel, aluminum, automobiles, and other goods&mdash;as well as <a href="https://time.com/7301508/marco-rubio-asean-asia-indo-pacific-security-trump-tariffs-china/" >much of the rest of the world</a> and <a href="https://time.com/7302593/trump-tariffs-eu-trade-deal-china/" >leveraged trade relations with the U.S.</a>&mdash;the world&rsquo;s biggest economy&mdash;to secure deals more favorable to the U.S. Trump has also taken a volatile course in his approach to the <a href="https://time.com/7335666/trump-plan-to-end-russia-ukraine-war-zelensky-response/" >war between Russia and Ukraine</a>, at times publicly criticizing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and <a href="https://time.com/7265679/satellites-front-failing-hundreds-dead-fallout-trump-ukraine-aid-pause/" >pausing U.S. military support for Kyiv last March</a>, before reversing course.</p>



<p>The survey results predate the Trump Administration&rsquo;s renewed push in <a href="https://time.com/7344147/greenland-denmark-trump-takeover-independence-purchase-military-nato/" >wanting control of Greenland</a>, which is currently an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark.</p>

<p>The survey suggests that allies of the U.S. no longer see it as reliable. More Ukrainians think that their country&rsquo;s relations with the E.U. will strengthen over the next five years than that with the U.S.</p>



<p>On the other hand, more Russians consider the E.U. an adversary than the U.S. The Russian view of the U.S. as an adversary has fallen dramatically over the past two years, while its view of the U.S. as a necessary partner has risen.</p>



<p>&ldquo;America&rsquo;s traditional enemies fear it less than they once did&mdash;while allies now worry about falling victim to a predatory U.S.,&rdquo; the report said.</p>



<p>Looking forward to the next five years, nearly a quarter of respondents in the E.U. and the U.K. see their relations with the U.S. weakening. That increases to 37% in Switzerland, 35% in China, 28% in South Africa, and 27% in Turkey. Even so, many people see their relations with the U.S. strengthening, led by India where 62% of respondents hold that view.</p>



<p>A year into the second Trump Administration, most countries have lower expectations of Trump than they did a year ago. In the last survey conducted at the end of 2024, 84% of Indians saw Trump&rsquo;s electoral victory as a good thing for their country. That has dropped to just 53% of Indians now.</p>



<p>Last year, a survey by the Pew Research Center showed that an increasing number of respondents&mdash;particularly in Canada and Mexico&mdash;see the U.S. as <a href="https://time.com/7301192/threats-allies-pew-poll-responses-us-china-russia-canada-mexico/" >both a top ally and a major threat</a>. Both countries have not been exempt from Trump&rsquo;s tariffs or threats of U.S. intervention, while countries around the world, especially in the Global South, have felt the effects of the Trump Administration <a href="https://time.com/7298994/usaid-deaths-studies-estimates-foreign-aid-hiv-aids-malaria-sudan/" >slashing U.S. foreign aid</a>.</p>



<p>&ldquo;A year ago Trump was a welcome figure in a Trumpian world: people outside Europe and South Korea held very positive expectations about his return. But this Trumpian moment already appears to be over,&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;If there is a race for global popularity, America is currently losing to its Indo-Pacific rival.&rdquo;</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2221035876.jpg" alt="TOPSHOT-FRANCE-IRAN-POLITICS-PORTRAIT-DIPLOMACY"/>



<p>It&rsquo;s been just over a week since Reza Pahlavi, the exiled prince of Iran, set a high-stakes gamble in motion. Along with other activist groups and dissidents, he urged Iranians to take to the streets, betting that the nation had reached <a href="https://time.com/7345555/iran-protests-deaths-us-trump-israel/" >a point of rupture</a> with the Islamic Republic.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://time.com/7346197/iran-trump-protests-deaths/" ><em>Inside Iran, Protesters Urge Trump to Act: &lsquo;If Nothing Happens, It&rsquo;s a Catastrophe&rsquo;</em></a></p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Protesters have paid a staggering price. By <a href="https://time.com/7345347/iran-protests-death-toll-estimate-thousands/" >some accounts</a>, including an estimate by a Tehran doctor speaking with TIME, at least 20,000 demonstrators were killed by security forces in just three days.</p>



<p>Now, as fear and force push demonstrators indoors, Pahlavi says he and &ldquo;the Iranian people&rdquo; are counting on President Donald Trump to step in to protect them, even after the president<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-protesters-executions-195edfa07111be782db71af07b538fdc"  target="_blank"> said</a> on Wednesday he had been told &ldquo;the killing in Iran is stopping.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Iranian people see President Trump as a man of his word and believe he will follow through with the promise he made to defend them,&rdquo; Pahlavi told TIME on Thursday in written responses to a series of questions.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://time.com/7346661/trump-iran-military-strikes-diplomacy-sanctions/" ><em>For Trump, a Path Forward on Iran That Goes Beyond Bombs</em></a></p>



<p>Several Iranians told TIME they were emboldened by Trump&rsquo;s repeated warnings, dating back to <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186"  target="_blank">Jan. 2,</a> that if Iranian authorities killed protesters, &ldquo;We are locked and loaded and ready to go.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Based on conversations with Iranians and chants such as &ldquo;O&rsquo; king of Iran, come back to Iran, the mullahs have trashed the country&rdquo; that echoed across the rallies, many were also encouraged to march for Pahlavi. When asked if it was irresponsible to call Iranians into the streets without protection, Pahlavi placed the blame on Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader, his regime and &ldquo;their supporters in the West.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;They have the lives of tens of thousands of my bravest compatriots on their hands,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we will ensure their sacrifice is not in vain and we will win.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump has not offered details about how the U.S. may or may not respond to the killings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;My team and I are in touch with the administration,&rdquo; Pahlavi said, though he declined to discuss specifics of what he had asked the Administration for, and what, if anything, it had committed to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We do not need foreign boots on the ground, but we do need action that prevents the IRGC [the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] and security forces from continuing mass violence against the people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People need help to level the playing field.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump has been reluctant to lend his full support to Pahlavi, however. &#8220;He seems very nice, but I don&#8217;t know how he&#8217;d play within his own country,&#8221; the president&nbsp;said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Pahlavi has spent decades casting himself in this role. Iranians inside and outside Iran told TIME that in recent years, his popularity has surged, in part because no other opposition figures have the profile to unite and lead them. But Pahlavi remains polarizing. Some Iranians remember his father&rsquo;s reign as an era of development and close ties with the West; others recall authoritarianism and the notorious SAVAK secret police.</p>



<p>The 65-year-old laid out his plans for a secular post-Islamic Republic transition in a <a href="https://fund.nufdiran.org/projects/ipp/research/emergency-phase-booklet/"  target="_blank">roadmap</a> published online last July. The plan centers on a council with &ldquo;major interim state functions&rdquo;, its members appointed by him, alongside executive and judicial bodies whose leaders would be installed or removed with his approval.</p>



<p>After the regime falls, the plan calls for a referendum on the future system of government, either a &ldquo;democratic monarchy&rdquo; or a &ldquo;democratic republic.&rdquo; His role, he said, was to remain impartial and not &ldquo;tip the scales&rdquo; in favor of either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked if and how he would govern the country if people called upon him, he responded: &ldquo;The people must vote and decide on this.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Karim Parwizi, a member of the leadership of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran, an opposition group based in northern Iraq, argued that the roadmap leaves too much power in Pahlavi&rsquo;s hands.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is presented as the one who decides everything,&rdquo; he told TIME. &ldquo;That suggests the foundations of another dictatorship are being laid.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Pahlavi was born to be a king&mdash;the crown prince, long-awaited after Mohammad Reza Shah&rsquo;s two failed marriages, before his marriage to Farah Diba.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That trajectory was abruptly cut short.&nbsp;At 18, while Pahlavi was training to fly fighter jets at Reese Air Force Base in Lubbock, Texas, the 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled his father&rsquo;s rule.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1960262256.jpg" alt="Coronation Of Shah Of Iran" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>Pahlavi went on to earn a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in political science at the University of Southern California, got married, and now has three adult daughters. Living mostly in Los Angeles and the Washington D.C. area, he has continued to call for the fall of the Islamic Republic.</p>



<p>It is difficult, however, to determine the exact extent of his popular support among Iran&rsquo;s roughly 92 million people. </p>



<p>&ldquo;My view of it is that Reza Pahlavi is just simply being the leader to coordinate the removal of the regime,&rdquo; a resident of Shiraz, who heeded Pahlavi&rsquo;s calls to protest last week, told TIME on condition of anonymity. He added that he &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t mind if he becomes the next shah.&rdquo;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://gamaan.org/2025/08/20/analytical-report-on-iranians-political-preferences-in-2024/"  target="_blank">2024 survey</a> by the Netherlands-based research group Gamaan found that if Iran were to hold a free and fair election, Pahlavi would be the &ldquo;preferred candidate&rdquo; among more than 30 political and civil society figures.</p>



<p>&ldquo;He has symbolic importance in capturing the popular rejection of the Islamic Republic, and this owes a great deal to the nostalgia for his father and grandfather&rsquo;s periods,&rdquo; said Vali Nasr, a professor at Johns Hopkins University&rsquo;s School of Advanced International Studies. &ldquo;But I am not convinced his support is broad based and will be directed into a meaningful political movement.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Critics have said the exiled prince and his team have not done enough to unite opposition factions, both inside and outside Iran, or to reach out to minority ethnic groups, which are thought to make up about half of the country&rsquo;s population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Pahlavi and his colleagues have shown no indication of dialogue with ethnic minorities, not only Kurds but also Baluch, Turks and Arabs,&rdquo; said Amjad Hossein Panahi, a political member of the opposition Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan. &ldquo;There is no meaningful difference between him and the current regime.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Shirin Ebadi, Iran&rsquo;s 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, hopes Pahlavi, working alongside other groups, can help manage any transition. &ldquo;Let the regime fall,&rdquo; she said.</p>



<p>Many US government officials also see Pahlavi as the most viable opposition figure, a US-based analyst explained, &ldquo;partly because his group and the regime have spent so much time discrediting other opposition figures.&rdquo;<br><br>She spoke on condition of anonymity because, she claimed, some of Pahlavi&rsquo;s supporters in the Iranian diaspora are &ldquo;bullies.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Pahlavi, however, presents himself as a unifier. Many in Iran&rsquo;s opposition &ldquo;know only I can help lead the transition to democracy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is why I am stepping forward to lead.&rdquo;</p>



<p></p>



<p><em>Correction, Jan. 15</em></p>



<p><em>The original headline for this story mischaracterized what Reza Pahlavi said about President Trump. He said he believes Trump is &#8220;a man of his word,&#8221; not that he was appealing to Trump to be one.</em></p>

<p>Now he has his Nobel Peace Prize&ndash;sort of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Venezuelan opposition leader <a href="https://time.com/7343295/venezuela-machado-trump-nobel-peace-prize/" >Mar&iacute;a Corina Machado</a> presented President Donald Trump with the Nobel Peace Prize medal she was awarded in December, she told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. Machado said she made the presentation when she met with Trump for lunch at the White House earlier in the day.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;I presented the President of the United States the medal&mdash; the Nobel Peace Prize,&rdquo; Machado said. When she made the presentation, she said she told him a story of a similar medal with George Washington&rsquo;s face on it that General Marquis de Lafayette, the French military officer who helped win the American Revolution, had given Simon Bolivar, who helped liberate Venezuela and five other Latin American countries from Spanish rule. She said she called Trump, as the American President, the &ldquo;heir&rdquo; of Washington and told him: &ldquo;The people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal&mdash;in this case a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize and the recognition of his unique commitment to our freedom.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Trump has repeatedly said he deserves the award and his supporters have criticized Machado for accepting it. The day Machado won the award, she called Trump at the White House to tell him she was dedicating the prize to him. Machado told Fox News host Sean Hannity last week that she would like to tell him personally that the Venezuelan people &ldquo;want to give it to him and share it with him.&rdquo; Soon after, the Norwegian Nobel Institute released a statement asserting that its prizes &ldquo;cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Machado&rsquo;s main objective on Thursday was to impress upon Trump the importance of transitioning Venezuela from an autocracy to a government elected by Venezuelans that protected individual freedoms.</p>



<p>It may be an uphill climb. Since Trump ordered the arrest of the country&rsquo;s dictator Nicolas Maduro in a military raid on Jan. 3, he has signaled support for Maduro&rsquo;s ally Delcy Rodriguez as Venezuela&rsquo;s interim President, calling her &ldquo;terrific,&rdquo; while slighting Machado as not respected enough by Venezuelans to be their next leader. In the nearly two weeks since Maduro&rsquo;s ouster, Rodriguez&rsquo;s government has sent armed militias into the streets to <a href="https://time.com/7345598/venezuela-militias-violence-maduro-trump/" >search phones and arrest people </a>who expressed support for Maduro&rsquo;s capture.</p>



<p>Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio want what&rsquo;s left of Maduro&rsquo;s autocratic government to fulfill U.S. demands to control Venezuela&rsquo;s oil output and to stop drug smuggling.  He hasn&rsquo;t said publicly when he wants the current government to agree to allow free elections in the country. Maduro&rsquo;s government refused to step down in July 2024 when Maduro lost the country&rsquo;s presidential election. Machado&rsquo;s ally Edmundo Gonz&aacute;lez won that election after Machado was banned from the ballot.</p>



<p>As the high-stakes meeting was underway, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was &ldquo;looking forward&rdquo; to having &ldquo;a good and positive discussion.&rdquo; Leavitt praised Machado as &ldquo;a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people in&rdquo; Venezuela. </p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trump-davos.jpg" alt="TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-TRUMP"/>



<p>You would be forgiven for assuming that there are few places less hospitable to President Donald Trump than <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/" >Davos</a>, Switzerland&mdash;home to the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s annual meeting, the subject of this issue. The President gained popularity based on his ability to present himself as a foil to those who frequent Davos: for his antagonism toward expertise and the global elite, his distaste for norms and consensus-building, his pillorying of those who privilege causes like climate and international cooperation over economic self-interest. Yet Trump, whose <a href="https://time.com/7208371/trump-inauguration-2025-photos/" >Inauguration</a> took place during last year&rsquo;s meeting, is scheduled to appear in person this January at the conference for the first time since 2020. (If for some reason he does not attend, he will still undoubtedly be Topic A.)</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>It has been a very active year for Trump beyond <a href="https://time.com/7344540/trump-venezuela-maduro-sphere-of-influence/" >America&rsquo;s borders</a>, and the annual meeting provides us an opportunity to assess Year One of the <a href="https://time.com/7340573/donald-trump-timeline-first-year-second-term/" >second Trump Administration</a>. As <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7345543/trump-foreign-policy-second-term/" >Brian Bennett and Nik Popli write</a>, though the President campaigned on America First, his actions abroad may have caused the biggest waves. American Presidents regularly turn to foreign policy in their second term. Unburdened by a future reckoning with voters and perhaps wary of the domestic forces that can grind down a leader&rsquo;s ambitions, they seek out the chance to leave a legacy outside of the U.S. The American record in the past 12 months is mixed, but the results are being felt everywhere. To measure one consequence, Charlie Campbell <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339212/africa-zambia-copper-mining-critical-minerals-green-energy-transition" >traveled to Zambia</a> to explore how Africa is balancing mineral markets and the drawdown of U.S. foreign aid.</p>



<p>To the surprise of some, Trump has been an energetic actor on the world stage. The latest example: he began the New Year by <a href="https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/" >arresting the President of Venezuela</a> and promising to <a href="https://time.com/7345445/trump-venezuela-acting-president-wikipedia-truth-social/" >&ldquo;run&rdquo; the Latin American country</a>. Elsewhere, in 2025, he helped to <a href="https://time.com/7346197/iran-trump-protests-deaths/" >weaken an Iranian regime</a> that threatened its neighbors. In one of the two major conflicts that have dominated the world stage this decade, he architected a <a href="https://time.com/7327675/trump-israel-gaza-deal-interview/" >cease-fire</a>, with an eye toward ending major hostilities between <a href="https://time.com/7332324/gaza-plan-history/" >Israel and Hamas</a>. At the time of writing, he is trying to copy this approach to solve another intractable conflict, <a href="https://time.com/7342687/ukraine-russia-war-trump-zelensky-putin/" >Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine</a>. Ironically, some of the very sort of behaviors that rub the traditional Davos crowd the wrong way made these achievements possible.</p>

<p>Trump shows no signs of getting up from the global chessboard. One place he has been particularly involved is trade. In this issue, economist Robert Lawrence writes about <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339213/trump-tariffs-inflation-us-economy-global-trade-impact" >why the President&rsquo;s tariffs haven&rsquo;t yet tanked trade</a>, and Neale Mahoney, former special policy adviser in the White House National Economic Council, and Adam Shaw, an adviser at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, write about <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339214/global-affordability-crisis-cost-of-living-inflation-politics/" >why people around the world are facing an affordability squeeze</a>. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339218/ai-trade-global-economy-kristalina-georgieva-imf" >spoke to Justin Worland</a>, and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon spoke to Ayesha Javed about the <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339215/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-us-economy-ai-outlook-2026" >economic outlook for the year ahead</a>&mdash;one that cannot be considered without understanding the intentions of the White House. While we&rsquo;ve witnessed in the past year a new kind of international consensus emerging, which carries Trump&rsquo;s imprint, Ian Bremmer warns that <a href="https://time.com/7340453/trump-2026-look-ahead/" >2026 will test it</a>. &ldquo;This will be the year the bubble bursts on the President&rsquo;s vision of a Trump-dictated global trade and security order,&rdquo; he writes.</p>



<p>This year&rsquo;s meeting takes place under new leadership, and two of the forum&rsquo;s new leaders, <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7335477/world-economic-forum-president-borge-brende-geopolitics-growth-ai" >Borge Brende</a> and <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7345577/sustainable-growth-climate-collaboration" >Andr&eacute; Hoffmann</a>, discuss here how their organization is adapting to an era in which global consensus-forming is out and nationalism and populism are in. A key theme for them and everyone at Davos <a href="https://time.com/7346052/problem-ai-flattering-us/" >will be AI</a>. (Coming off our <a href="https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/" >Person of the Year</a> selection, it will be front and center for TIME in 2026 too.) Contributors to the issue, including TIME owner and Salesforce CEO <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339209/ai-revolution-agentic-enterprise" >Marc Benioff</a>, attorney <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339221/ai-justice-gap-womens-rights-legal" >Amal Clooney</a>, and investor <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339223/racial-wealth-gap-ai-economic-justice" >Robert F.

<p>Elsewhere, former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell, Rockefeller Foundation president Rajiv J. Shah, McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels, and WEF Young Global Leaders Angela Oduor Lungati and Hou Yifan <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339210/wef-young-leaders-ai-inclusion-jobs" >share solutions to problems</a> that they are focused on addressing.</p>



<p>Since 2018, we have partnered with the World Economic Forum to create our <a href="https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/" >Davos special issue</a>. This year&rsquo;s was edited by Ayesha Javed. Our hope is that it proves not only a useful guide for those in attendance but also a frame for seeing what will come in 2026.</p>

<p>On August 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India travelled to Tianjin, a city in eastern China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. His presence there, after five years of simmering India&ndash;China tensions, was widely read as signaling the possibility of a global geopolitical realignment. Modi&rsquo;s visit came in the wake of the United States imposing 25% tariffs on India, along with additional punitive duties linked to India&rsquo;s continued purchase of Russian oil. China, for its part, played up the SCO as a display of geopolitical confidence and an alternative pole of attraction.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>A rival spectacle unfolded in Washington. Over the past several months, a procession of world leaders has made the pilgrimage to placate President Donald Trump in the hope of securing favorable trade deals. Trump, in turn, has announced a flurry of agreements and investment promises with Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, and others. The spectacles in Tianjin and Washington dramatize a world in which major powers increasingly rely on public theatre, transactional bargains, and the symbolism of court-like diplomacy to project hierarchy and distribute favor. The tariff war Trump has unleashed has certainly produced a frenzy of activity.</p>



<p>But does it amount to a deeper geopolitical realignment?</p>



<p>President Trump&rsquo;s tariffs have certainly induced a different diplomatic orientation. States are behaving more opportunistically&mdash;bargaining issue by issue, extracting short-term relief, and avoiding long-term entanglements. If part of geopolitics once involved the creation and maintenance of global institutions, that ambition has all but vanished. The world now appears far more fluid.</p>



<p>As tariffs, export controls, and investment screening become normalized instruments of statecraft, countries are reordering their economic exposure: diversifying supply chains, seeking new export markets, relocating manufacturing, emphasizing self-reliance, and introducing currency-swap arrangements to make themselves less vulnerable to the fallout of an economic war between the United States and China. Modi&rsquo;s Tianjin outreach and the processions to Trump&rsquo;s court in Washington reflect this broader recalibration. States are seeking room to maneuver in a system where economic bargaining, rather than ideology or shared aspiration, shapes behavior.</p>



<p>Yet none of this amounts to a fundamental geopolitical realignment. Much of the drama is still best understood as crisis management within an existing hierarchical order. The choreography of hedging between Washington and Beijing, while simultaneously adjusting to American pressure, masks a deeper continuity. That continuity is anchored in two forces: the domestic constraints that limit the strategic choices of states, and the pre-existing security architectures that still bind them more tightly to the United States than to any emerging alternative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Maintaining American dominance</h3>



<p>A restructuring of the international trade order was inevitable. The liberal international order could be sustained only under two conditions: that it generated domestic economic outcomes that shored up the political legitimacy of global integration within major economies, and that the trading system produced broadly shared gains without fundamentally threatening American hegemony.</p>



<p>Both these conditions had been slowly eroding. The United States has worried about the loss of manufacturing and inequality since the 1990s. The causes of these phenomena are complex. In 2016, the economists David H. Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon H. Hanson popularized the phrase, &ldquo;China Shock,&rdquo; attributing a loss of about two million jobs to trade with China. Trade, rather than automation or other factors, became the major culprit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2227679941.jpg" alt="South Korean Civic Groups Hold Anti-U.S. Protests" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>This coincided with the recognition that under the existing system, American hegemony could be threatened. China had become a genuine competitor challenging American interests. The technology gap between America and China was narrowing, China was flexing power in the Asia-Pacific, and challenging America in international institutions.&nbsp; The liberal international order was no longer serving the purpose of American hegemony. Maintaining global American dominance needed new foundations.</p>



<p>The first Trump Administration began the process of repivoting the world order, and the Biden Administration continued in that direction. In October 2022, the Biden Administration unveiled the most expansive export control regime aimed at limiting China&rsquo;s access to advanced semiconductors. As Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor to President Joe Biden, put it, &ldquo;we previously maintained a sliding scale approach that said we need to stay only a couple of generations ahead. This is not the strategic environment in which we are today. Given the<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/seismic-shift-new-us-semiconductor-export-controls-and-implications-us-firms-allies-and"  target="_blank"> foundational nature</a> of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In theory, that American edge could be preserved by tightly focused restrictions on a small number of critical technologies (&ldquo;small yards and high fences&rdquo;) and close cooperation with allies. But it was already beginning to be uncertain what the scope and severity of those restrictions would be, and which allies would be considered useful. Therefore, Trump&rsquo;s tariffs were not some bizarre break from past policy but an inflection point in American approach to economic and technological competition.</p>



<p>Reorganizing global hierarchies to serve American power requires a new mix of instruments: trade as a tool to discipline adversaries and pressure allies; tariffs to protect industries, retain a technological edge, raise revenue, and secure critical resources; and sanctions to achieve political aims. The puzzle of why Washington punishes allies, or even potentially friendly states such as India or Brazil, is thus easily explained.</p>



<p>This is not a simple shift from free trade to mercantilism. It is a neo-imperial mercantilism that retains the fundamental aspiration of empire: ordering a hierarchy around American power. The emerging tariff regime represents the consolidation of a doctrine in which the weaponization of interdependence becomes the central technique of imperial management; the distinction between friends and adversaries matters less than their willingness to be folded into American objectives.</p>



<p>The United States isn&rsquo;t the only actor reshaping the global trading order. China, on the face of it, had every incentive to preserve the existing system: no country benefitted more from it. The multilateral trading framework also conveniently obscured China&rsquo;s own hegemonic ambitions under the procedural neutrality of its rules. China used the World Trade Organization to its advantage to gain access to world markets. But at the same time, its model of subsidies, forced technology transfers, developing country status and currency policies often gave it an advantage.</p>



<p>For the rest of the world, meanwhile, the system was a mixed bag: exports to China provided engines of growth; China became a major source of infrastructure finance; and the scale of its manufacturing base helped drive down the global costs of the energy transition. But the rest of the world also experienced its own version of the &ldquo;China Shock&rdquo; as Beijing&rsquo;s dominance in exports often came at the cost of other developing countries.<strong> </strong>This is in, part explains, why there has been little collective action to defend the old order.</p>



<p>Beijing reads the American turn toward imperial neo-mercantilism as a geopolitical gambit to contain China&rsquo;s rise. And Beijing is responding with clear geopolitical signaling: using tariffs for political purposes, weaponizing chokepoints in supply chains, whether rare earth minerals or critical manufacturing inputs, and granting or withdrawing market access. The premise that China would remain a status-quo power anchored in the old trading order is no longer tenable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An age of uncertainty</h3>



<p>China seems to be following a mixed strategy: a desire to signal resolve against the United States, preserve those parts of the order that continue to serve its interests, and reshape the rest through industrial policy, state-directed capital, supply-chain dominance, and economic partnerships to reflect its own preferences. China can be generous when it is costless, as with offering zero-tariff access to African exporters. But it also makes clear that it is fully capable of wielding tariffs, market access, and interdependence as instruments of political influence.</p>



<p>Is this new form of neo-imperial mercantilist competition likely to produce geopolitical realignment? Unless trade disputes in this time of economic nationalism spill over into outright war and hostility, a realignment is still a distant prospect for four reasons.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2233481108.jpg" alt="China Marks The 80th Anniversary Of The End Of World War II And Victory Over Japan" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>First, the extent to which global trade will actually be restructured remains uncertain.&nbsp; The tariff wars were driven partly by the perception that globalization had lost domestic legitimacy. Yet those very domestic constraints now limit how far states can shift toward neo-mercantilism. In the United States, concerns about inflation have already placed limits on how aggressively policymakers can wield tariffs as a weapon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China faces its own dilemma: its economy depends on exports, access to markets and customers.<strong> </strong>China already<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-manufacturing-surplus-costs-for-low-middle-income-countries-by-shoumitro-chatterjee-1-and-arvind-subramanian-2025-10"  target="_blank"> dominates</a> manufacturing across the board&mdash;from cheap textiles to advanced electronics. But, as economists Arvind Subramanian and Shoumitro Chatterjee point out, the challenges for other developing countries could intensify if China tries to compensate for slower domestic growth by increasing exports.<strong> </strong>So while developing countries welcome China, they are also wary of what Chinese overproduction might mean for them.</p>



<p>For most countries, the dominant strategy is not to realign or choose sides between the United States and China, but to treat both as indispensable economic poles, to extract concessions, and avoid the wrath of the two superpowers.</p>



<p>Second, geopolitical alignment continues to be driven by security and hard power. Even where countries desire greater autonomy, they remain constrained by existing security arrangements. States formally allied with the United States, or dependent on it for security guarantees, from Saudi Arabia to Japan, have far less room for maneuver than their diplomatic gestures imply. Their sovereign capacity to realign is circumscribed by the very architectures that protect them.</p>



<p>Europe is the classic case: reliant on the United States for security, yet dependent on China for trade and technology. Even India, which zealously guards its sovereignty, has moderated its Russian oil imports in response to Washington&#8217;s demands. But it will also remain more preoccupied with its security concerns over what the United States does over Pakistan.</p>



<p>Third, domestic political economies severely limit dramatic repositioning. Countries are deeply embedded in production networks, supply chains, financial systems, and technological ecosystems that cannot be reconfigured at will. Domestic coalitions, business interests, labor, commodity exporters, and technology sectors pull governments in contradictory directions. Leaders must respond to anxieties about vulnerability while preserving access to both China and the United States. The result is a characteristic ambivalence in much of the world: rhetorical assertions of realignment paired with limited room for meaningful action.</p>



<p>Fourth, no alternative structure exists that could absorb the geopolitical weight of a realignment. The United States may no longer be trusted. The prestige of its domestic institutions, once a pillar of American hegemony, has diminished. Yet China, for all its economic might, has not built a security architecture or normative order that other states trust. Its partnerships remain bilateral and transactional; its political and financial systems opaque; its ambitions ambiguous. Few states are willing to place their futures within a Chinese-led system. But this is also not a moment where the Global South can exercise collective leverage over either China or the United States.</p>



<p>The stubborn truth of this moment is this: Trump&rsquo;s tariff wars are generating uncertainty, pockets of economic dislocation, an erosion of trust in the United States, and a more difficult environment for the provision of global public goods. They are also amplifying the risks inherent in China&ndash;U.S. competition. States might feel more resentful but they continue to operate within a security and economic order they cannot meaningfully escape. This paradoxically makes the world more dangerous, since Trump thinks he can engage in price discovery without risking major geopolitical alignment. </p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s confidence that no country or coalition of countries is in a position to significantly push back, at least in the short run, is making him more overtly imperial in other domains as well.  Far from being isolationist or sticking to a sphere of influence, America is now firmly on an imperial trajectory: extracting a head of state from Venezuela, launching military operations in Syria and Nigeria, threatening Iran, and demanding Greenland. Chaos and uncertainty lie ahead. Major geopolitical realignment does not.</p>

<p>Sanae Takaichi made history just a few months ago by <a href="https://time.com/7327260/japan-prime-minister-sanae-takaichi-ldp-coalition-komeito-ishin-analysis/" >becoming Japan&rsquo;s first female Prime Minister</a>, after her <a href="https://time.com/7315284/shigeru-ishiba-japan-prime-minister-resignation-ldp-future-analysis-explainer/" >predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, resigned</a> as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and she was voted by the party to take his place.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>But now she&rsquo;s on the verge of risking it all.</p>



<p>Takaichi <a href="https://jen.jiji.com/jc/i?g=eco&amp;k=2026011401129"  target="_blank">told senior officials</a> from the LDP and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, that she intended to dissolve the House of Representatives&mdash;Japan&rsquo;s legislative lower but more powerful chamber&mdash;to call a snap general election.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a gamble to reassert her authority amid years of the LDP slumping in the polls and political power. The goal, LDP secretary-general Shunichi Suzuki <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA14AEN0U6A110C2000000/"  target="_blank">told reporters</a>, is to &ldquo;at the very least secure a majority&rdquo; of seats in the 465-member chamber, which the LDP-led coalition just barely holds at 233 thanks to an unsuccessful similar gambit by Ishiba in 2024. The LDP also lost the upper house in 2025 polls, as voters appeared to punish the long-ruling party over <a href="https://time.com/6900134/japan-ldp-scandals-public-approval-kishida/" >a series of scandals and its subsequent failure to reform</a>, giving rise to <a href="https://time.com/7306873/japan-elections-japanese-first-sanseito-sohei-kamiya-trump-far-right/" >fringe parties</a> that further throw the LDP&rsquo;s future electoral victories into uncertainty.</p>



<p>Japan isn&rsquo;t due for another general election until October 2028, but Suzuki said Takaichi wants to dissolve the lower chamber &ldquo;soon&rdquo; after the legislative session begins on Jan. 23. Some within Takaichi&rsquo;s party question the timing. Japanese news outlet <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/behind-takaichi-s-decision-to-call-a-snap-japan-election"  target="_blank">Nikkei</a> reported that the leader had not informed even high-ranking LDP members about her decision to call an election early and that &ldquo;cautious voices&rdquo; believed the new government needed to put in more work first and later campaign on that. The opposition, meanwhile, has argued that Takaichi&rsquo;s snap election plan risks delaying the passage of Japan&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 budget as well as the implementation of new price relief measures, when she promised to address rising prices.</p>



<p>Takaichi is expected to officially announce next Monday the details and justification for calling an early election, but opposition parties are already preparing to thwart her. The main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/japan-election/japan-opposition-groups-to-form-new-party-to-fight-snap-election"  target="_blank">is reportedly</a> teaming up with Komeito, which used to be part of the LDP coalition but broke off after the far-right Takaichi became LDP leader.</p>



<p>But experts say that Takaichi is betting on strong public approval for political preservation: to assert that she is a leader who could be in power for years and move away from Japan&rsquo;s revolving-door politics. Takaichi is the fourth Prime Minister the LDP has cycled through since Shinzo Abe, who led since late 2012, <a href="https://time.com/5884387/shinzo-abe-resigns/" >stepped down</a> in September 2020.</p>



<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s hoping to rekindle that magic of the Abe era when the LDP ruled supreme,&rdquo; Jeff Kingston, professor of Asian studies at Temple University&rsquo;s Japan Campus, tells TIME.</p>



<p>To be sure, in her first few months, Takaichi has made quite an impression on the world stage, <a href="https://time.com/7328829/sanae-takaichi-donald-trump-japan-us-trade-defense-ishiba-abe/" >befriending U.S. President Donald Trump</a> while <a href="https://time.com/7334371/china-japan-taiwan-takaichi-explainer/" >earning the ire of China</a>&mdash;moves that have earned her praise and <a href="https://www.nippon.com/ja/japan-data/h30018/"  target="_blank">consistently high approval ratings</a> at home.</p>



<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been very good at the optics of leadership, about managing the media, about creating a political spectacle that draws positive media attention,&rdquo; Kingston says, &ldquo;but she hasn&rsquo;t actually delivered anything substantial.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s seen as hardworking, relatable, honest, committed to the country, and having stood up to China&rsquo;s disinformation campaign and economic coercion,&rdquo; says Stephen Nagy, a professor of international relations at the International Christian University in Tokyo and a visiting fellow with the Japan Institute for International Affairs.</p>



<p>But Takaichi still &ldquo;needs to pursue a positive agenda to strengthen her mandate at home,&rdquo; Nagy adds, noting that a decisive electoral victory would not only help her to pass her <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2025/10/takaichis-ambitious-economic-and-security-agenda-for-japan/"  target="_blank">ambitious economic agenda</a> but would also likely bolster her image among international partners like the U.S.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Her approval ratings are sky high, and they&rsquo;re only going to decline,&rdquo; says Kingston, who notes her popularity has yet to factor in the yen&rsquo;s tumble and rising interest rates caused by her expansionary fiscal policies, which could stoke inflation and exacerbate the country&rsquo;s cost-of-living crisis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to get any better than this for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Trump Administration secured its first sale of Venezuelan oil since its aggressive military operation in the South American country that led to the <a href="https://time.com/7342864/venezuela-caracas-strikes-trump/" >capture</a> of the nation&rsquo;s president, Nicol&aacute;s Maduro.</p>



<p>The sale, confirmed to TIME by a Trump Administration official, is valued at $500 million. The official added that more sales are expected to be finalized in the coming days and weeks.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>&ldquo;President Trump brokered a historic energy deal with Venezuela, immediately following the arrest of narcoterrorist Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, that will benefit the American and Venezuelan people,&rdquo; White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to TIME.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;President Trump&rsquo;s team is facilitating positive, ongoing discussions with oil companies that are ready and willing to make unprecedented investments to restore Venezuela&rsquo;s oil infrastructure,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;President Trump is protecting our Western Hemisphere from being taken advantage of by narcoterrorists, drug traffickers, and foreign adversaries.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Details of the sale were first reported by <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/14/2026/us-gets-first-500-million-venezuelan-oil-deal-holding-some-proceeds-in-qatar"  target="_blank">Semafor</a>. The news outlet also reported that revenue from the deal is being kept in bank accounts controlled by the U.S. government, including one based in Qatar.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of Maduro&rsquo;s capture, Trump said that the U.S. would <a href="https://time.com/7342937/venezuela-trump-maduro-oil/?itm_source=parsely-api" >&ldquo;run the country&rdquo;</a> until a &ldquo;proper and judicious transition&rdquo; of power took place. He indicated that the U.S. would <a href="https://time.com/7343783/oil-companies-response-trump-venezuela/" >take control of the oil industry</a> in the South American nation. Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the U.S. plans to seize and sell <a href="https://time.com/7344479/venezuela-oil-rubio-trump/" >up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil</a>, the funds from which would be disbursed, by the U.S. government, &ldquo;in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,&rdquo; the President said earlier this month.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255676591.jpg" alt="Trump Reasserts Greenland Claim As Diplomats Arrive In US"/>



<p>Denmark&rsquo;s foreign minister said on Wednesday that a &ldquo;fundamental disagreement&rdquo; with U.S. President Donald Trump over the future of Greenland remained unresolved after high-level talks in Washington, even as Denmark and NATO allies moved to increase their military presence in the Arctic territory amid rising tensions.</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Speaking at a press conference after meeting with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Denmark&rsquo;s foreign minister Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen described the discussions as &ldquo;frank but also constructive,&rdquo; but made clear that Denmark and Greenland firmly reject the Trump Administration&rsquo;s continued efforts to control the semiautonomous island.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The President has made his view clear, and we have a different position,&rdquo; Rasmussen said. &ldquo;Ideas that would not respect the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark and the right of self-determination of the Greenlandic people are totally unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The high-profile meeting came as Denmark and its NATO partners are taking visible steps to reinforce their presence in Greenland. In Copenhagen, Denmark&rsquo;s defense minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, announced that Denmark would increase military activity in and around Greenland, citing an increasingly unpredictable security environment. Rasmussen told reporters in Washington that Denmark was reinforcing security in the Arctic &ldquo;by committing additional funds for military capabilities&mdash;not dogsleds, but ships, drones, fighter jets, etc.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Several European NATO allies confirmed that they were also sending personnel to the island. Sweden&rsquo;s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said that officers from the Swedish Armed Forces had arrived in Greenland to prepare for activities connected to a Danish military exercise, Operation Arctic Endurance. Norway said it would send two military personnel to explore further cooperation with allies.</p>



<p>Germany&rsquo;s Defense Ministry said it was dispatching a reconnaissance team of 13 military personnel to Greenland for an exploration mission from January 15 to 17. The goal, the ministry said, was to assess possible contributions to regional security, including maritime surveillance.</p>



<p>The moves underscore growing concern in Europe that Trump&rsquo;s rhetoric risks destabilizing relations within NATO.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are definitely ready to do more,&rdquo; Rasmussen added.</p>



<p>Rasmussen was joined in the discussions with the White House by Greenland&rsquo;s foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt, who said that while Greenland was open to strengthening cooperation with the United States on security, that did not mean it was interested in being owned by Washington.</p>



<p>&ldquo;We have shown where our limits are,&rdquo; Motzfeldt said. &ldquo;It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to find the right path&mdash;but that path does not include ownership.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The meeting in Washington was requested by officials from Greenland and Denmark amid an escalating dispute fueled by Trump&rsquo;s repeated insistence that the United States must acquire Greenland &ldquo;one way or another&rdquo; for national security reasons. Greenland is a semiautonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, which retains responsibility for the island&rsquo;s defense and foreign policy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255656501.jpg" alt="US-DENMARK-GREENLAND-POLITICS-DIPLOMACY" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>In recent days, Trump has argued that NATO should support a U.S. takeover of the island, warning that anything short of American control would leave Greenland vulnerable to China or Russia.</p>



<p>&ldquo;NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the United States,&rdquo; Trump wrote on social media hours before the talks. &ldquo;<a href="https://time.com/7346104/trump-greenland-annexation-threat-us-control/" >Anything less than that is unacceptable</a>.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/7346324/greenland-trump-polls-annexation-denmark/" >Americans Don&rsquo;t Want Greenland. Trump Is Convinced He Can Change That</a></em></p>



<p>Denmark and Greenland, both part of the NATO alliance, strongly dispute that claim. &ldquo;According to our intelligence, we haven&#8217;t had a Chinese warship in Greenland for a decade or so,&rdquo; Rasmussen said at the press conference. &ldquo;There is not an instant threat from China or Russia that we cannot accommodate.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Rasmussen said Denmark believed Greenland&rsquo;s long-term security could be ensured &ldquo;inside the current framework,&rdquo; noting that the United States already maintains a military presence on the island under a 1951 defense agreement that allows Washington to establish and expand bases with the consent of Danish and Greenlandic authorities.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The U.S. has already wide military access to Greenland,&rdquo; Rasmussen said. &ldquo;We wish to hear if the U.S. had any further request to make in this aspect. We would examine any such request constructively.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Despite the sharp disagreement, the two sides agreed to establish a high-level working group to explore whether some of Trump&rsquo;s stated security concerns could be addressed without crossing what Denmark calls its &ldquo;red lines.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The group, in our view, should focus on how to address the American security concerns, while at the same time respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark,&rdquo; Rasmussen said. The group is expected to hold its first meeting within weeks.</p>



<p>Asked about his suggestion to acquire Greenland by force, Trump told reporters on Wednesday, &ldquo;I never said that.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rely on Denmark being able to fend themselves off,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;They were talking about they would put an extra dog&#8211;and they were serious about this&#8211; they put an extra dog sled there last month, they added a second dog sled. That&rsquo;s not going to do the trick.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Greenland&rsquo;s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, <a href="https://time.com/7345949/greenland-denmark-trump/" >said on Tuesday</a> that if Greenland were forced to choose, &ldquo;we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.&rdquo; Trump responded by saying he did not know Nielsen and that his position would be &ldquo;a big problem for him.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Greenland&rsquo;s strategic importance has increased as climate change melts Arctic ice, opening shorter shipping routes to Asia and raising interest in the island&rsquo;s untapped reserves of critical minerals used in advanced technologies. Trump has also described Greenland as vital to his proposed &ldquo;Golden Dome&rdquo; missile defense system.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255541531.jpg" alt="Winter-Winds-Batter-Gaza-Tent-Shelters"/>



<p>The U.S. announced the launch of &ldquo;Phase Two&rdquo; of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://time.com/7327675/trump-israel-gaza-deal-interview/" >Gaza cease-fire plan </a>on Wednesday, officially embarking on the &ldquo;demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction&rdquo; of the territory.</p>



<p>Trump&rsquo;s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff <a href="https://x.com/SEPeaceMissions/status/2011478211075391845"  target="_blank">confirmed</a> a Palestinian Administration titled the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) will be established to oversee the rebuilding efforts. Wifkoff also emphasized that the U.S. &ldquo;expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations&rdquo; and called for the militant group to release the body of Ran Gvili, the final deceased hostage. He warned a lack of compliance would bring &ldquo;serious consequences.&rdquo;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Witkoff did not offer further information as to who would be on the committee and what the reconstruction of Gaza might look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The White House did not immediately respond to TIME&rsquo;s request for further information.</p>



<p>Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, the mediators of the cease-fire deal, in a joint <a href="https://mofa.gov.qa/en/latest-articles/statements/joint-statement-from-the-mediators-on-the-formation-of-the-palestinian-technocratic-committee-to-administer-the-gaza-strip"  target="_blank">statement</a> shared after Witkoff&rsquo;s update, announced that the committee will be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority. The countries expressed hope that this next phase of the deal will bring &ldquo;security, stability, and a dignified life&rdquo; for the Palestinian people.</p>



<p>Hussein Al-Sheikh, the vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization, also welcomed news of the progress in Gaza.</p>



<p>Al-Sheikh <a href="https://x.com/HusseinSheikhpl/status/2011445660499775945"  target="_blank">stated</a> the importance of not creating any arrangements that might cause further division, while highlighting the need for local figures to work with the United States &ldquo;and relevant partners to take decisive steps in the West Bank in parallel with the transitional phase in Gaza.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Phase One of the cease-fire deal faced a number of challenges. Hamas, which has ruled over Gaza for 18 years and has yet to disarm, did not return the remains of the final <a href="https://time.com/7283392/tal-shoham-freed-hamas-hostage-gaza-essay/" >hostage</a>. The Israeli airstrikes that have taken place since the cease-fire came into effect in October have also halted progress.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s understood that throughout Phase Two, the committee will handle the day-to-day items in Gaza and will be overseen by the Trump-led &ldquo;Gaza Board of Peace.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The members of the board have yet to be confirmed. Reports have named various high-profile figures&mdash;such as former United Nations Middle East envoy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/world/middleeast/gaza-palestinian-committee.html"  target="_blank">Nickolay Mladenov</a>, and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair&mdash;as potential committee members. There have also been multiple reports that the current U.K. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer&mdash;who has<a href="https://time.com/7318214/trump-starmer-us-uk-tech-prosperity-deal-signed/" > cultivated a strong, working relationship with Trump</a>&mdash;has been asked to serve on the board.</p>



<p>TIME has been told that conversations regarding the make-up of the board are ongoing, but Starmer has yet to receive a formal invite.</p>



<p>According to Reuters, an announcement regarding the Board of Peace is set to be made at DAVOS next week.</p>

<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-7346197"></div></div>

<img decoding="async" class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-featured-media" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iran-protests-001.jpg" alt="Protests Against The Regime In Iran"/>



<p>Despite an almost total communications blackout, a small number of Iranians have managed to send messages out of the country. They describe <a href="https://time.com/7345347/iran-protests-death-toll-estimate-thousands/" >mounting civilian deaths</a> and streets awash with blood&mdash;and say many protesters are pinning their hopes on President Donald Trump following through on his threats against Iran&rsquo;s rulers.</p>



<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing they&rsquo;re thinking about,&rdquo; said a resident of Tehran&rsquo;s Marzdaran neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>
[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]




<p>Another resident, from the capital&rsquo;s affluent Niavaran district, said protesters see <a href="https://time.com/7345744/trump-iran-protesters-strike-explainer/" >outside intervention</a> as their only remaining option. &ldquo;People know they won&#8217;t be able to beat them without help,&rdquo; they said.</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7345555/iran-protests-deaths-us-trump-israel/" ><em>What&rsquo;s Happening in Iran Right Now, Explained</em></a></p>



<p>Only days ago, city streets were crowded with demonstrators chanting for the downfall of the government. Now, according to residents and phone footage that has circulated online, those same streets are patrolled by trucks mounted with heavy machine guns.</p>



<p>&ldquo;If Uncle doesn&#8217;t do something it&#8217;s over. They will just go on killing people until no one&rsquo;s left,&rdquo; the Niavaran district resident said, referring to Trump as &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; out of fear that Iranian intelligence might somehow be monitoring Starlink, the satellite internet system that circumvents the state&rsquo;s blackout.</p>



<p>Trump, meanwhile, continues to raise hopes. &ldquo;Help is on its way,&rdquo; the President wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday, in the most explicit promise of intervention since Jan. 2., when he first warned Iran&rsquo;s authorities against attacking Iranians. &ldquo;Keep protesting &#8211; take over your institutions,&rdquo; he said, adding that those responsible would &ldquo;pay a big price.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The post was reported on Persian-language satellite news channels, which have remained available despite the internet blackout. &ldquo;Literally 9 or 10 people called, and said, &lsquo;Good news&mdash;Trump said help is on the way,&rdquo; said a man who had traveled out of Iran on Wednesday.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Everyone is waiting for an attack, an attack that will weaken the suppression system,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If that happens the whole country will go back on the streets.&rdquo;</p>



<p>He described a capital where consumer goods had grown scarce&mdash;it took two hours to find eggs&mdash;and residents had been instructed to be indoors by 4 p.m. &ldquo;The city looks frightening. After 3 or 4 pm, it&#8217;s deserted.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://time.com/7345744/trump-iran-protesters-strike-explainer/" ><em>Will the U.S. Strike Iran? The Factors Shaping Trump&rsquo;s Decision</em></a></p>



<p>Iranians say the massive loss of life&mdash;which estimates suggest is more than 10,000 killed&mdash;has kept many indoors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Fear is back,&rdquo; said a resident of Yasuj, a city in southwestern Iran. &ldquo;On Thursday night they started shooting into the crowds. I saw someone shot right in front of me.&rdquo; A resident of Tehran&rsquo;s Yusefabad district said Monday that the streets were more empty now. &ldquo;Most people are afraid to go out any more.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The crackdown, they say, is being carried out primarily by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij militia&mdash;forces that have crushed protests for decades. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re standing at every junction,&rdquo; said one woman from the capital&#8217;s Yusefabad district. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s martial law. They&rsquo;re shooting in the air just to remind everyone they&rsquo;re in control of the streets.&rdquo; </p>



<p>The Guards and the Basij began replacing the regular police and its specialised anti-riot units from Jan. 8. It is not clear if the replacement was due to the inability of the police to suppress the protests, or reports of defections. In one instance a video emerged from the western city of Abdanan, where the local police were no longer on the streets, but rather standing on the roof of their station and waving at the massive crowds of protestors.</p>



<p>In Yasuj, the resident said police units vanished from the streets after reports of defections. &ldquo;But they were all arrested, the police have practically withdrawn from the streets,&rdquo; he said. There have been no eyewitness accounts of police patrols in Iranian cities in recent days.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Everyone is so restless, so hopeless,&rdquo; said the man in Marzdaran, a neighborhood in northwest Tehran. The bodies in the street are not strangers, he added.  &ldquo;Many people have lost a relative, or a close friend. They are just killing, killing, killing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The accounts are supported by footage of security forces shooting assault rifles into crowds, bursts from truck-mounted heavy machine guns in residential streets, and bodies lined up by the hundreds at a morgue.<strong> </strong>&ldquo;In Nourabad and Dehdasht&hellip; they are still killing&rdquo;, the resident of Yasuj said, naming nearby smaller cities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255209397.jpg" alt="Protests in Iran January 2026" alignment="center"/><p class="article_header"></p><p class="article_subheading"></p><p class="article_text"></p></figure>



<p>The communications blackout has deepened the sense of isolation. Iranian authorities have shut down the internet during past protests, but this time they also cut off cell phone networks, SMS messaging, and landlines&mdash;severing Iranians not only from the outside world, but from one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;If people in different cities could hear what others are doing, they might be able to get heart from each other,&rdquo; said the Yasuj resident. &ldquo;But now they just feel they are all alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starlink remains the sole breach in the internet blackout. Though illegal in Iran, the satellite dishes were <a href="https://time.com/6249365/iran-elon-musk-starlink-protests/" >smuggled</a> in during the last major protests. Today, tens of thousands are operating across the country, often extending Wi-Fi signals across entire buildings or neighborhoods while concealing the origin of the signal. Several activists confirmed Tuesday that Starlink, owned by Elon Musk, has suspended subscription fees and updated its software to evade jamming.</p>



<p>Those managing to send messages abroad may not represent all Iranians. Before the recent violence, polls suggested the regime could rely on the support of only about 20 percent of the population. Yet Iran is also deeply nationalistic, and even among the remaining 80 percent, support for foreign military intervention has historically been uncertain. That hesitation was visible last June, during Israel&rsquo;s so-called 12-day war with Iran&mdash;while the strikes targeted military and nuclear sites, they also killed hundreds of civilians, triggering backlash and unease.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s different this time,&rdquo; the resident of Yasuj maintained. &ldquo;It&#8217;s a one-sided war against a bloodthirsty regime. Many have set their hopes on Trump. And it&rsquo;s understandable. If something, somehow doesn&#8217;t happen&#8230; it&#8217;ll be a catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
