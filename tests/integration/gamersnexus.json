These are our favorite pieces to run annually and help you quickly get back into PC components if you haven’t been paying attention, but also give us a reason to go back through all the cases we’ve tested recently and remember what was the best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are meant to be more of a fly-over story in the round-up series to help simplify and highlight the key points. If you want the full in-depth reviews with all the nuance, check the links in the description below. We’ve linked each case review and have also provided all the usual affiliate links with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already published <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/best-cpus-2024-intel-vs-amd-gaming-production-budget-efficiency\">Best CPUs</a> and the same thing applies here: Sometimes, the best case or CPU in 2024 might be something that launched in a previous year. We look at the total market and what the best options are now, not just what launched this year. As a reminder as well, we took about a year off of case reviews in 2023, so we launched back into it heavy this year and we’re excited to be back to the Best Of series for something positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"overview-best-pc-cases-2024\"><strong>Overview: Best PC Cases for 2024</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>Category</td><td>Case</td><td>Review</td></tr><tr><td>Best Overall Case 2024</td><td>Fractal North<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-North-Slate-Gray/dp/B09V878FXQ?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"> Amazon</a><br />on<a href=\"https://howl.link/0n35xllzt9puf\"> Newegg</a><br /><br />Fractal North XL<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-North-Charcoal-Black/dp/B0CJCJ3ZZB?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"> Amazon</a><br />on<a href=\"https://howl.link/lrnpapmphtbqg\"> Newegg</a></td><td><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aor-3v6N7i8\">Excellent Design: Fractal North Case Review & Benchmarks</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/fractal-north-xl-case-review-benchmarks-wood-panels-mesh\">Fractal North XL Case Review & Benchmarks: Wood Panels & Mesh</a></td></tr><tr><td>Best Mechanical Design</td><td>HAVN HS 420<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HAVN-Dual-Chamber-Radiator-SimpliCable-Management/dp/B0DDCMHXW1\"> Amazon</a></td><td><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/new-type-computer-case-havn-hs-420-thermal-benchmarks-review\">A New Type of Computer Case | HAVN HS 420 Thermal Benchmarks & Review</a></td></tr><tr><td>Best Sub-$100 Case</td><td>Lian Li Lancool 207<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-Optimized-Pre-Installed-Tempered/dp/B0DHXWYK4J?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"> Amazon</a><br />on<a href=\"https://howl.link/0afr2uvggpxh7\"> Newegg</a></td><td><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/lian-li-lancool-207-airflow-case-review-cable-management-build-quality-benchmarks\">Lian Li Lancool 207 Airflow Case Review | Cable Management, Build Quality, & Benchmarks</a></td></tr><tr><td>Best Mid-Range Case</td><td>Antec C8 ARGB<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-C8-ARGB-Dual-Chamber-Compatible/dp/B0CT2LSSHK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"> Amazon</a><br />on<a href=\"https://howl.link/ia4a8mz0qlu1p\"> Newegg</a></td><td><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/surprisingly-good-antec-c8-argb-case-review-thermals-cable-management-noise\">Surprisingly Good: Antec C8 ARGB Case Review, Thermals, Cable Management, & Noise</a></td></tr><tr><td>Best Out-of-the-Box Case Thermals</td><td>Lian Li Lancool 207<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-Optimized-Pre-Installed-Tempered/dp/B0DHXWYK4J?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"> Amazon</a><br />on<a href=\"https://howl.link/0afr2uvggpxh7\"> Newegg</a><br /><br />Antec Flux Pro<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"> Amazon</a><br />on<a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\"> Newegg</a></td><td><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/lian-li-lancool-207-airflow-case-review-cable-management-build-quality-benchmarks\">Lian Li Lancool 207 Airflow Case Review | Cable Management, Build Quality, & Benchmarks</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/best-case-2024-so-far-antec-flux-pro-review-benchmarks\">Best Case of 2024 So Far: Antec Flux Pro Review & Benchmarks</a></td></tr><tr><td>Best Noise-Normalized Case Thermals</td><td>Antec Flux Pro<br />on<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"> Amazon</a><br />on<a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\"> Newegg</a></td><td><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/best-case-2024-so-far-antec-flux-pro-review-benchmarks\">Best Case of 2024 So Far: Antec Flux Pro Review & Benchmarks</a></td></tr><tr><td>Most Innovative Case</td><td>Meshless AIO</td><td><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/better-computer-fan-sometimes-cross-flow-meshless-aio-case-benchmarks-review\">A Better Computer Fan -

Although other cases are superior in some individual situations, like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\">Antec Flux Pro</a> (by a slim margin) in thermals or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HAVN-Dual-Chamber-Radiator-SimpliCable-Management/dp/B0DDCMHXW1\">HAVN HS 420</a> in mechanical aspects, the <a href=\"https://howl.link/0n35xllzt9puf\">North</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/lrnpapmphtbqg\">North XL</a> are masterful executions of a standard computer case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is bolstered by prices that have been lower in recent weeks, typically down around $125 to $140 for the North (watch our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aor-3v6N7i8\">review</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fractal North was the first case to successfully kick-off the wooden trend at scale, with everyone else in the industry scrambling to follow. InWin gets credit for initially attempting this years ago, but it failed to find a way to bring it to market and execute. Fractal pulled it all together and cleaned up the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-14h57m39s102.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5060\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-14h57m39s102.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-14h57m39s102.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5060\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3f7d1a96-669f-49ba-b816-cb7be75b66b1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m25s838.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5061\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m25s838.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m25s838.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5061\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6badad88-6062-479f-a888-eec235c846a9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The North comes with either a glass or mesh side panel, which includes options for additional side mounts to further boost cooling performance. Actually, in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYqeI3Om1ew\">recent tour of Wendell’s offices</a>, you can see such a configuration for one of his machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fractal’s fan support on the XL is also effectively whatever you want it to be: The company cleverly uses standard hole spacing for its rear ventilation (and even PCIe slot covers and top of the power supply shroud) so that you could mount a fan basically anywhere you want in the case. The cooling options are really opened up because of this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ease-of-installation options are also great: Because the top panel so easily slides off to remove, and because Fractal doesn’t put a ton of other metal in the way, you can get clear access through the top of the case for builds. The extra width in the XL also makes larger radiators easier to work with up top, reducing board clearance issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m48s222.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5140\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m48s222.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m48s222.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5140\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ad3a22bd-cd7f-4625-8ac6-1dbfab86641b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m51s293.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5139\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m51s293.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m51s293.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5139\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"355f6745-3776-4ae9-a746-6a6e1957f889\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The North XL (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/fractal-north-xl-case-review-benchmarks-wood-panels-mesh\">our review</a>) is what we prefer to the North, mostly for its increased size for easier building and for our style of build, but both are good takes on the theme. Visually, the wood look doesn’t look like the slapped-on Vinyl style we see in other cases. It looks more purposeful. Fractal also does great work mixing different tone wood coloring with different panel coloring, including matching the black case with gold accents and the white case with silver accents.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m55s654.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5062\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"86439380-10fe-4786-8e30-306cee2e792d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>And finally, even in cooling performance, the North XL is routinely at the top of the charts for thermal benchmarks. It’s not the best -- that’ll go to two other cases this year -- but it’s regularly at the top, and that plus all the other features, plus the value, get the North cases the Best Overall

href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HAVN-Dual-Chamber-Radiator-SimpliCable-Management/dp/B0DDCMHXW1\">HS 420</a>. The HS 420 (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/new-type-computer-case-havn-hs-420-thermal-benchmarks-review\">review</a>) exhibits a mastery of mechanical features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HS 420 doesn't include fans, it's not fully airflow-focused, and it isn't cheap at $200 for the horizontal GPU model. That makes it a tough fit for our price- and performance-focused award categories, but it needs to be recognized, because it's one of the most interesting and downright good cases that we've reviewed this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, it’s excellent. The curved tempered glass panel is the most significant feature. The panel is installed by sliding it back and down into the case on plastic wheels, where it then comes to rest on the bottom edge of the chassis. It takes some getting used to, but it's a clever and secure way of getting the huge glass pane seated. It's also proven to be durable, surviving multiple build/unbuild cycles through the filming process without serious wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a lot of thought put into airflow, something we illustrated in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2RytD3xII-0?t=404\">animations</a>. The HS 420 VGPU includes a curved glass deflector that's intended to direct incoming air around and into vertically-mounted GPUs. It was a clever idea and a fresh approach, which we appreciated, but it did not help performance in our test system. That’s also why we're specifically giving the award to the $200 base model, which is cheaper and sheds the hardware that didn’t do much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the base model, though, HAVN planned for an unusual airflow pattern with intake at the bottom of the rear panel and exhaust at the top of the same panel, and included 120mm plates on each mount that are isolated with rubber vibration damping. In fact, every fan tray is padded with rubber, including the side mount that doubles as drive storage. The drive storage alone is pretty cool. It creates a spine-like structure that can be removed for more fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case's construction is clever and precise in areas like the tightly-spaced storage bays at the front and the rounded edges of the PSU shroud and motherboard tray. The simple GPU support that ships with the non-VGPU case variant is one of the sturdiest we've seen, cast from solid metal and braced against the PSU shroud. The cable channels are not only labeled, but color-coded in what is an excellent feature, as it helps new builders understand where to route cables.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h06m22s188.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5074\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3c73e8dd-7b8b-4e44-99d5-32fa72349fcf\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>There are a ton of other small attention-to-detail elements, like the fact that HAVN matched the structural reinforcement for the panels to align with fan hubs, or the dead zone, rather than obstructing air intake.

The ALTA D1 is an $800 halo product that's finally hit retail following our first encounter with it at Computex 2023 and again at Computex 2024. The price is ridiculous and very few people will buy the case, but the mechanical design hopefully inspires some more affordable cases: It has modular bays on rails everywhere, including 5.25\" drive support, socketable radiators, a slide-out motherboard tray, SSI-EEB support, 11 expansion slots, large fan mounts, repositionable power supplies, and a true home server setup.

In the current market, $80 is dirt cheap for a name-brand case: there are cheaper cases available from companies like SAMA and DIYPC, but we're confident that none of them come close to the Lancool 207's frequently chart-topping thermal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h09m02s907.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5091\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"32ebf9a7-ab8d-49bb-811e-cde9e8301b68\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>When we <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/68-case-4-fans-silverstone-515xr-100-514x-case-reviews\">reviewed</a> the SilverStone 515XR, we were aware that SilverStone had pulled out all the stops to offer a case with four fans at $68, but the performance gap between it and the 207 is massive. There’s also differences in quality-of-life features. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h09m05s635.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5092\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d1af546a-3bcb-4d70-8353-a31f704e97ed\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The same goes for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/eorapgqyn4u0c\">Phanteks XT Pro Ultra</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mid-Tower-Pre-Installed-Full-View-Wood-Grain-Interface/dp/B0D5PQTCS9?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Montech XR</a>. Both cases have been added to our charts recently. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/vsucpvvlku612\">Montech XR</a> is supposed to be closer to $60, but has been out of stock lately and often more expensive when it is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-Optimized-Pre-Installed-Tempered/dp/B0DHXWYK4J?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Lancool 207</a> is a solidly-built case with sturdy toolless panels, which is unusual at this price point. The most unusual aspect, though, is at the bottom of the case, where two 120mm intake fans are positioned directly underneath the GPU, while the PSU is mounted at the front with an extension cord. The shroud is ventilated on both sides as well as the rear in order to provide an airflow path for the bottom intake fans (although adding drives and cables to the case reduces that ventilation, but the ample intake through the rear counters this). In addition to the two bottom intake fans, 2x 140mm ARGB front intake fans are included with the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They may not sound significant individually, but the fact that the 207 has a full suite of basic quality of life features like reusable (and bridgeless) expansion slot covers, rubber grommets for cable cutouts, a USB Type-C port, ARGB fans, built-in velcro straps, and toolless panels is impressive in combination with its price and thermal performance. It's rare to see that full combo in a case, especially one which is also a top thermal performer. The fact that the 207 also wins our objective, numbers-based Best Thermals category is also part of why it lands here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have two big issues with the 207: first, the toolless side panel won't stay on without meticulous cable management. There's no way around this, but sticking to flat cables and minimizing the number of cables used will help. There's also room to improve PSU cooling in the case, as most PSUs will be oriented fan-side-down with barely any clearance above the table surface. The cable management is the one to be aware of. You can watch our review for more on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, at $80, Lian Li is being brutally competitive.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

We’re looking for something that isn’t too wild or out there. We want relatively standard, but a good price-to-performance and overall build quality. We’re also looking for something a little bit better than the budget case. For this, we’re giving it to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-C8-ARGB-Dual-Chamber-Compatible/dp/B0CT2LSSHK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Antec C8 ARGB</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antec has had a strong year. It had 2 showings this year in our list we have today, but it was the <a href=\"https://howl.link/ew6eo2gp9acas\">Antec C8</a> that first signaled to us that the company was worth paying attention to again after a decade of fading into irrelevance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $150 for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/ia4a8mz0qlu1p\">ARGB variant</a> with fans included, but it's been long enough since the case's June launch that we're beginning to see discounts. The fan-less variant is regularly available with promo codes around $100. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mid-range award category gives us some room to consider quality of life and aesthetic features, not just raw performance-per-dollar, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-C8-ARGB-Dual-Chamber-Compatible/dp/B0CT2LSSHK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">C8</a> is well-balanced in those categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The C8's dual chamber layout isn’t new, but Antec impressed us with the level of care that it put into details like molding text into the fan frames, color-matching all the components in the white SKU, and the accessory kit. Small touches, even ones that aren't functional, add up to create a product that feels worth the price. The C8's appearance reminds us of the clean designs that made <a href=\"https://howl.link/yr3jc8odmvq1o\">Corsair's 4000D Airflow</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-5000D-Airflow-Tempered-Mid-Tower/dp/B08M49WW51?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5000D</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/lxsdyl87t1773\">7000D</a>, et cetera) so appealing, but we much prefer Antec's case to the directly comparable <a href=\"https://howl.link/ynnjwvcofqcnj\">Corsair 6500D Airflow</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m24s038.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5099\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a69f1f54-8546-4eed-aa9c-825648bd0df5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Functionally, the usual benefits of dual-chamber design apply: there's plenty of space to work with in both chambers, including storage space for cables and drives. Dual chamber cases frequently have cable channels so deep that it's difficult to reach tie points at the bottom and effectively bundle cables, but the C8's removable \"air duct partition\" solves that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h09m59s388_0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5142\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c7b3c7e4-a2ce-486d-9689-5170b82208f5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The centerpiece of the C8 ARGB (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/surprisingly-good-antec-c8-argb-case-review-thermals-cable-management-noise\">our review</a>) is the bottom fan mount, containing two unusual 160mm x 35mm reverse-blade intake fans (with an additional conventional 140mm exhaust fan at the rear of the case). These two 160mm fans are placed over a completely open vent, meaning that the removable bottom filter is the only obstruction to incoming air. Antec was aware enough to not obstruct this intake path, unlike many other companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m57s014_0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5101\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m57s014_0.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m57s014_0.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5101\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"671b95d5-d2c0-43b6-8d8f-b5d669562364\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m01s386.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5102\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m01s386.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m01s386.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5102\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d4fb6c9-253a-4885-a956-49dd64872e4b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>This makes GPU cooling in the C8 ARGB excellent, although CPU cooling with our test setup was predictably lackluster due to the lack of front or side intake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We prefer the C8 ARGB to the fanless base model, but the less expensive SKU may make more sense for liquid-cooled builds since the ARGB's 160mm stock fans won't match any normal radiator. The case can fit up to 3x 360mm radiators simultaneously, most easily in the side and bottom slots. For air cooled builds, the $20 upcharge for the ARGB variant with the extra fans is worth it. Many of the dual-chamber cases we've reviewed have followed in the footsteps of the O11 Dynamic by not including any stock fans, so having a choice is a welcome change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Best Out-of-the-Box Case Thermals (Lian Li Lancool 207, Antec Flux Pro)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lian Li Lancool 207 <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/lian-li-lancool-207-airflow-case-review-cable-management-build-quality-benchmarks\">original review</a> | <a href=\"https://howl.link/0afr2uvggpxh7\">Newegg</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-Optimized-Pre-Installed-Tempered/dp/B0DHXWYK4J?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Amazon</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Antec Flux Pro <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/best-case-2024-so-far-antec-flux-pro-review-benchmarks\">original review</a> | <a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\">Newegg</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Amazon</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m14s621.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5103\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"024d468b-14c8-4786-8fc0-5e8dbe8a944f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Our next two awards are for thermals.

The difference is that noise-normalized is focused on one category, whereas Best Thermals looks for the best performer in all tests we ran and at all fan speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The raw all-fans-maxed stock performance is a tie between the <a href=\"https://howl.link/0afr2uvggpxh7\">Lian Li Lancool 207</a>, represented in the sub $100 category, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\">Antec Flux Pro</a>, which is represented in the next category. These cases have similar layouts, each with front intake fans behind a mesh panel and bottom intake fans mounted on top of a ventilated PSU shroud. Our test bench hardware uses air cooling with a flow-through GPU cooler and a CPU tower cooler, which we've chosen to be as broadly representative as possible and as controllable as possible. This hardware benefits from simple, direct airflow: cool air from the front for the CPU, cool air from the bottom for the GPU. These two cases are the ideal realization of that airflow pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m19s841.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5104\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"94aa3b21-cded-4c1f-9229-e08e105ad11f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Flux Pro</a> and Lancool 207 both averaged 38 degrees Celsius above ambient all-core and 42 degrees on just the P-cores. <a href=\"https://howl.link/efrb972lwvb4w\">Fractal's Torrent</a> and North XL are both within one degree of this result, but the Flux Pro (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/best-case-2024-so-far-antec-flux-pro-review-benchmarks\">review</a>) and 207 pull slightly ahead in other categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m32s931.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5105\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8c24919a-a1dc-442c-b596-8ba6b4344b13\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Moving to GPU thermals, both the Flux Pro and the Lancool 207 averaged exactly 38.2 degrees above ambient, although the 207's memory temperature averaged slightly better at 41 degrees versus 43, while the Flux Pro's hotspot temperature was a little lower.

With the current iteration of our bench, we place the case on a table in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUqYTenB2A0\">hemi-anechoic chamber </a>with a mic pointed directly at the center of the front panel from one meter away. Then, we lower the speed of the case's stock fans in tandem until we hit our chosen threshold of 27 dBA SPL. This allows us to level the playing field so that the cases with the loudest fans don't automatically land at the top of every single chart by brute force. It creates a control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Flux Pro</a>'s front panel doesn't block much noise, but it's so well-ventilated that the three 140mm front intake fans don't need to work hard and don’t generate much noise to begin with. There isn’t much resistance and so they can spin slower, while the 2x 120mm shroud-top fans assist GPU cooling. The Flux Pro's PSU shroud is open on all sides, including the bottom, which maximizes airflow without directing significantly more noise towards our mic.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m04s908.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5111\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"504cf479-c58a-47fa-b54c-acd24073fb33\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>CPU thermals are tied at the top of the chart with the Lancool 207 at 41 degrees Celsius above ambient all-core and 45 degrees on just the P-cores.

different design, even if it doesn't work perfectly, because innovation pushes this industry forward. This goes to the <a href=\"https://meshless.design/collections/a4\">Meshless AIO</a> Mini-ITX case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its generic, boxy exterior, the Meshless AIO (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/better-computer-fan-sometimes-cross-flow-meshless-aio-case-benchmarks-review\">review</a>) is one of the most innovative cases we've ever reviewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meshless AIO (now apparently listed with a formal launch name as the “<a href=\"https://meshless.design/products/meshless-aio\">MD280</a>”) is built around a cylindrical crossflow fan, like a smaller version of the fan in a mini-split wall unit. We found the case design curious enough that we built this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9CWqCRFroZ0?t=731\">3D animation</a> to help explain and educate on how these work. The basics are that the crossflow fan shoots hot air out at the upper edge of the side panel, and theoretically pulls cool air in everywhere else: towards the GPU fans from the side panel, through the radiator, and over the motherboard and PSU from a tiny strip of ventilation along the bottom edge of the case. In practice, we found that the GPU was better cooled by taping a couple of normal 120mm case fans to the top of the case, but these had other downsides in other tests. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m46s720.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5124\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m46s720.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m46s720.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5124\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a91c3560-6bb1-4118-89d9-ba540522391e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m49s114.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5125\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m49s114.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m49s114.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5125\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5fa9d04d-a19c-47a3-baa7-8aeca1c42ee6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>Thermal performance was at least adequate, and considering there was a single fan handling everything, overall impressive for what was done on a single fan that you might not normally find in a PC case. We were concerned about the PSU's lack of direct access to cool air, but otherwise, everything was getting fed air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some other creative aspects to the MD280’s construction outside of the fan: the main portion of the case is a single piece of extruded aluminum, and other elements like the fan, radiator, glass side panel, and handle slide into the open ends. This is an excellent and compact design that works well. Another cool feature is the lever that’s accessible from the rear of the case, working to slide the PCIe riser cable up and down. It presses the slot into place to improve accessibility. It's an ambitious and creative project, especially since Meshless Design informed us that it's an independent outfit driven by one man: Hank Lin. This is the work of an engineer who turned an idea into an actual product with overall good execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to issue a buyer beware warning here: it looks like the Meshless AIO's price has been increased to at least $450, a big jump from what we were expecting, and we have no way of vouching for the company's ability to deliver on pre-orders. Unfortunately, that price kills the case for us, as there are simply too many other good competitors in ITX at half the price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it still gets an innovation award.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m35s839.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5126\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m35s839.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m35s839.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5126\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7ff8f97c-51b5-496e-9b40-d2991eda9feb\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m38s948.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5127\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m38s948.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m38s948.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5127\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"74ebf38f-f2a2-4f6d-9787-da407e983140\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m44s021.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5128\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m44s021.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m44s021.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5128\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"bfa87161-db25-4548-a0f0-f81d55fe3228\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>We have an Honorable Mention for this category as well: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dubili-Chassis-iBuildiShare-Preinstall-Champagne/dp/B0CFNFB2JX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">InWin’s Dubili</a> ATX case. Dubili is an anagram of iBuild, an abbreviation for InWin's DIY \"iBuild iShare\" brand, as well as an abbreviation of \"Do Believe.\" The instruction manual comes in the form of a dedicated single-purpose app with animated 3D renders, which is absolutely required if you order the flat-packed build-it-yourself DIY edition. We like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/bmwjx2f1tff1d\">Dubili</a> for its unique look, high-quality build and materials, and the modularity of the paneling. That it flat packs is also a cool aspect to the case, creating a fuller DIY experience. The color scheme is also different: A sharp silver-and-orange or a Noctua-style cream-and-brown with gold screws. The case doesn’t win over the Meshless AIO, but we like it enough that it deserves a mention.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contente17b5987-3de5-4703-8431-216cc577e60d\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/15-yr-mouse-mat\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/mousemat-ad%20copy.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1487\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0238852a-eb52-4dc5-8cbb-702657d9176f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/15-yr-mouse-mat\">GN15 All-Over Print Component Mouse Mat</a> for a high-quality mousing surface that'll fit your keyboard & mouse.

href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-6500X-Mid-Tower-Dual-Chamber/dp/B0CQ59S798?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">6500</a> series of cases. Although Tryx’s case was a mess, it ultimately doesn’t have the same expectations attached to it as Corsair. To be a disappointment requires some level of expectation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corsair wins the award handily: Broadly speaking, Corsair has continued to disappoint ever since it took on huge investment. Like the assets of its corporate overlords, its disappointments are diversified: They bought Origin, which sold us a $6,600 computer that had the CPU <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflZYG5DWPg\">underclocked by 1GHz out of the box</a>; they made the <a href=\"https://howl.link/t3xrae6k0pell\">A500 air cooler</a>, which had heatpipes so unlevel they sheared our pressure paper. But the company also shipped some excellent products in recent years, and those came from its case division.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsair 4000D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYsOmJ9X7Ow\">our review</a>) was commonly $80 and one of the best sub-$100 cases available for a while. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/qc4y7bhmdw5d4\">5000D</a> (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_qa49gHzw\">our review</a>) was an OK follow-up to that, scaling-up the useful features to a larger size. Corsair was finally doing well with cases again, following a long drought of basically nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then it launched the 6500 (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/corsair-forgot-how-make-case-6500d-airflow-6500x-review\">review</a>) series this year, attempting to jump onto a hype train that had already left the station, and doing so with substandard build quality. The Corsair 6500D and 6500X were $200 without fans, both featuring superbly bendy panels without any reinforcement -- which we found totally unacceptable for a $200 so-called “Premium” case. There were lots of plastics, misaligned panels, and build quality issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 6500D had a number of slapped-on features that didn’t work together. They tried to accommodate back-connect motherboards, but doing so required punching what seems like a completely random hole into a drive cage, which was then entirely left out of the original manual. If you used one of Corsair’s own SHIFT power supplies, you’d have to remove the drive cages completely and move to only NVMe drives. We found build quality issues, design oversight, and a high price to be not only disqualifying from any considerations on our lists, but also deserving of the Biggest Disappointment after falling from the grace of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-4000D-Airflow-Tempered-Mid-Tower/dp/B08C7BGV3D?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">4000D</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corsair is a big company and has the resources to fix this, but it’s a matter of whether they choose to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our critical review, Corsair has dropped the price of the 6500D closer to $150. It’s still worse than an Antec C8 ARGB, which often costs the same or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

Although other cases are superior in some individual situations, like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\">Antec Flux Pro</a> (by a slim margin) in thermals or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HAVN-Dual-Chamber-Radiator-SimpliCable-Management/dp/B0DDCMHXW1\">HAVN HS 420</a> in mechanical aspects, the <a href=\"https://howl.link/0n35xllzt9puf\">North</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/lrnpapmphtbqg\">North XL</a> are masterful executions of a standard computer case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is bolstered by prices that have been lower in recent weeks, typically down around $125 to $140 for the North (watch our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aor-3v6N7i8\">review</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fractal North was the first case to successfully kick-off the wooden trend at scale, with everyone else in the industry scrambling to follow. InWin gets credit for initially attempting this years ago, but it failed to find a way to bring it to market and execute. Fractal pulled it all together and cleaned up the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-14h57m39s102.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5060\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-14h57m39s102.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-14h57m39s102.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5060\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3f7d1a96-669f-49ba-b816-cb7be75b66b1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m25s838.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5061\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m25s838.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m25s838.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5061\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6badad88-6062-479f-a888-eec235c846a9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The North comes with either a glass or mesh side panel, which includes options for additional side mounts to further boost cooling performance. Actually, in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYqeI3Om1ew\">recent tour of Wendell’s offices</a>, you can see such a configuration for one of his machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fractal’s fan support on the XL is also effectively whatever you want it to be: The company cleverly uses standard hole spacing for its rear ventilation (and even PCIe slot covers and top of the power supply shroud) so that you could mount a fan basically anywhere you want in the case. The cooling options are really opened up because of this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ease-of-installation options are also great: Because the top panel so easily slides off to remove, and because Fractal doesn’t put a ton of other metal in the way, you can get clear access through the top of the case for builds. The extra width in the XL also makes larger radiators easier to work with up top, reducing board clearance issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m48s222.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5140\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m48s222.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m48s222.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5140\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ad3a22bd-cd7f-4625-8ac6-1dbfab86641b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m51s293.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5139\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m51s293.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m51s293.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5139\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"355f6745-3776-4ae9-a746-6a6e1957f889\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The North XL (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/fractal-north-xl-case-review-benchmarks-wood-panels-mesh\">our review</a>) is what we prefer to the North, mostly for its increased size for easier building and for our style of build, but both are good takes on the theme. Visually, the wood look doesn’t look like the slapped-on Vinyl style we see in other cases. It looks more purposeful. Fractal also does great work mixing different tone wood coloring with different panel coloring, including matching the black case with gold accents and the white case with silver accents.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h04m55s654.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5062\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"86439380-10fe-4786-8e30-306cee2e792d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>And finally, even in cooling performance, the North XL is routinely at the top of the charts for thermal benchmarks. It’s not the best -- that’ll go to two other cases this year -- but it’s regularly at the top, and that plus all the other features, plus the value, get the North cases the Best Overall

href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HAVN-Dual-Chamber-Radiator-SimpliCable-Management/dp/B0DDCMHXW1\">HS 420</a>. The HS 420 (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/new-type-computer-case-havn-hs-420-thermal-benchmarks-review\">review</a>) exhibits a mastery of mechanical features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HS 420 doesn't include fans, it's not fully airflow-focused, and it isn't cheap at $200 for the horizontal GPU model. That makes it a tough fit for our price- and performance-focused award categories, but it needs to be recognized, because it's one of the most interesting and downright good cases that we've reviewed this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanically, it’s excellent. The curved tempered glass panel is the most significant feature. The panel is installed by sliding it back and down into the case on plastic wheels, where it then comes to rest on the bottom edge of the chassis. It takes some getting used to, but it's a clever and secure way of getting the huge glass pane seated. It's also proven to be durable, surviving multiple build/unbuild cycles through the filming process without serious wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a lot of thought put into airflow, something we illustrated in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2RytD3xII-0?t=404\">animations</a>. The HS 420 VGPU includes a curved glass deflector that's intended to direct incoming air around and into vertically-mounted GPUs. It was a clever idea and a fresh approach, which we appreciated, but it did not help performance in our test system. That’s also why we're specifically giving the award to the $200 base model, which is cheaper and sheds the hardware that didn’t do much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the base model, though, HAVN planned for an unusual airflow pattern with intake at the bottom of the rear panel and exhaust at the top of the same panel, and included 120mm plates on each mount that are isolated with rubber vibration damping. In fact, every fan tray is padded with rubber, including the side mount that doubles as drive storage. The drive storage alone is pretty cool. It creates a spine-like structure that can be removed for more fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case's construction is clever and precise in areas like the tightly-spaced storage bays at the front and the rounded edges of the PSU shroud and motherboard tray. The simple GPU support that ships with the non-VGPU case variant is one of the sturdiest we've seen, cast from solid metal and braced against the PSU shroud. The cable channels are not only labeled, but color-coded in what is an excellent feature, as it helps new builders understand where to route cables.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h06m22s188.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5074\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3c73e8dd-7b8b-4e44-99d5-32fa72349fcf\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>There are a ton of other small attention-to-detail elements, like the fact that HAVN matched the structural reinforcement for the panels to align with fan hubs, or the dead zone, rather than obstructing air intake.

The ALTA D1 is an $800 halo product that's finally hit retail following our first encounter with it at Computex 2023 and again at Computex 2024. The price is ridiculous and very few people will buy the case, but the mechanical design hopefully inspires some more affordable cases: It has modular bays on rails everywhere, including 5.25\" drive support, socketable radiators, a slide-out motherboard tray, SSI-EEB support, 11 expansion slots, large fan mounts, repositionable power supplies, and a true home server setup. It's beyond what we could recommend in a serious review if only for the price, but we may come up with a fun project for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Modular-Workstation-SST-ALD1B/dp/B0DJQ73NM8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">ALTA D1</a> in the future and we respect its mechanical design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Best Sub-$100 Case: Lian Li Lancool 207</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/lian-li-lancool-207-airflow-case-review-cable-management-build-quality-benchmarks\"><strong>Original review</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://howl.link/0afr2uvggpxh7\"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-Optimized-Pre-Installed-Tempered/dp/B0DHXWYK4J?tag=gamersnexus01-20\"><strong>Amazon</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve had a category for years for the “Best Budget Case,” but the amount of quality cases in the $60 price point and under has really declined in recent years.

In the current market, $80 is dirt cheap for a name-brand case: there are cheaper cases available from companies like SAMA and DIYPC, but we're confident that none of them come close to the Lancool 207's frequently chart-topping thermal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h09m02s907.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5091\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"32ebf9a7-ab8d-49bb-811e-cde9e8301b68\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>When we <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/68-case-4-fans-silverstone-515xr-100-514x-case-reviews\">reviewed</a> the SilverStone 515XR, we were aware that SilverStone had pulled out all the stops to offer a case with four fans at $68, but the performance gap between it and the 207 is massive. There’s also differences in quality-of-life features. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h09m05s635.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5092\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d1af546a-3bcb-4d70-8353-a31f704e97ed\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The same goes for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/eorapgqyn4u0c\">Phanteks XT Pro Ultra</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mid-Tower-Pre-Installed-Full-View-Wood-Grain-Interface/dp/B0D5PQTCS9?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Montech XR</a>. Both cases have been added to our charts recently. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/vsucpvvlku612\">Montech XR</a> is supposed to be closer to $60, but has been out of stock lately and often more expensive when it is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-Optimized-Pre-Installed-Tempered/dp/B0DHXWYK4J?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Lancool 207</a> is a solidly-built case with sturdy toolless panels, which is unusual at this price point. The most unusual aspect, though, is at the bottom of the case, where two 120mm intake fans are positioned directly underneath the GPU, while the PSU is mounted at the front with an extension cord. The shroud is ventilated on both sides as well as the rear in order to provide an airflow path for the bottom intake fans (although adding drives and cables to the case reduces that ventilation, but the ample intake through the rear counters this). In addition to the two bottom intake fans, 2x 140mm ARGB front intake fans are included with the case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They may not sound significant individually, but the fact that the 207 has a full suite of basic quality of life features like reusable (and bridgeless) expansion slot covers, rubber grommets for cable cutouts, a USB Type-C port, ARGB fans, built-in velcro straps, and toolless panels is impressive in combination with its price and thermal performance. It's rare to see that full combo in a case, especially one which is also a top thermal performer. The fact that the 207 also wins our objective, numbers-based Best Thermals category is also part of why it lands here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have two big issues with the 207: first, the toolless side panel won't stay on without meticulous cable management. There's no way around this, but sticking to flat cables and minimizing the number of cables used will help. There's also room to improve PSU cooling in the case, as most PSUs will be oriented fan-side-down with barely any clearance above the table surface. The cable management is the one to be aware of.

We’re looking for something that isn’t too wild or out there. We want relatively standard, but a good price-to-performance and overall build quality. We’re also looking for something a little bit better than the budget case. For this, we’re giving it to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-C8-ARGB-Dual-Chamber-Compatible/dp/B0CT2LSSHK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Antec C8 ARGB</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antec has had a strong year. It had 2 showings this year in our list we have today, but it was the <a href=\"https://howl.link/ew6eo2gp9acas\">Antec C8</a> that first signaled to us that the company was worth paying attention to again after a decade of fading into irrelevance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $150 for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/ia4a8mz0qlu1p\">ARGB variant</a> with fans included, but it's been long enough since the case's June launch that we're beginning to see discounts. The fan-less variant is regularly available with promo codes around $100. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mid-range award category gives us some room to consider quality of life and aesthetic features, not just raw performance-per-dollar, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-C8-ARGB-Dual-Chamber-Compatible/dp/B0CT2LSSHK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">C8</a> is well-balanced in those categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The C8's dual chamber layout isn’t new, but Antec impressed us with the level of care that it put into details like molding text into the fan frames, color-matching all the components in the white SKU, and the accessory kit. Small touches, even ones that aren't functional, add up to create a product that feels worth the price. The C8's appearance reminds us of the clean designs that made <a href=\"https://howl.link/yr3jc8odmvq1o\">Corsair's 4000D Airflow</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-5000D-Airflow-Tempered-Mid-Tower/dp/B08M49WW51?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5000D</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/lxsdyl87t1773\">7000D</a>, et cetera) so appealing, but we much prefer Antec's case to the directly comparable <a href=\"https://howl.link/ynnjwvcofqcnj\">Corsair 6500D Airflow</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m24s038.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5099\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a69f1f54-8546-4eed-aa9c-825648bd0df5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Functionally, the usual benefits of dual-chamber design apply: there's plenty of space to work with in both chambers, including storage space for cables and drives. Dual chamber cases frequently have cable channels so deep that it's difficult to reach tie points at the bottom and effectively bundle cables, but the C8's removable \"air duct partition\" solves that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h09m59s388_0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5142\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c7b3c7e4-a2ce-486d-9689-5170b82208f5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The centerpiece of the C8 ARGB (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/surprisingly-good-antec-c8-argb-case-review-thermals-cable-management-noise\">our review</a>) is the bottom fan mount, containing two unusual 160mm x 35mm reverse-blade intake fans (with an additional conventional 140mm exhaust fan at the rear of the case). These two 160mm fans are placed over a completely open vent, meaning that the removable bottom filter is the only obstruction to incoming air. Antec was aware enough to not obstruct this intake path, unlike many other companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m57s014_0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5101\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m57s014_0.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h10m57s014_0.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5101\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"671b95d5-d2c0-43b6-8d8f-b5d669562364\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m01s386.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5102\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m01s386.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m01s386.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5102\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"4d4fb6c9-253a-4885-a956-49dd64872e4b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>This makes GPU cooling in the C8 ARGB excellent, although CPU cooling with our test setup was predictably lackluster due to the lack of front or side intake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We prefer the C8 ARGB to the fanless base model, but the less expensive SKU may make more sense for liquid-cooled builds since the ARGB's 160mm stock fans won't match any normal radiator. The case can fit up to 3x 360mm radiators simultaneously, most easily in the side and bottom slots. For air cooled builds, the $20 upcharge for the ARGB variant with the extra fans is worth it. Many of the dual-chamber cases we've reviewed have followed in the footsteps of the O11 Dynamic by not including any stock fans, so having a choice is a welcome change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Best Out-of-the-Box Case Thermals (Lian Li Lancool 207, Antec Flux Pro)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lian Li Lancool 207 <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/lian-li-lancool-207-airflow-case-review-cable-management-build-quality-benchmarks\">original review</a> | <a href=\"https://howl.link/0afr2uvggpxh7\">Newegg</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-Optimized-Pre-Installed-Tempered/dp/B0DHXWYK4J?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Amazon</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Antec Flux Pro <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/best-case-2024-so-far-antec-flux-pro-review-benchmarks\">original review</a> | <a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\">Newegg</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Amazon</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m14s621.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5103\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"024d468b-14c8-4786-8fc0-5e8dbe8a944f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Our next two awards are for thermals. The next one is for Best Noise-Normalized Thermals, while this one is for Best Out-of-the-Box Thermals. The difference is that noise-normalized is focused on one category, whereas Best Thermals looks for the best performer in all tests we ran and at all fan speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The raw all-fans-maxed stock performance is a tie between the <a href=\"https://howl.link/0afr2uvggpxh7\">Lian Li Lancool 207</a>, represented in the sub $100 category, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/tfuw1ccukvksr\">Antec Flux Pro</a>, which is represented in the next category. These cases have similar layouts, each with front intake fans behind a mesh panel and bottom intake fans mounted on top of a ventilated PSU shroud. Our test bench hardware uses air cooling with a flow-through GPU cooler and a CPU tower cooler, which we've chosen to be as broadly representative as possible and as controllable as possible. This hardware benefits from simple, direct airflow: cool air from the front for the CPU, cool air from the bottom for the GPU. These two cases are the ideal realization of that airflow pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m19s841.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5104\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"94aa3b21-cded-4c1f-9229-e08e105ad11f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Flux Pro</a> and Lancool 207 both averaged 38 degrees Celsius above ambient all-core and 42 degrees on just the P-cores. <a href=\"https://howl.link/efrb972lwvb4w\">Fractal's Torrent</a> and North XL are both within one degree of this result, but the Flux Pro (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/best-case-2024-so-far-antec-flux-pro-review-benchmarks\">review</a>) and 207 pull slightly ahead in other categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h11m32s931.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5105\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8c24919a-a1dc-442c-b596-8ba6b4344b13\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Moving to GPU thermals, both the Flux Pro and the Lancool 207 averaged exactly 38.2 degrees above ambient, although the 207's memory temperature averaged slightly better at 41 degrees versus 43, while the Flux Pro's hotspot temperature was a little lower. The Flux Pro's stock configuration is set up to mount the PSU rotated 90 degrees in Antec's \"iShift\" mount, but we found that mounting the PSU in a more typical orientation with the plug at the rear of the case slightly lowered overall GPU temperatures for a best-case 37 degree delta above ambient.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h12m14s674.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5106\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b6eb7088-e062-4a68-b48b-95d5158a3aed\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 207, on the other hand, logged our best temperatures so far from the VRM and RAM sensors at 21 and 17 degrees above ambient respectively.

Then, we lower the speed of the case's stock fans in tandem until we hit our chosen threshold of 27 dBA SPL.

different design, even if it doesn't work perfectly, because innovation pushes this industry forward. This goes to the <a href=\"https://meshless.design/collections/a4\">Meshless AIO</a> Mini-ITX case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its generic, boxy exterior, the Meshless AIO (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/better-computer-fan-sometimes-cross-flow-meshless-aio-case-benchmarks-review\">review</a>) is one of the most innovative cases we've ever reviewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meshless AIO (now apparently listed with a formal launch name as the “<a href=\"https://meshless.design/products/meshless-aio\">MD280</a>”) is built around a cylindrical crossflow fan, like a smaller version of the fan in a mini-split wall unit. We found the case design curious enough that we built this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9CWqCRFroZ0?t=731\">3D animation</a> to help explain and educate on how these work. The basics are that the crossflow fan shoots hot air out at the upper edge of the side panel, and theoretically pulls cool air in everywhere else: towards the GPU fans from the side panel, through the radiator, and over the motherboard and PSU from a tiny strip of ventilation along the bottom edge of the case. In practice, we found that the GPU was better cooled by taping a couple of normal 120mm case fans to the top of the case, but these had other downsides in other tests. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m46s720.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5124\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m46s720.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m46s720.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5124\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a91c3560-6bb1-4118-89d9-ba540522391e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m49s114.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5125\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m49s114.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h13m49s114.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5125\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5fa9d04d-a19c-47a3-baa7-8aeca1c42ee6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>Thermal performance was at least adequate, and considering there was a single fan handling everything, overall impressive for what was done on a single fan that you might not normally find in a PC case. We were concerned about the PSU's lack of direct access to cool air, but otherwise, everything was getting fed air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some other creative aspects to the MD280’s construction outside of the fan: the main portion of the case is a single piece of extruded aluminum, and other elements like the fan, radiator, glass side panel, and handle slide into the open ends. This is an excellent and compact design that works well. Another cool feature is the lever that’s accessible from the rear of the case, working to slide the PCIe riser cable up and down. It presses the slot into place to improve accessibility. It's an ambitious and creative project, especially since Meshless Design informed us that it's an independent outfit driven by one man: Hank Lin. This is the work of an engineer who turned an idea into an actual product with overall good execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to issue a buyer beware warning here: it looks like the Meshless AIO's price has been increased to at least $450, a big jump from what we were expecting, and we have no way of vouching for the company's ability to deliver on pre-orders. Unfortunately, that price kills the case for us, as there are simply too many other good competitors in ITX at half the price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it still gets an innovation award.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m35s839.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5126\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m35s839.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m35s839.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5126\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7ff8f97c-51b5-496e-9b40-d2991eda9feb\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m38s948.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5127\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m38s948.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m38s948.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5127\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"74ebf38f-f2a2-4f6d-9787-da407e983140\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m44s021.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"5128\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m44s021.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-26-15h14m44s021.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-5128\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"bfa87161-db25-4548-a0f0-f81d55fe3228\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>We have an Honorable Mention for this category as well: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dubili-Chassis-iBuildiShare-Preinstall-Champagne/dp/B0CFNFB2JX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">InWin’s Dubili</a> ATX case. Dubili is an anagram of iBuild, an abbreviation for InWin's DIY \"iBuild iShare\" brand, as well as an abbreviation of \"Do Believe.\" The instruction manual comes in the form of a dedicated single-purpose app with animated 3D renders, which is absolutely required if you order the flat-packed build-it-yourself DIY edition. We like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/bmwjx2f1tff1d\">Dubili</a> for its unique look, high-quality build and materials, and the modularity of the paneling. That it flat packs is also a cool aspect to the case, creating a fuller DIY experience. The color scheme is also different: A sharp silver-and-orange or a Noctua-style cream-and-brown with gold screws.

href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-6500X-Mid-Tower-Dual-Chamber/dp/B0CQ59S798?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">6500</a> series of cases. Although Tryx’s case was a mess, it ultimately doesn’t have the same expectations attached to it as Corsair. To be a disappointment requires some level of expectation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corsair wins the award handily: Broadly speaking, Corsair has continued to disappoint ever since it took on huge investment. Like the assets of its corporate overlords, its disappointments are diversified: They bought Origin, which sold us a $6,600 computer that had the CPU <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflZYG5DWPg\">underclocked by 1GHz out of the box</a>; they made the <a href=\"https://howl.link/t3xrae6k0pell\">A500 air cooler</a>, which had heatpipes so unlevel they sheared our pressure paper. But the company also shipped some excellent products in recent years, and those came from its case division.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsair 4000D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYsOmJ9X7Ow\">our review</a>) was commonly $80 and one of the best sub-$100 cases available for a while. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/qc4y7bhmdw5d4\">5000D</a> (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_qa49gHzw\">our review</a>) was an OK follow-up to that, scaling-up the useful features to a larger size. Corsair was finally doing well with cases again, following a long drought of basically nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then it launched the 6500 (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/corsair-forgot-how-make-case-6500d-airflow-6500x-review\">review</a>) series this year, attempting to jump onto a hype train that had already left the station, and doing so with substandard build quality. The Corsair 6500D and 6500X were $200 without fans, both featuring superbly bendy panels without any reinforcement -- which we found totally unacceptable for a $200 so-called “Premium” case. There were lots of plastics, misaligned panels, and build quality issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 6500D had a number of slapped-on features that didn’t work together. They tried to accommodate back-connect motherboards, but doing so required punching what seems like a completely random hole into a drive cage, which was then entirely left out of the original manual. If you used one of Corsair’s own SHIFT power supplies, you’d have to remove the drive cages completely and move to only NVMe drives. We found build quality issues, design oversight, and a high price to be not only disqualifying from any considerations on our lists, but also deserving of the Biggest Disappointment after falling from the grace of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-4000D-Airflow-Tempered-Mid-Tower/dp/B08C7BGV3D?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">4000D</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corsair is a big company and has the resources to fix this, but it’s a matter of whether they choose to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our critical review, Corsair has dropped the price of the 6500D closer to $150. It’s still worse than an Antec C8 ARGB, which often costs the same or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

It wasn’t always the case that 3 generations of parts existed new-in-box from both vendors. They’d typically cleared some of those out by now, but with AMD and Intel alike, there are actually good, older parts available in some categories. They’re everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on November 16, 2024 as a video.

We run these at the end of every year to get people back up to speed efficiently. A lot of you only check-in on PC part performance every few years for a new build, so this article will serve as a quick-start point for you to figure out which CPUs to pay the most attention to in your research. It also helps us get back up to speed on our own test data. As you find CPUs you’re interested in from this article, you can check out the in-depth reviews linked below for each of those components. That’ll get you everything you need to make a decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, these round-ups don’t go as charts-heavy as our usual reviews. We’ll scatter them to support the points, but the goal is to provide a quick-and-easy recap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"overview-best-cpus-for-2024\"><strong>Overview: Best

It’s not the best in these workloads, but it’s still capable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h03m17s045.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4999\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aaee45d3-0f5e-4302-be8d-f828538ad140\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Blender, the 9800X3D doesn’t benefit from its extra cache, but still manages to at least outperform the lower power budget Zen 5 components that are 8 cores and fewer, like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/2tqq22owqn4tn\">9700X</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h03m19s746.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5000\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"effc3788-e691-4914-a351-9c9ebf4f80e6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Photoshop, the 9800X3D ended up as our best performer. Photoshop likes Zen 5 in general and benefits from its architectural changes, and that really shows on the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D is also an excellent overclocker and is fully unlocked, something that wasn’t true for the prior X3D parts. It’s such a good OC part that we even took it to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZMQf3RwM8Q\">stream</a> to use liquid nitrogen to overclock it at -140 degrees Celsius, yielding some ridiculous performance scaling in real games that we might not have expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h03m34s716.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5001\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a0a69e73-3489-47a1-86c3-15603ac11fe4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>AMD moved the cache die closer to the substrate, with the core complex getting the cores right against the inside of the integrated heat spreader for this generation. This has helped improve the thermal situation, which is what gives AMD more clock headroom. AMD designed Zen 5 ground-up for X3D this time. It’s also a single CCD part, which keeps things as simple as possible to set up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know the 9800X3D is king in gaming, but it’s all these other reasons that make it the Best Overall CPU for 2024. We can highly recommend this one for new, high-end gaming builds especially, but it’s still an overall competent performer in workstation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"most-balanced-cpu\"><strong>Most Balanced CPU: i9-14900K & R9 7950X</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRaJXZMOMPU\">Original review</a> | <a href=\"https://howl.link/an3en99p6o77l\">Newegg</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Amazon </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next award is for the Most Balanced CPU, which is a category we’ve used for years to ensure credit is given to CPUs that perform well both in workstation or production applications and in gaming.

This is the best CPU that can drop into a prior generation of motherboards. In-socket upgrades are great for consumers, reduce wasteful spending on more boards and RAM but also reduce e-waste, and keep builds more affordable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h08m31s472.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5021\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"20d36b3c-35d1-4b4f-86e6-56494c384a86\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This year, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">AMD R7 5700X3D</a> easily secures the award. The preceding 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>) got Best Upgrade last year, but has since largely disappeared as a new-in-box purchase and its price has gone up. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/m42f17be2dkh3\">5700X3D</a> has taken its place, commonly available between a shockingly low $180 or a more typical $230.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>) is able to achieve most of the performance of the 5800X3D CPU when looking at our gaming charts. Typically, it’s within 10 percentage points, often fewer. The 5800X3D benefits from a higher frequency though, so there are some situations where you’ll see the 5700X3D dip down the charts. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h08m54s930.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5022\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"24d687cf-1ae3-4696-9c09-1130668d779c\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>One example is the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail benchmark, where our 5700X3D ran at a framerate that gave the 5800X3D an advantage of 11%. This is one of the highest deltas we saw in gaming between the 2 parts. The 5600X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-5600x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-last-chance-upgrade\">our review</a>) even outperforms the 5700X3D in Final Fantasy, which sometimes confuses people. The 5600X3D may have fewer cores, but its frequency is 300MHz higher. Both are 105W TDP parts, but reducing core count means more power budget available for the clock. Generally speaking, the 5700X3D is the better performer between the 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h09m03s807.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5023\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"649b0b6d-0e4d-4371-9bc5-f301d0ed9ab9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Baldur’s Gate 3, we saw the 5700X3D just behind the 7600X3D and about 10 FPS behind the 5800X3D. That’s an incredible rank for a part around $230, especially considering it’s outperforming a $630 285K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">our review</a>) or $440 14900K (depending on when you read this, as that price keeps changing).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, the 5700X3D’s price is wild, and the fact that AM4 boards exist in high quantities on the used market also makes it a good consideration for a used build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CPU can socket into AM4 motherboards, keeping cost down. If you already have an AM4 board from an old Ryzen build, it’s likely that a BIOS update will allow it to support the 5700X3D. Some older boards, especially from the first gen of Ryzen, are spotty on their support, so check the motherboard CPU support list to be sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h11m36s122.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5024\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a2c5e878-c205-4481-bf61-82a2d93fc6b1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We’re going to give a runner-up mention to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/kltpmfai2eey2\">i7-14700K</a> (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-desperate-i7-14700k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>), which is about $350 these days.

The i3-13100F (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSJwlVvh7m4\">our review</a>) is $80.

We recently reran the 12100F and found that it was capable in every game we tested, with one exception of extremely spotty frametimes in our Baldur’s Gate 3 test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s impressive how much these 3 CPUs are capable of. They’re still playing games, and mostly without major frame pacing issues. It’s just unfortunate that Intel and AMD haven’t really launched anything new into this market for such a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"biggest-disappointment\"><strong>Biggest Disappointment: Intel Instability</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h16m02s776.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5047\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ee50cb43-70ee-4265-847c-5122c551fa13\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The last category is the Biggest Disappointment. Intel gets this one for the second year running -- 2022 saw it going to AMD for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/eww95qcu49c1h\">4500</a>. But this year’s disappointment puts all other ones into perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVdmK1UGzGs\">13th and 14th gen stability issues</a> get this year’s award, reminding us that where other disappointments simply suck, there’s always room to suck more. The 13th and 14th Gen CPUs experienced a mix of problems, including fab-level oxidation defects confirmed by Intel all the way up to wider-scale stability issues relating to voltage and microcode. Intel fumbled the handling of this and lost consumer confidence, dragging its feet on a response and then trying to craft a careful narrative when it finally did respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was followed-up by the Ultra 200 series, which went back to simply being a disappointing set of products rather than a truly catastrophic failure. But this industry needs Intel and AMD to compete in a healthy environment: Intel of the past showed us what happens when the market has only one dominating vendor, and NVIDIA in GPUs shows us similar. It’s just not the job of consumers to prop-up a company that sells sub-par products -- or in the case of the disappointment this year, ones which have potential time-bomb failures baked-in. In the very least, Intel at least eventually responded with microcode patches that the company says has fixed the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"best-CPU-conclusion\">Best CPUs of 2024 <strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

Remember that we almost always consider price in our choices, so some of those may move around as prices fluctuate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s always weird when some of the best parts are prior generation components, but that’s becoming more common in both the CPU and GPU space lately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest area that’s lacking in CPUs right now is the sub-$100 market, which is aging with the 12100F and <a href=\"https://howl.link/yyqfhc8i9sqr9\">13100F</a>. The R5 <a href=\"https://howl.link/v2pt2bpehltdb\">5600</a> is only rarely sub-$100 right now, but would probably become the go-to choice if it ever solidifies in that range.

It wasn’t always the case that 3 generations of parts existed new-in-box from both vendors. They’d typically cleared some of those out by now, but with AMD and Intel alike, there are actually good, older parts available in some categories.

We’ll save the gaming discussion for this CPU for that category in a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/rip-intel-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-285k-14900k-more\">our review</a>) gets Best Overall for a few other key reasons: First, its $480 price makes it a better buy than several of the other high-end CPUs that have come out recently, such as the <a href=\"https://howl.link/8vecjwwy4kzn1\">Intel 285K</a> at $630 launch pricing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h03m13s266.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4998\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5e67a307-b8bf-45c9-8eb7-bfcbbdbcc047\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Secondly, the 9800X3D manages chart-topping gaming performance -- which we’ll save for discussion in our Best Gaming category -- while also managing overall acceptable production and workstation application performance. It’s not the best in these workloads, but it’s still capable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h03m17s045.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4999\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aaee45d3-0f5e-4302-be8d-f828538ad140\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Blender, the 9800X3D doesn’t benefit from its extra cache, but still manages to at least outperform the lower power budget Zen 5 components that are 8 cores and fewer, like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/2tqq22owqn4tn\">9700X</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h03m19s746.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5000\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"effc3788-e691-4914-a351-9c9ebf4f80e6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Photoshop, the 9800X3D ended up as our best performer. Photoshop likes Zen 5 in general and benefits from its architectural changes, and that really shows on the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D is also an excellent overclocker and is fully unlocked, something that wasn’t true for the prior X3D parts. It’s such a good OC part that we even took it to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZMQf3RwM8Q\">stream</a> to use liquid nitrogen to overclock it at -140 degrees Celsius, yielding some ridiculous performance scaling in real games that we might not have expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h03m34s716.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5001\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a0a69e73-3489-47a1-86c3-15603ac11fe4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>AMD moved the cache die closer to the substrate, with the core complex getting the cores right against the inside of the integrated heat spreader for this generation. This has helped improve the thermal situation, which is what gives AMD more clock headroom. AMD designed Zen 5 ground-up for X3D this time. It’s also a single CCD part, which keeps things as simple as possible to set up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know the 9800X3D is king in gaming, but it’s all these other reasons that make it the Best Overall CPU for 2024. We can highly recommend this one for new, high-end gaming builds especially, but it’s still an overall competent performer in workstation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"most-balanced-cpu\"><strong>Most Balanced CPU: i9-14900K & R9 7950X</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRaJXZMOMPU\">Original review</a> | <a href=\"https://howl.link/an3en99p6o77l\">Newegg</a> | <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Amazon </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next award is for the Most Balanced CPU, which is a category we’ve used for years to ensure credit is given to CPUs that perform well both in workstation or production applications and in gaming.

This is the best CPU that can drop into a prior generation of motherboards. In-socket upgrades are great for consumers, reduce wasteful spending on more boards and RAM but also reduce e-waste, and keep builds more affordable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h08m31s472.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5021\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"20d36b3c-35d1-4b4f-86e6-56494c384a86\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This year, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">AMD R7 5700X3D</a> easily secures the award. The preceding 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>) got Best Upgrade last year, but has since largely disappeared as a new-in-box purchase and its price has gone up. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/m42f17be2dkh3\">5700X3D</a> has taken its place, commonly available between a shockingly low $180 or a more typical $230.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>) is able to achieve most of the performance of the 5800X3D CPU when looking at our gaming charts. Typically, it’s within 10 percentage points, often fewer. The 5800X3D benefits from a higher frequency though, so there are some situations where you’ll see the 5700X3D dip down the charts. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h08m54s930.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5022\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"24d687cf-1ae3-4696-9c09-1130668d779c\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>One example is the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail benchmark, where our 5700X3D ran at a framerate that gave the 5800X3D an advantage of 11%. This is one of the highest deltas we saw in gaming between the 2 parts. The 5600X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-5600x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-last-chance-upgrade\">our review</a>) even outperforms the 5700X3D in Final Fantasy, which sometimes confuses people. The 5600X3D may have fewer cores, but its frequency is 300MHz higher. Both are 105W TDP parts, but reducing core count means more power budget available for the clock. Generally speaking, the 5700X3D is the better performer between the 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h09m03s807.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5023\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"649b0b6d-0e4d-4371-9bc5-f301d0ed9ab9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Baldur’s Gate 3, we saw the 5700X3D just behind the 7600X3D and about 10 FPS behind the 5800X3D. That’s an incredible rank for a part around $230, especially considering it’s outperforming a $630 285K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">our review</a>) or $440 14900K (depending on when you read this, as that price keeps changing).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, the 5700X3D’s price is wild, and the fact that AM4 boards exist in high quantities on the used market also makes it a good consideration for a used build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CPU can socket into AM4 motherboards, keeping cost down. If you already have an AM4 board from an old Ryzen build, it’s likely that a BIOS update will allow it to support the 5700X3D. Some older boards, especially from the first gen of Ryzen, are spotty on their support, so check the motherboard CPU support list to be sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h11m36s122.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5024\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a2c5e878-c205-4481-bf61-82a2d93fc6b1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We’re going to give a runner-up mention to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/kltpmfai2eey2\">i7-14700K</a> (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-desperate-i7-14700k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>), which is about $350 these days.

The i3-13100F (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSJwlVvh7m4\">our review</a>) is $80.

We recently reran the 12100F and found that it was capable in every game we tested, with one exception of extremely spotty frametimes in our Baldur’s Gate 3 test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s impressive how much these 3 CPUs are capable of. They’re still playing games, and mostly without major frame pacing issues. It’s just unfortunate that Intel and AMD haven’t really launched anything new into this market for such a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"biggest-disappointment\"><strong>Biggest Disappointment: Intel Instability</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-21-12h16m02s776.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5047\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ee50cb43-70ee-4265-847c-5122c551fa13\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The last category is the Biggest Disappointment. Intel gets this one for the second year running -- 2022 saw it going to AMD for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/eww95qcu49c1h\">4500</a>. But this year’s disappointment puts all other ones into perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVdmK1UGzGs\">13th and 14th gen stability issues</a> get this year’s award, reminding us that where other disappointments simply suck, there’s always room to suck more. The 13th and 14th Gen CPUs experienced a mix of problems, including fab-level oxidation defects confirmed by Intel all the way up to wider-scale stability issues relating to voltage and microcode. Intel fumbled the handling of this and lost consumer confidence, dragging its feet on a response and then trying to craft a careful narrative when it finally did respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was followed-up by the Ultra 200 series, which went back to simply being a disappointing set of products rather than a truly catastrophic failure. But this industry needs Intel and AMD to compete in a healthy environment: Intel of the past showed us what happens when the market has only one dominating vendor, and NVIDIA in GPUs shows us similar. It’s just not the job of consumers to prop-up a company that sells sub-par products -- or in the case of the disappointment this year, ones which have potential time-bomb failures baked-in. In the very least, Intel at least eventually responded with microcode patches that the company says has fixed the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"best-CPU-conclusion\">Best CPUs of 2024 <strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

It’s a 6-core, 12-thread X3D part that we bought for $300 from Micro Center in Charlotte. AMD didn’t email us about this CPU, didn’t do review sampling, and just sort of quietly launched it to the market through Micro Center. It’s similar to the 5600X3D launch (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-5600x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-last-chance-upgrade\">review here</a>). <br />This runs on Zen 4 and is advertised as having a maximum 4.7 GHz boost clock and 4.1 GHz base clock. TDP is listed at 65W. AMD’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7600X-12-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBJDS62N?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7600X</a> has a higher 105W TDP and runs an advertised maximum clock of 5.3 GHz, or 4.7 GHz base. That’ll make the <a href=\"https://howl.link/jcnlim8g2urfc\">7600X</a> better in some specific frequency-constrained scenarios that can’t utilize the extra cache, like in our non-gaming tests, but it’ll also make it more power hungry and having that extra cache normally allows better performance in gaming, even if the frequency is lower, and it tends to be more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on November 7, 2024 as a video.

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a> fluctuates more due to the power constraint, holding around 4850 MHz on average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D comes in below that, at 4700 to 4730 MHz, also moving up and down through the test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For perspective, the 7600X non-3D part ran at about the same clock as the 9800X3D, up around 5225 MHz. If you see the 7600X outperform the 7600X3D in some tests, that won’t be a surprise: Anything which relies less on the extra cache than on higher clocks will see a regression in performance. This is less prevalent on the Zen 5 9800X3D due to its higher power budget and because the <a href=\"https://howl.link/2oalvlmsuv4qd\">9700X</a> had a lower power budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>AMD R5 7600X3D Single-Core Frequency</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frequency%20Comparison%20%28Max%201T%20in%20CB%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4978\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dd4e1713-3a34-47a5-9159-f65af65b430b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This chart is for the maximum single-core boost during a Cinebench single-threaded workload. This allows us to see how fast the cores go when unlikely to breach power limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D we just reviewed held the same 5225 MHz clock we saw in all-core testing and did so throughout the benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D ran faster than its all-core workload, which is more typical. That had it at 5050 MHz during this test on the fastest core per interval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D is far slower than that, with a comparatively huge drop to 4750 MHz for the fastest single core per interval. That’s a large drop that will likely contribute to losses in certain titles, maybe like Final Fantasy, more than the core count difference between the two would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X ran at 5450 MHz for the fastest single core, which will also benefit it in lightly threaded scenarios where the extra cache doesn’t contribute much.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

It’s the new most-efficient CPU in our testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our efficiency benchmarks are a combination of both power drawn during the test and the performance output in the test, which is FPS in this situation. Tweaking either dial can improve efficiency since it’s a calculation of the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D ended up at 42.8W in this test, which has it reduced from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a>, 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>), and 7800X3D. It’s among the lowest power draw parts in this test, alongside the older R7 2700. With the 12W reduction from the 7800X3D and with performance similar to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/yigii3hjbqih9\">5700X3D</a>, the 7600X3D ends up at 2.7 FPS/W, which is an awesome result that we didn’t expect to see. The 9800X3D is alongside it at the top, roughly tied with the 7800X3D at 2.3 to 2.4 FPS/W. This is a strong start. And for the 7600, that landed at 1.6 FPS per watt, which puts it above the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B08166SLDF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5600X</a>, below the 5800X3D, and predictably above the 7600X, but it’s still below the 7600X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4980\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"75cce88b-cda3-4691-ba23-c176e4589c20\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail also has insanely efficient performance. The CPU is, once again, not the best performer on the charts, but it encroaches on the top and manages to do so while at 34W during this benchmark. Because the power is so much lower overall, the efficiency climbs despite a reduction in max FPS versus better AMD parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end result is a 10.3 FPS/W rating, the highest we’ve seen, against 8.3 FPS/W on the 7800X3D. The 7800X3D is reaching the upper bound of what it can achieve for performance: It’s possible that this number increases with the launch of the RTX 5090, but for now, it’s stuck at 8.3 FPS/W. The 7600X original part pulls a little more power and performs far worse, landing it down at 5.6 FPS/W. That’s still ahead of anything Intel has to offer, including the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-245K/dp/B0DFK2P311?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">245K</a> at 4.3 FPS/W, but nowhere close to the 7600X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stellaris</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20v3.13-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4981\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"89f78a4d-d0a4-4bf5-b30d-386b135d5afa\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Stellaris, the 7600X3D required 33.1 seconds to complete the simulation. This reduces the time required from the 7600X’s 36-second entry by 8%. The 9600X, from Zen 5, outperforms the 7600X3D, benefiting from the overall Zen 5 uplift we’ve seen in this specific game. Aside from that, everything else above the 7600X3D is significantly more expensive, including the 285K at $630 but providing only a 1.8% reduction in time required to simulate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>), the 7600X3D sees a 14% reduction in time required. The same is true compared to the 5600X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 9800X3D is aided hugely by its architecture and frequency, requiring 22% less time than the 7600X3D. The 7800X3D benefits from a 5.4% reduction in time required. Overall, the 7600X3D encroaches on the 7800X3D while being significantly lower cost, but can’t come close to the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Dragon%27s%20Dogma%202%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4982\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"04d9008f-e18b-49e5-85ad-5f7750d32d4b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is up now. This is another title where the 9800X3D saw strong performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this game, the 9800X3D holds a 21% lead over the 7600X3D in average FPS, at about 129 FPS to 106. The lows are proportional to the increase in average FPS. There is no particularly abnormal advantage to those found on the 9800X3D, although they are good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the 5700X3D’s 103 FPS AVG, the 7600X3D holds a small 3.1% lead. It’s 3.5% ahead of the prior generation 5600X3D, which was also Microcenter-exclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Intel, key comparisons include the 245K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-core-ultra-5-245k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5700x3d-13700k-more\">our review</a>) at 95 FPS AVG and priced similarly to the 7600X3D. This gives the 7600X3D a 12% advantage in average FPS over the new 245K, with lows again proportionally higher. The i7 and i9 CPUs from the 13th and 14th series are all roughly tied with the 7600X3D, but slightly ahead. The 5800X3D maintains its position at the top of this grouping, beaten only by its newer alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Starfield</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Starfield%20_%201080p_Low%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_7.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4983\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"190a7d09-132f-49e0-85c6-5113da705f48\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Starfield is up now. This was another strong one for the 9800X3D when we reviewed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, the 7600X3D ran at 122 FPS AVG. That means the 9800X3D’s 169 FPS result has it about 38% ahead of the 7600X3D, a significant jaunt. The 7800X3D ran at 145 FPS AVG, offering its own improvement of 19% over the 7600X3D. The 7600X3D is definitely a lower-end part than the two flagships. Compared to the 5700X3D though, the 7600X3D is technically improved -- though basically within error at 3.2% uplift. The 5600X3D gives the 7600X3D a lead of 8.2%, widening the gap in favor of the newer Micro Center-exclusive part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s showing includes the 245K at about the same framerate and a similar price, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-12900K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B09FXDLX95?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">12900K</a> at a higher framerate, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13600K-LGA1700-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0BG63WLG3?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">13600K</a> also ahead. The 7600X3D is stunted by a combination of its lower core count and its frequency, not able to leverage the cache to the same extent as the higher-end AMD X3D parts. The 7600X3D at least holds about a 20% uplift over the 7600X, which was down at 102 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_7.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4984\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"815a457d-179e-448a-822f-c838789fc2ad\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Baldur’s Gate 3, the 9800X3D experienced a large performance boost that we spent several minutes digging into in its review. It’s an outlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D is more typical: It ran the game at 116 FPS AVG, which allows the 9800X3D another 38% lead. The lows remain impressive on the 9800X3D, followed by the prior 13 series and 14 series CPUs as the next most impressive for lows. The 7600X3D is overall “fine” for lows, but its position is predictable within this stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D posted a 126 FPS AVG in Baldur’s Gate, giving it a boost of 9% for the extra $180 or so -- that doesn’t seem worth it if you have a Micro Center near you. The 5700X3D remains pretty close by as well, with a 111 FPS AVG that would be indistinguishable from the results of the 7600X3D. The 5700X3D also benefits from a fiercely competitive price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 245K slips down this chart, especially with Windows 24H2. It’s at 93 FPS AVG, giving the 7600X3D a 25% lead in average FPS. Lows are about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FFXIV Dawntrail</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20Benchmark%20v1-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_7.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4985\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"fa544141-b87f-434c-8cc5-ddeefaf6bb73\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is next. This one has the 7600X3D at 349 FPS AVG with lows at 164 and 79 FPS. That positions it roughly tied with the 7800X3D, both of which appear to be encountering similar limits. The 9800X3D managed to break free of this bind and post a 373 FPS result. That’s good, but it’s not as impressive as we saw in other tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this isn’t meant to be another review of the 9800X3D. The 7600X3D boosts over the 7600X’s 259 FPS AVG by 35%, leading the 259 FPS entry by a significant margin. X3D in general completely divides this chart, forming a rift below the 5600X3D and everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s closest competitor is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i9-14900K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJDKLB8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14900K</a>, although it’s more expensive, up at 310 FPS AVG. The 7600X3D leads even the former flagship i9 by 13%. Its lead over the 5700X3D is noteworthy, at 16%. This is because of the 5700X3D’s drop in clocks, which we know to impact its Final Fantasy performance. That’s also why the 5600X3D runs higher performance: Its clocks are typically at least 300 MHz higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Rainbow%20Six%20Siege%20_%201080p_VHigh%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4986\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"08f6e51b-6ba9-43fb-bcaa-1f93c4ad1dce\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Rainbow Six Siege is up now. In this one, the 7600X3D ran at 613 FPS AVG -- sorry, 613.3… That 0.3 is important, because elite FPS gamers can see even the difference between 0.000798 ms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 613.3 FPS result has it up alongside the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NN6TM7?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9600X</a> and below the 9700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">our review</a>). The 7800X3D ran at 622 FPS AVG -- again, sorry, 622.1 -- which means it holds a 1.4% lead. That’s basically error. These CPUs are functionally the same, with lows differentiated only by how wildly variable this particular game is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the 5700X3D, the lead from the 7600X3D is a more noteworthy 17%. There’s also a big jump over the 245K, way down at 476 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally though, the top CPUs are mostly the same. The 9800X3D is boosted, but not in a huge way like in some other games. We’re up against limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>F1 24</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20F1%2024%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_5.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4987\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"55f12626-759b-4979-8f89-6a9d9cbd37d3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In F1 24, the 7600X3D ran at about 409 FPS AVG and was flanked by the 5800X3D and 7800X3D. The 7800X3D holds a 7.2% lead in average FPS, with a big jump in the 1% and 0.1% lows. Both are ultimately acceptable. The 5800X3D’s 391 FPS average gave up a 4.4% lead to the 7600X3D. The gap against the 7600X is massive, at 409 FPS to 312 FPS, or a 31% uplift for the 7600X3D. That’s a big climb when considering the frequency and cache changes discussed earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s 245K is far down the chart, more similar to the 7600X than the newer X3D variant. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/owcaa4rq7gtkj\">14900K</a> is closer, but still behind at 385 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Total War: Warhammer 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Total%20War_%20Warhammer%20III%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4988\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"18a4df9c-7306-4ff6-9693-f638dad53afb\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Total War: Warhammer 3, the 7600X3D ran at 484 FPS AVG. That has it in the top grouping again, but technically behind the 14700K. Realistically, in average FPS, they’re the same; however, the X3D CPUs all have large advantages in frametime consistency and pacing, as illustrated by the 1% and 0.1% lows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D and 7800X3D are both encountering external limits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real takeaway though is that Intel continues to get bodied by X3D: the 265K and 285K both suffer from the same impact we saw to the 14900K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intels-300w-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>) and 13900K, where frametime consistency plummets and large frametime spikes pop-up more frequently. This affects the averaging as well, since it drags everything down, which leads to the 285K and 265K seeming to perform worse than a lower thread-count 245K. This is a repeatable result. Even the DDR5-8600 285K entry has worse lows than the 245K, and that’s all because of scheduling. There are community mods to try and help with this, but we test games as the developer ships and maintains them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7600x3d-production-benchmarks\">AMD R5 7600X3D <strong>Production Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Production workloads aren’t a big focus for R5 CPUs, so we’ll fly through these to hit the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Blender</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Blender%204.2-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4989\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7db5084d-8eea-4d97-94b6-e64d52f0d23e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Blender 3D rendering on the CPU, the 7600X3D required 21.3 minutes to complete a frame of the GN intro animation. This is one of the slower results, putting it in-line with the 5700X3D, 3700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-r7-3700x-r5-3600-2024-revisit-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-5700x3d-more\">our revisit</a>), and 5800X. The 7600X is faster than the 7600X3D, which isn’t new behavior: While the 9800X3D actually outperformed the 9700X, generally speaking, X3D CPUs are worse in production-heavy, all-core tasks than the CPUs they stack the cache on top of. That’s because the frequency comes down on prior generations, mostly for thermal budget reasons, and this is also why Zen 5 X3D is so interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the 7600X3D, we’re back to a situation where it’d typically make more sense to buy any other CPU above it on the chart for heavy workstation use cases that we test. If you’re building a machine that’s gaming-focused first and foremost, then the 7600X3D should still be in consideration. It’s capable of handling production-style work on the side, but there are better options for a build more purely focused on that kind of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D is beaten by the <a href=\"https://howl.link/hfqdzdn8beg14\">12600K</a>, 5800X, and many other CPUs. Blender scales cleanly with thread count, and that shows here. The 285K is also relatively competitive in this particular test, as are the 265K and 245K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Chromium</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Chromium%20Code%20Compile%20%28Windows%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4990\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9172fe31-106c-482e-87ee-17ecedc8bccf\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Chromium code compile, the 7600X3D required 208 minutes to complete the compile.

The 7600X3D is struggling with its thread deficit and just wasn’t built to excel at the production applications we test with. Even the 3700X isn’t distant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X benefits from a time reduction to 198 minutes in this test, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/pm8g2szvsexz3\">9600X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-12600K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B09FX4D72T?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">12600K</a> ahead of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4991\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a9d6b0f3-be87-46c0-9064-ed60d9b80e8b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In 7-Zip file compression, the 7600X3D ended up completing about 87K MIPS, putting it ahead of the 3700X and behind the 5700X3D.

The part is acceptable for its price if gaming is the primary focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4992\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ad8cca00-77fd-4bcf-95b0-9ddc2b067289\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Decompression is similar: The 3700X outmatches the 7600X3D marginally, the 7600X3D is just ahead of the 12600K (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkHMh8sUSuM\">our review</a>) now, and the 7600X non-3D runs 8.8% faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D stood out here as improving on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0D6NMDNNX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9700X</a>, benefitted by its higher power budget that enables higher boosting. We covered this in the <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/rip-intel-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-285k-14900k-more\">review</a>.

The result is in aggregate points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D scored 7832 points, which has the 7600X ahead of it by 4.2% at 8159. Next above that is the 12600K. The 245K posts a significant gain over the 7600X3D here as well. Against prior parts, the 7600X3D at least improves upon the 5700X3D and 5600X3D components in a more noticeable way. It’s just not impressive on its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Adobe%20Photoshop%20%28Puget%20Suite%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4994\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2ae6b9cf-52b9-4851-9d35-855e21f6ea05\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Adobe Photoshop and tested with Puget Suite again, the 7600X3D fell down the charts to 14600K levels of performance and functionally tied with the 245K. That’s an OK spot to be, but AMD dominates the top half of this chart with other components -- including the 7600X. The reason for this drop comes down to the loss in frequency, which is important to Photoshop right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7600x3d-conclusion\"><strong>AMD R5 7600X3D Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content1b9cc693-512e-44c3-813b-acd6b2191386\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-3d-emblem-glasses\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn15-glass-hero_red-1000x489.jpg.webp?itok=dZEUQV_3\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-734\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ef1b7acd-3fff-4e55-bdc2-ca0cc3f79f14\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-3d-emblem-glasses\">fully custom 3D Emblem Glasses</a> celebrate our 15th Anniversary!

That’s great, but most people -- especially in this part of the market -- don’t buy on efficiency. From a pure performance standpoint, we get the expected Zen 4 behaviors: The 7600X3D is a little worse in production than its non-X3D counterpart in most of our non-gaming tests, but is far superior in gaming tests. Because an R5, like an “Ultra” 5, is targeted at gaming, that’s the most important aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance achieves most of what the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rvofm7t5soxde\">7800X3D</a> would have to offer, but at $300. For gaming, it’s a better option than Intel’s $300 options, especially over the new <a href=\"https://howl.link/cgpjdm7qfh3lx\">245K</a> at $320, but worse in non-gaming tasks. If you’re mostly playing games and have a budget limited to about $300 on the CPU, we think the 7600X3D makes good sense. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/vg2vxbemfkb9w\">9800X3D</a> offers a meaningful uplift at $480, but is also a huge jump in price and that extra money would possibly be better spent on a better GPU to unlock more performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-18-16h40m09s747.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4995\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b03ba28a-ee7b-4551-96ea-3bb0d4d06406\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p><br />The 7600X3D’s biggest strength is its impressive efficiency. Its biggest weakness is its core count, where non-gaming tasks will be restrained. For users who tend to mix heavier “work” applications than gaming, we’d encourage considering other options to better suit those needs. Our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/rip-intel-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-285k-14900k-more\">9800X3D review</a> goes into some of that. But for gaming-first users near a Micro Center, the 7600X3D performs overall well.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

It’s a 6-core, 12-thread X3D part that we bought for $300 from Micro Center in Charlotte. AMD didn’t email us about this CPU, didn’t do review sampling, and just sort of quietly launched it to the market through Micro Center. It’s similar to the 5600X3D launch (read our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-5600x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-last-chance-upgrade\">review here</a>). <br />This runs on Zen 4 and is advertised as having a maximum 4.7 GHz boost clock and 4.1 GHz base clock. TDP is listed at 65W. AMD’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7600X-12-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBJDS62N?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7600X</a> has a higher 105W TDP and runs an advertised maximum clock of 5.3 GHz, or 4.7 GHz base. That’ll make the <a href=\"https://howl.link/jcnlim8g2urfc\">7600X</a> better in some specific frequency-constrained scenarios that can’t utilize the extra cache, like in our non-gaming tests, but it’ll also make it more power hungry and having that extra cache normally allows better performance in gaming, even if the frequency is lower, and it tends to be more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on November 7, 2024 as a video.

The 9800X3D we just reviewed ran at about 5225 MHz average, which is an impressive clock to hold for a 3D V-Cache part. It’s also a flat hold of the frequency thanks to the extra power budget. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a> fluctuates more due to the power constraint, holding around 4850 MHz on average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D comes in below that, at 4700 to 4730 MHz, also moving up and down through the test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For perspective, the 7600X non-3D part ran at about the same clock as the 9800X3D, up around 5225 MHz. If you see the 7600X outperform the 7600X3D in some tests, that won’t be a surprise: Anything which relies less on the extra cache than on higher clocks will see a regression in performance. This is less prevalent on the Zen 5 9800X3D due to its higher power budget and because the <a href=\"https://howl.link/2oalvlmsuv4qd\">9700X</a> had a lower power budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>AMD R5 7600X3D Single-Core Frequency</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frequency%20Comparison%20%28Max%201T%20in%20CB%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4978\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dd4e1713-3a34-47a5-9159-f65af65b430b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This chart is for the maximum single-core boost during a Cinebench single-threaded workload. This allows us to see how fast the cores go when unlikely to breach power limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D we just reviewed held the same 5225 MHz clock we saw in all-core testing and did so throughout the benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D ran faster than its all-core workload, which is more typical. That had it at 5050 MHz during this test on the fastest core per interval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D is far slower than that, with a comparatively huge drop to 4750 MHz for the fastest single core per interval. That’s a large drop that will likely contribute to losses in certain titles, maybe like Final Fantasy, more than the core count difference between the two would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X ran at 5450 MHz for the fastest single core, which will also benefit it in lightly threaded scenarios where the extra cache doesn’t contribute much.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

It’s the new most-efficient CPU in our testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our efficiency benchmarks are a combination of both power drawn during the test and the performance output in the test, which is FPS in this situation. Tweaking either dial can improve efficiency since it’s a calculation of the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D ended up at 42.8W in this test, which has it reduced from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a>, 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>), and 7800X3D. It’s among the lowest power draw parts in this test, alongside the older R7 2700. With the 12W reduction from the 7800X3D and with performance similar to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/yigii3hjbqih9\">5700X3D</a>, the 7600X3D ends up at 2.7 FPS/W, which is an awesome result that we didn’t expect to see. The 9800X3D is alongside it at the top, roughly tied with the 7800X3D at 2.3 to 2.4 FPS/W. This is a strong start. And for the 7600, that landed at 1.6 FPS per watt, which puts it above the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B08166SLDF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5600X</a>, below the 5800X3D, and predictably above the 7600X, but it’s still below the 7600X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4980\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"75cce88b-cda3-4691-ba23-c176e4589c20\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail also has insanely efficient performance. The CPU is, once again, not the best performer on the charts, but it encroaches on the top and manages to do so while at 34W during this benchmark. Because the power is so much lower overall, the efficiency climbs despite a reduction in max FPS versus better AMD parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end result is a 10.3 FPS/W rating, the highest we’ve seen, against 8.3 FPS/W on the 7800X3D. The 7800X3D is reaching the upper bound of what it can achieve for performance: It’s possible that this number increases with the launch of the RTX 5090, but for now, it’s stuck at 8.3 FPS/W. The 7600X original part pulls a little more power and performs far worse, landing it down at 5.6 FPS/W. That’s still ahead of anything Intel has to offer, including the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-245K/dp/B0DFK2P311?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">245K</a> at 4.3 FPS/W, but nowhere close to the 7600X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stellaris</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20v3.13-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4981\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"89f78a4d-d0a4-4bf5-b30d-386b135d5afa\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Stellaris, the 7600X3D required 33.1 seconds to complete the simulation. This reduces the time required from the 7600X’s 36-second entry by 8%. The 9600X, from Zen 5, outperforms the 7600X3D, benefiting from the overall Zen 5 uplift we’ve seen in this specific game. Aside from that, everything else above the 7600X3D is significantly more expensive, including the 285K at $630 but providing only a 1.8% reduction in time required to simulate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>), the 7600X3D sees a 14% reduction in time required. The same is true compared to the 5600X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 9800X3D is aided hugely by its architecture and frequency, requiring 22% less time than the 7600X3D. The 7800X3D benefits from a 5.4% reduction in time required. Overall, the 7600X3D encroaches on the 7800X3D while being significantly lower cost, but can’t come close to the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Dragon%27s%20Dogma%202%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4982\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"04d9008f-e18b-49e5-85ad-5f7750d32d4b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is up now. This is another title where the 9800X3D saw strong performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this game, the 9800X3D holds a 21% lead over the 7600X3D in average FPS, at about 129 FPS to 106. The lows are proportional to the increase in average FPS. There is no particularly abnormal advantage to those found on the 9800X3D, although they are good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the 5700X3D’s 103 FPS AVG, the 7600X3D holds a small 3.1% lead. It’s 3.5% ahead of the prior generation 5600X3D, which was also Microcenter-exclusive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Intel, key comparisons include the 245K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-core-ultra-5-245k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5700x3d-13700k-more\">our review</a>) at 95 FPS AVG and priced similarly to the 7600X3D. This gives the 7600X3D a 12% advantage in average FPS over the new 245K, with lows again proportionally higher. The i7 and i9 CPUs from the 13th and 14th series are all roughly tied with the 7600X3D, but slightly ahead. The 5800X3D maintains its position at the top of this grouping, beaten only by its newer alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Starfield</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Starfield%20_%201080p_Low%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_7.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4983\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"190a7d09-132f-49e0-85c6-5113da705f48\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Starfield is up now. This was another strong one for the 9800X3D when we reviewed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, the 7600X3D ran at 122 FPS AVG. That means the 9800X3D’s 169 FPS result has it about 38% ahead of the 7600X3D, a significant jaunt. The 7800X3D ran at 145 FPS AVG, offering its own improvement of 19% over the 7600X3D. The 7600X3D is definitely a lower-end part than the two flagships. Compared to the 5700X3D though, the 7600X3D is technically improved -- though basically within error at 3.2% uplift. The 5600X3D gives the 7600X3D a lead of 8.2%, widening the gap in favor of the newer Micro Center-exclusive part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s showing includes the 245K at about the same framerate and a similar price, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-12900K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B09FXDLX95?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">12900K</a> at a higher framerate, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13600K-LGA1700-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0BG63WLG3?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">13600K</a> also ahead. The 7600X3D is stunted by a combination of its lower core count and its frequency, not able to leverage the cache to the same extent as the higher-end AMD X3D parts. The 7600X3D at least holds about a 20% uplift over the 7600X, which was down at 102 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_7.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4984\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"815a457d-179e-448a-822f-c838789fc2ad\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Baldur’s Gate 3, the 9800X3D experienced a large performance boost that we spent several minutes digging into in its review. It’s an outlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D is more typical: It ran the game at 116 FPS AVG, which allows the 9800X3D another 38% lead. The lows remain impressive on the 9800X3D, followed by the prior 13 series and 14 series CPUs as the next most impressive for lows. The 7600X3D is overall “fine” for lows, but its position is predictable within this stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D posted a 126 FPS AVG in Baldur’s Gate, giving it a boost of 9% for the extra $180 or so -- that doesn’t seem worth it if you have a Micro Center near you. The 5700X3D remains pretty close by as well, with a 111 FPS AVG that would be indistinguishable from the results of the 7600X3D. The 5700X3D also benefits from a fiercely competitive price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 245K slips down this chart, especially with Windows 24H2. It’s at 93 FPS AVG, giving the 7600X3D a 25% lead in average FPS. Lows are about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FFXIV Dawntrail</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20Benchmark%20v1-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_7.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4985\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"fa544141-b87f-434c-8cc5-ddeefaf6bb73\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is next. This one has the 7600X3D at 349 FPS AVG with lows at 164 and 79 FPS. That positions it roughly tied with the 7800X3D, both of which appear to be encountering similar limits. The 9800X3D managed to break free of this bind and post a 373 FPS result. That’s good, but it’s not as impressive as we saw in other tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this isn’t meant to be another review of the 9800X3D. The 7600X3D boosts over the 7600X’s 259 FPS AVG by 35%, leading the 259 FPS entry by a significant margin. X3D in general completely divides this chart, forming a rift below the 5600X3D and everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s closest competitor is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i9-14900K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJDKLB8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14900K</a>, although it’s more expensive, up at 310 FPS AVG. The 7600X3D leads even the former flagship i9 by 13%. Its lead over the 5700X3D is noteworthy, at 16%. This is because of the 5700X3D’s drop in clocks, which we know to impact its Final Fantasy performance. That’s also why the 5600X3D runs higher performance: Its clocks are typically at least 300 MHz higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Rainbow%20Six%20Siege%20_%201080p_VHigh%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4986\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"08f6e51b-6ba9-43fb-bcaa-1f93c4ad1dce\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Rainbow Six Siege is up now. In this one, the 7600X3D ran at 613 FPS AVG -- sorry, 613.3… That 0.3 is important, because elite FPS gamers can see even the difference between 0.000798 ms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 613.3 FPS result has it up alongside the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NN6TM7?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9600X</a> and below the 9700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">our review</a>). The 7800X3D ran at 622 FPS AVG -- again, sorry, 622.1 -- which means it holds a 1.4% lead. That’s basically error. These CPUs are functionally the same, with lows differentiated only by how wildly variable this particular game is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the 5700X3D, the lead from the 7600X3D is a more noteworthy 17%. There’s also a big jump over the 245K, way down at 476 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally though, the top CPUs are mostly the same. The 9800X3D is boosted, but not in a huge way like in some other games. We’re up against limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>F1 24</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20F1%2024%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_5.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4987\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"55f12626-759b-4979-8f89-6a9d9cbd37d3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In F1 24, the 7600X3D ran at about 409 FPS AVG and was flanked by the 5800X3D and 7800X3D. The 7800X3D holds a 7.2% lead in average FPS, with a big jump in the 1% and 0.1% lows. Both are ultimately acceptable. The 5800X3D’s 391 FPS average gave up a 4.4% lead to the 7600X3D. The gap against the 7600X is massive, at 409 FPS to 312 FPS, or a 31% uplift for the 7600X3D. That’s a big climb when considering the frequency and cache changes discussed earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s 245K is far down the chart, more similar to the 7600X than the newer X3D variant. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/owcaa4rq7gtkj\">14900K</a> is closer, but still behind at 385 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Total War: Warhammer 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Total%20War_%20Warhammer%20III%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4988\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"18a4df9c-7306-4ff6-9693-f638dad53afb\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Total War: Warhammer 3, the 7600X3D ran at 484 FPS AVG. That has it in the top grouping again, but technically behind the 14700K. Realistically, in average FPS, they’re the same; however, the X3D CPUs all have large advantages in frametime consistency and pacing, as illustrated by the 1% and 0.1% lows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D and 7800X3D are both encountering external limits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real takeaway though is that Intel continues to get bodied by X3D: the 265K and 285K both suffer from the same impact we saw to the 14900K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intels-300w-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>) and 13900K, where frametime consistency plummets and large frametime spikes pop-up more frequently. This affects the averaging as well, since it drags everything down, which leads to the 285K and 265K seeming to perform worse than a lower thread-count 245K. This is a repeatable result. Even the DDR5-8600 285K entry has worse lows than the 245K, and that’s all because of scheduling. There are community mods to try and help with this, but we test games as the developer ships and maintains them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7600x3d-production-benchmarks\">AMD R5 7600X3D <strong>Production Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Production workloads aren’t a big focus for R5 CPUs, so we’ll fly through these to hit the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Blender</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Blender%204.2-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4989\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7db5084d-8eea-4d97-94b6-e64d52f0d23e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Blender 3D rendering on the CPU, the 7600X3D required 21.3 minutes to complete a frame of the GN intro animation. This is one of the slower results, putting it in-line with the 5700X3D, 3700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-r7-3700x-r5-3600-2024-revisit-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-5700x3d-more\">our revisit</a>), and 5800X. The 7600X is faster than the 7600X3D, which isn’t new behavior: While the 9800X3D actually outperformed the 9700X, generally speaking, X3D CPUs are worse in production-heavy, all-core tasks than the CPUs they stack the cache on top of. That’s because the frequency comes down on prior generations, mostly for thermal budget reasons, and this is also why Zen 5 X3D is so interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the 7600X3D, we’re back to a situation where it’d typically make more sense to buy any other CPU above it on the chart for heavy workstation use cases that we test. If you’re building a machine that’s gaming-focused first and foremost, then the 7600X3D should still be in consideration. It’s capable of handling production-style work on the side, but there are better options for a build more purely focused on that kind of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D is beaten by the <a href=\"https://howl.link/hfqdzdn8beg14\">12600K</a>, 5800X, and many other CPUs. Blender scales cleanly with thread count, and that shows here. The 285K is also relatively competitive in this particular test, as are the 265K and 245K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Chromium</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Chromium%20Code%20Compile%20%28Windows%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4990\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9172fe31-106c-482e-87ee-17ecedc8bccf\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Chromium code compile, the 7600X3D required 208 minutes to complete the compile.

The 7600X3D is struggling with its thread deficit and just wasn’t built to excel at the production applications we test with. Even the 3700X isn’t distant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X benefits from a time reduction to 198 minutes in this test, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/pm8g2szvsexz3\">9600X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-12600K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B09FX4D72T?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">12600K</a> ahead of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4991\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a9d6b0f3-be87-46c0-9064-ed60d9b80e8b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In 7-Zip file compression, the 7600X3D ended up completing about 87K MIPS, putting it ahead of the 3700X and behind the 5700X3D. The 7600X is again better, at 91K MIPS, or improved by 5.2%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with other pre-Zen 5 X3D parts, if doing this kind of work heavily, it’d make more sense to buy something else.

The result is in aggregate points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7600X3D scored 7832 points, which has the 7600X ahead of it by 4.2% at 8159. Next above that is the 12600K. The 245K posts a significant gain over the 7600X3D here as well. Against prior parts, the 7600X3D at least improves upon the 5700X3D and 5600X3D components in a more noticeable way. It’s just not impressive on its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Adobe%20Photoshop%20%28Puget%20Suite%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4994\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2ae6b9cf-52b9-4851-9d35-855e21f6ea05\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Adobe Photoshop and tested with Puget Suite again, the 7600X3D fell down the charts to 14600K levels of performance and functionally tied with the 245K. That’s an OK spot to be, but AMD dominates the top half of this chart with other components -- including the 7600X. The reason for this drop comes down to the loss in frequency, which is important to Photoshop right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7600x3d-conclusion\"><strong>AMD R5 7600X3D Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content1b9cc693-512e-44c3-813b-acd6b2191386\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-3d-emblem-glasses\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn15-glass-hero_red-1000x489.jpg.webp?itok=dZEUQV_3\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-734\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ef1b7acd-3fff-4e55-bdc2-ca0cc3f79f14\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-3d-emblem-glasses\">fully custom 3D Emblem Glasses</a> celebrate our 15th Anniversary!

That’s great, but most people -- especially in this part of the market -- don’t buy on efficiency. From a pure performance standpoint, we get the expected Zen 4 behaviors: The 7600X3D is a little worse in production than its non-X3D counterpart in most of our non-gaming tests, but is far superior in gaming tests. Because an R5, like an “Ultra” 5, is targeted at gaming, that’s the most important aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance achieves most of what the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rvofm7t5soxde\">7800X3D</a> would have to offer, but at $300. For gaming, it’s a better option than Intel’s $300 options, especially over the new <a href=\"https://howl.link/cgpjdm7qfh3lx\">245K</a> at $320, but worse in non-gaming tasks. If you’re mostly playing games and have a budget limited to about $300 on the CPU, we think the 7600X3D makes good sense. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/vg2vxbemfkb9w\">9800X3D</a> offers a meaningful uplift at $480, but is also a huge jump in price and that extra money would possibly be better spent on a better GPU to unlock more performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-18-16h40m09s747.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4995\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b03ba28a-ee7b-4551-96ea-3bb0d4d06406\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p><br />The 7600X3D’s biggest strength is its impressive efficiency. Its biggest weakness is its core count, where non-gaming tasks will be restrained. For users who tend to mix heavier “work” applications than gaming, we’d encourage considering other options to better suit those needs. Our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/rip-intel-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-285k-14900k-more\">9800X3D review</a> goes into some of that. But for gaming-first users near a Micro Center, the 7600X3D performs overall well.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

HAVN's case focuses on trying to innovate on cooling performance. In the vertical GPU orientation, the bottom-mounted fans install at an angle and direct the air towards the glass and use an included glass flow guide to direct the air away from the GPU. That might seem counter-intuitive, but this will be easier to explain using our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v7aRWcM0AFE?t=625\">3D animation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAVN -- that’s the name of the brand for this case -- is separating the hot exhaust air out the bottom of the GPU from the cooler intake, pushing intake at the glass side panel of the case and almost sort of “bouncing” it into the front of the video card. There are trade-offs, but it’s a novel approach for a case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on October 17, 2024 as a video.

CaseKing is one of the largest computer hardware retailers in Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HAVN HS420 is $200, with the HAVN HS420 VGPU at $270.

We used to do these a lot for major case launches, but we’re basically testing a ton of alternative configurations in addition to the 6 or 7 we did for this review. That’ll be a separate story later since it requires a ton of additional testing. But for now, we still went heavy on configuration testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAVN says its team members include people with experience from Fractal, NZXT, Cooler Master, Sapphire, and others.

The shortest and most direct path to the GPU would be flat fans on the bottom pointed straight at the video card, but that path would sort of “collide” with the hot exhaust coming out of the bottom of the card. This designed and angled path tries to almost “bounce” the air off of the glass or flow it out and nearby, at which point the video card fans will pull that air in.

The glass attaches to the back of the angled fan tray. This flow guide will push cool air at the glass side panel, at which point it’ll either physically deflect or will be overpowered and pulled-in by the GPU’s own fans. Likewise, hot air exiting the GPU bottom out of vertically oriented fins will now get shoved behind the glass and behind the fan tray. The back of the fan tray is fully enclosed by steel and glass, so there won’t be any hot air ingress. The glass shroud walls the hot air off.

We’ll come back to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This results in the intake air now making multiple turns, which will affect both air velocity and air pressure: Velocity will decrease at the point it enters the GPU fans as a result of the turns and indirect path. Because the fans themselves are angled, the air ends up making close to a 90-degree turn -- shallower than if they were flat in the bottom with a flow guide, but still a big change in direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h39m03s490.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4925\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8bb3ec6b-fb7e-41c9-96f2-0ddff17043d9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The glass shroud itself has two points where it bends and a straight section: The first is a 40-degree angle, then about a 50-degree angle.

Because it endeavors to compete with the best cases on our charts, we needed to see if it could actually beat the best. We decided to standardize against a set of fans from one of the best cases on the charts: The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Antec Flux Pro</a>, which comes with 6 fans and has held the #1 rank in some tests recently. We pulled all 6 of its fans (4x 140, which is perfect for the bottom intake configuration and 2x 120 reverse blade), which allows us to make a direct head-to-head comparison. We’ve noted for a long time the limitations of our standardized fan test methods in cases, so for this review, we decided to experiment. We might start instead standardizing against a case that competes in a similar class, which would give fewer individual case reference points, but allow us to test against head-to-head competition in a controlled way with the same fans in a more optimized setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Test Configurations</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So this marks sort of a new trial in our case reviews.

Remember, the budget is 6 fans to match the leading Flux Pro, so we stopped there for now. For this, we experimented with variations on the single 140mm fan in the top, moving it either in front of the cooler as intake or behind it as exhaust.

The best CPU performer was B2, which has a horizontal GPU, side intake fans, rear exhaust, and the top fan arranged as CPU tower intake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s move to individual data for inspection with just the HAVN case first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Only: GPU Thermals at 100%</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20HAVN%20Configs%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4950\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"719236fe-3365-410d-963f-b236e9fbe3fc\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s the chart for GPU thermals at full speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The total spread is 4.6 degrees, which is actually pretty wide for GPU thermal differences in our testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with the glass flow guide: Our direct comparison of A1 vs. A2 has identical setup aside from the guide. On the chart, A1 with the angled fans and glass shroud performed the worst, with A2 performing 1.8 degrees better for GPU average temperature. That’s a real difference and outside of expected variance. A2 is identical but removes the glass shroud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best performer for the GPU was a horizontal GPU and side intake with B3. This isn’t too surprising. Horizontal GPUs often breathe better, but if you truly wanted a vertical GPU for display, our best-performing vertical setup was B1, which uses side intake, a top intake fan in front of the CPU cooler, and two rear exhaust fans. A3 is next, this time with 3x bottom intake fans but mounted flat rather than in the angled tray. This is a direct comparison to A1 and A2 without any changes. In our testing, it appears that the special bracket for the bottom fans and all the complicated curves and turns and glass are hindering performance. This makes sense. Air shooting straight in and without reroutes is just performing better with A3. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Only: CPU Thermals at 100%</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20HAVN%20Configs%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4951\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"73b64f2e-57b4-4ab4-9707-4cf8c34230f5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Looking at CPU thermals in detail: Configurations B2, B1, and A3 are functionally identical. A3 with the flush-mounted bottom intake fans did better for the CPU than those where the fans were angled at the glass. Config A2 was about 2 degrees worse than B2, so the total spread here is largely inconsequential. It’d make more sense to choose based on GPU performance than CPU tower performance between these configurations. Side intake is favored.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Only: VRM & RAM Thermals at 100%</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28VRM_RAM%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20HAVN%20Configs%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4952\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a32ad22a-4ee0-41e5-be1e-406f627d7a6b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>For VRM and memory thermals, there’s another relatively wide spread of about 6 degrees on system memory. B1 runs at 13 degrees over ambient for DDR5, which is impressive. B3 runs at 19 degrees over ambient -- totally fine, but 6 degrees warmer shows an inefficiency. The cooler result benefits from an intake fan immediately above the RAM and VRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to get into the competitive benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Thermals: Full Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20Stock%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4953\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f693bce2-9990-467d-94a3-3e49c5031e5f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This chart is for GPU thermals with the fans at full speed. We’ve removed all configs for the HAVN case except the best and worst. You can find the full HAVN data in the prior charts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, remember that the HAVN case does not include fans. Because of this, its performance is basically whatever we want it to be, based on fans we choose. We normalized to the Antec Flux Pro, so that’s our direct comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Flux Pro wins. Antec’s thermals are superior for the GPU while maintaining roughly equivalent noise levels, functionally noise-normalizing HAVN for the Flux Pro. The HAVN case still does well and ranks right alongside the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-Tempered-High-Airflow-Computer/dp/B09XQS5GJN?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Torrent</a>, which has remained an impressive show of force for Fractal. It’s just that HAVN isn’t dominating the charts as much as we’d have liked for a case so thoughtfully focused on new approaches to fan placement. It’s a good start, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A1 has the bottom intake bracket and VGPU and landed lower down the chart. We’d favor the horizontal GPU solution. The HS420 HGPU B3 is outperforming the <a href=\"https://howl.link/j290ga3xr7qj8\">Antec C8</a>, but only slightly outperforming the Hyte Y70 with half the fan count.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Thermals: Full Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20Stock%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4954\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f659775a-38da-4c55-983d-97de32a89392\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>For CPU thermals, we’ve added B2 to this chart as it was the best for CPU performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At full fan speed, the HAVN with the best configuration we’ve tested so far landed functionally tied with the Flux Pro using its alternate PSU mount. Noise levels are about the same. This has the HAVN HS420 led by the Flux Pro with standard PSU orientation, the 216, and 207. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-North-Charcoal-Black/dp/B0CJCJ3ZZB?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">North XL</a> is also about tied with the HS420, but is much louder at 45 dBA, where these HS420 configs land closer to 39-40dBA. The Antec comparison is the most relevant since the fans are identical.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"havn-hs420-conclusion\"><strong>HAVN HS420 Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

It’s sad to see it not do better with all the special tuning, but looking back at our emails, even the HAVN team itself thought that the horizontal GPU configuration would do better in our testing. They were right. The vertical GPU setup, as fancy as it is, is still about balancing looks. Vertical GPUs are often disadvantaged, and HAVN hasn’t defeated that here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thermals are our focus. From a pure thermal performance standpoint, HAVN has not become the new best on the charts. The ideas are there, and for a first case, they got close -- but it is beaten by cheaper cases on this front.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-14h07m57s619.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4955\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6632a14c-00ea-470b-a15f-dcc35c2f67d1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Cases aren’t all about thermals, though.

align with the hubs and edges of top-mounted fans, minimizing overlap with the fan blades. The right side panel does the same, intentionally aligning the blockages from structural elements with the dead zones on the fans. This is awesome attention to detail that we don’t commonly see. There are protective rubber dampers on everything: on the screws and the tabs that attach the fan trays to the case, on the 120mm adapters for the rear fans, on the posts that the bottom fan mounts rest on, on the airflow shield, and under a fragile corner in the middle of the rear panel. There are color-coded stickers with recommendations for routing cables through certain channels, and these stickers are placed over molded outlines. The case has optional screws everywhere, magnets to help click panels into place, and guides that are sturdy and well-built. The rear slots were thought-through with an optional filter on the bottom and none in the top, since blocking exhaust is pointless. The vertical GPU, despite its weaker performance, is positioned to maximize viability for hot cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h16m46s791.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4972\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h16m46s791.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h16m46s791.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4972\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ad2bb843-695d-4fb8-9a55-16a74b9e33c5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m10s959.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4973\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m10s959.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m10s959.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4973\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e1990d73-f84b-4df5-a113-8057811cb1c0\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>It's easier to point out areas where this attention to detail is lacking, since we only really found two: first, there's no vibration damping for HDDs despite all the rubber washers elsewhere in the case, and second, the bottom filter is flimsy and doesn't eject smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m38s459.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4974\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d7e581ca-a9a6-44d9-a923-cbc9c23f9e63\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The other main downside was just doing reconfigurations with the vertical GPU mount, which can make accessing cables along the motherboard challenging. Most people won’t do that more than once, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case testing is complicated: It’s possible that a configuration with a different GPU, such as a 4090 Founders card, would behave differently. But based on our data, simpler might be better -- and the case would be $70 cheaper. Patrick and Steve both feel the same way, which is that we’d buy the $200 version of this case. It is much more competitive with direct peers at $200. At $270, it’s really only something you’d do for looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the $200 case is worse than the <a href=\"https://howl.link/fvx2tkeinbzm7\">Flux Pro</a> thermally, the build quality and ease-of-installation features are far superior and the case is more future-looking with its concepts. The Flux Pro does well on tradition, and that’s just fine too. We like both cases. If you want something less traditional, HAVN manages to at least hit the basics while advancing the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don't want to beat a dead horse here, but this feels like the case that TRYX wanted to make with the LUCA L70 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/case-disaster-tryx-luca-l70-review\">our review</a>). This is a weird new design from an unknown company with some big money behind it, it's roughly the same size case as the L70, and the LUCA's price falls right between the two SKUs of the HS 420. The HS 420 is more solidly built, it's more practical, it has better cooling (once fans are added), and in our opinion, it looks better too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patrick said this about his concluding thoughts: “I would personally buy this case retail if I didn't need to fit a ton of drives; I haven't felt that way about a case we've covered in several years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike and Patrick both are hopeful that HAVN branches into smaller and cheaper cases. Patrick said, “I hope they don't just make a CLC. It feels inevitable that a company like this is going to make a CLC.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VGPU version is not really our thing. We think the cheaper one looks better and works better and is more widely compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrapping things up, this is a great first showing from HAVN. The case represents a fantastic starting point for a platform to try and do some cool things thermally.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

HAVN's case focuses on trying to innovate on cooling performance. In the vertical GPU orientation, the bottom-mounted fans install at an angle and direct the air towards the glass and use an included glass flow guide to direct the air away from the GPU. That might seem counter-intuitive, but this will be easier to explain using our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v7aRWcM0AFE?t=625\">3D animation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAVN -- that’s the name of the brand for this case -- is separating the hot exhaust air out the bottom of the GPU from the cooler intake, pushing intake at the glass side panel of the case and almost sort of “bouncing” it into the front of the video card. There are trade-offs, but it’s a novel approach for a case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on October 17, 2024 as a video.

The headlining feature is the panoramic glass panel, which is bent at a 90-degree angle with a tight radius. There’s a jutting-out cable management area that sticks out under the motherboard, a design consistency with rounded edges even under the case, and rubber string-like cable management suspension in the grommets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The panel rolls into the case with four plastic wheels, then slots into place with support along the whole bottom edge. It takes some getting used to, but HAVN includes stickers detailing removal. The manufacturing precision required to get this working, and working well, is beyond what we're used to seeing and is executed expertly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the exterior panels are firmly magnetically attached and all include optional screw holes for extra security while shipping. You hear in most of our reviews that we favor at least optional screws for panel security to prevent issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m11s440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4899\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m11s440.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m11s440.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4899\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"107ddaa2-54f8-4d5b-a3eb-de72fe4dc773\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m13s617.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4900\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m13s617.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m13s617.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4900\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5ef65660-9067-4fbb-868e-03c7511c5832\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m17s224.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4901\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m17s224.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-13h59m17s224.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4901\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9fbcb430-d815-48cb-a92b-af7f8a69fe40\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The visual theming is consistent throughout the whole case.

It works better than most GPU supports and we liked it. Our only complaint is that the support can only work as shown in the manual for GPUs up to ~300mm long: any longer and the bracket can't reach all the way to the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the VGPU model, it comes with a preinstalled four-slot vertical GPU bracket and what HAVN claims is a PCIe 5.0 riser cable. Currently, there are no PCIe 5.0 consumer GPUs; however, it’s possible the 50-series may go in this direction. There is not a great non-enterprise way to validate the 5.0 claim from HAVN and performance impact is yet unknown, but likely minimal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VGPU kit isn’t sold separately at launch. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-14h01m18s659.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4908\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"375191b5-2b51-42f5-aa9d-1725791e06bc\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The VGPU model’s bottom fan bracket is replaced with an angled bracket for 3x 140mm fans and a curved glass pane intended to direct the air. The GPU bracket can be adjusted back and forth, which is necessary in order to get the corner of the GPU flush with the curved airflow shield as shown in the manual. Our <a href=\"https://howl.link/g86lp8lqen1jy\">4070 Ti Super</a> isn’t fat enough to get as close to the shield as HAVN suggests. Using it precisely as intended requires a GPU with a cooler that's four slots thick.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-14h01m39s321.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4909\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"96870a72-2be5-4771-a023-4516c68c5014\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Even without the VGPU hardware, HAVN recommends an unusual airflow pattern for the HS 420. Top exhaust, side intake, and bottom intake are all typical, but all of HAVN's recommended configurations show the lower rear slot as filtered intake and the upper rear slot as exhaust.

The glass attaches to the back of the angled fan tray. This flow guide will push cool air at the glass side panel, at which point it’ll either physically deflect or will be overpowered and pulled-in by the GPU’s own fans. Likewise, hot air exiting the GPU bottom out of vertically oriented fins will now get shoved behind the glass and behind the fan tray. The back of the fan tray is fully enclosed by steel and glass, so there won’t be any hot air ingress. The glass shroud walls the hot air off. Instead, it ends up in a small chamber between the cable management shroud and the fan tray. This air will need to find a way out, and the most likely pathway is the bottom-rear fan. We’ll come back to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This results in the intake air now making multiple turns, which will affect both air velocity and air pressure: Velocity will decrease at the point it enters the GPU fans as a result of the turns and indirect path. Because the fans themselves are angled, the air ends up making close to a 90-degree turn -- shallower than if they were flat in the bottom with a flow guide, but still a big change in direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h39m03s490.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4925\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8bb3ec6b-fb7e-41c9-96f2-0ddff17043d9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The glass shroud itself has two points where it bends and a straight section: The first is a 40-degree angle, then about a 50-degree angle.

Because it endeavors to compete with the best cases on our charts, we needed to see if it could actually beat the best. We decided to standardize against a set of fans from one of the best cases on the charts: The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-Included-High-Airflow-Radiator-Full-Tower/dp/B0DDNJZK13?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Antec Flux Pro</a>, which comes with 6 fans and has held the #1 rank in some tests recently. We pulled all 6 of its fans (4x 140, which is perfect for the bottom intake configuration and 2x 120 reverse blade), which allows us to make a direct head-to-head comparison. We’ve noted for a long time the limitations of our standardized fan test methods in cases, so for this review, we decided to experiment. We might start instead standardizing against a case that competes in a similar class, which would give fewer individual case reference points, but allow us to test against head-to-head competition in a controlled way with the same fans in a more optimized setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Test Configurations</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So this marks sort of a new trial in our case reviews. It also enabled us to do more configurations for this case. Let us know if you like it and we’ll apply it to some future cases as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-14h06m01s058.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4948\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"553ab13f-769e-4ce3-95d1-5fc46a931a08\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here are the 8 configurations we ran. We only had a few days working on this case with Arrow Lake coming up, so we might do more later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tests labeled “A” are with some form of bottom intake. A1 has the angled tray and glass, A2 ditches the glass, and A3 goes flat-mount ditching both. The rest of their setup is the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tests labeled “B” are with side intake. Remember, the budget is 6 fans to match the leading Flux Pro, so we stopped there for now. For this, we experimented with variations on the single 140mm fan in the top, moving it either in front of the cooler as intake or behind it as exhaust. We also experimented with the rear-bottom fan, swapping to either intake straight into the GPU or exhaust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Only: Optimal Fan Placement by CPU & GPU Rank</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-14h06m07s768.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4949\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"63990f93-40b8-4178-b715-033688f12de1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This quick table shows the rank of each configuration in GPU thermals and CPU thermals. We’ll look at actual results in a moment, but this is a summary of the 6-fan budget. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best combined performer here was configuration B1, which had a vertical GPU without bottom fans, 3x side intake fans, 1x mid-front intake up top, and 2x rear exhaust fans. The best performer for GPU thermals was B3, which has a horizontal GPU, side intake, no bottom fans, and intake in the rear-bottom of the case, but it was at the cost of CPU thermals ranking 7th of 8 configurations. The best CPU performer was B2, which has a horizontal GPU, side intake fans, rear exhaust, and the top fan arranged as CPU tower intake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s move to individual data for inspection with just the HAVN case first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Only: GPU Thermals at 100%</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20HAVN%20Configs%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4950\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"719236fe-3365-410d-963f-b236e9fbe3fc\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s the chart for GPU thermals at full speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The total spread is 4.6 degrees, which is actually pretty wide for GPU thermal differences in our testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with the glass flow guide: Our direct comparison of A1 vs. A2 has identical setup aside from the guide. On the chart, A1 with the angled fans and glass shroud performed the worst, with A2 performing 1.8 degrees better for GPU average temperature. That’s a real difference and outside of expected variance. A2 is identical but removes the glass shroud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best performer for the GPU was a horizontal GPU and side intake with B3. This isn’t too surprising. Horizontal GPUs often breathe better, but if you truly wanted a vertical GPU for display, our best-performing vertical setup was B1, which uses side intake, a top intake fan in front of the CPU cooler, and two rear exhaust fans. A3 is next, this time with 3x bottom intake fans but mounted flat rather than in the angled tray. This is a direct comparison to A1 and A2 without any changes. In our testing, it appears that the special bracket for the bottom fans and all the complicated curves and turns and glass are hindering performance. This makes sense. Air shooting straight in and without reroutes is just performing better with A3. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Only: CPU Thermals at 100%</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20HAVN%20Configs%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4951\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"73b64f2e-57b4-4ab4-9707-4cf8c34230f5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Looking at CPU thermals in detail: Configurations B2, B1, and A3 are functionally identical. A3 with the flush-mounted bottom intake fans did better for the CPU than those where the fans were angled at the glass. Config A2 was about 2 degrees worse than B2, so the total spread here is largely inconsequential. It’d make more sense to choose based on GPU performance than CPU tower performance between these configurations. Side intake is favored.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>HAVN Only: VRM & RAM Thermals at 100%</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28VRM_RAM%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20HAVN%20Configs%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4952\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a32ad22a-4ee0-41e5-be1e-406f627d7a6b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>For VRM and memory thermals, there’s another relatively wide spread of about 6 degrees on system memory. B1 runs at 13 degrees over ambient for DDR5, which is impressive. B3 runs at 19 degrees over ambient -- totally fine, but 6 degrees warmer shows an inefficiency. The cooler result benefits from an intake fan immediately above the RAM and VRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to get into the competitive benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Thermals: Full Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20Stock%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4953\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f693bce2-9990-467d-94a3-3e49c5031e5f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This chart is for GPU thermals with the fans at full speed. We’ve removed all configs for the HAVN case except the best and worst. You can find the full HAVN data in the prior charts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, remember that the HAVN case does not include fans. Because of this, its performance is basically whatever we want it to be, based on fans we choose. We normalized to the Antec Flux Pro, so that’s our direct comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Flux Pro wins. Antec’s thermals are superior for the GPU while maintaining roughly equivalent noise levels, functionally noise-normalizing HAVN for the Flux Pro. The HAVN case still does well and ranks right alongside the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-Tempered-High-Airflow-Computer/dp/B09XQS5GJN?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Torrent</a>, which has remained an impressive show of force for Fractal. It’s just that HAVN isn’t dominating the charts as much as we’d have liked for a case so thoughtfully focused on new approaches to fan placement. It’s a good start, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A1 has the bottom intake bracket and VGPU and landed lower down the chart. We’d favor the horizontal GPU solution.

Noise levels are about the same. This has the HAVN HS420 led by the Flux Pro with standard PSU orientation, the 216, and 207. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-North-Charcoal-Black/dp/B0CJCJ3ZZB?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">North XL</a> is also about tied with the HS420, but is much louder at 45 dBA, where these HS420 configs land closer to 39-40dBA. The Antec comparison is the most relevant since the fans are identical.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"havn-hs420-conclusion\"><strong>HAVN HS420 Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

It’s sad to see it not do better with all the special tuning, but looking back at our emails, even the HAVN team itself thought that the horizontal GPU configuration would do better in our testing. They were right. The vertical GPU setup, as fancy as it is, is still about balancing looks. Vertical GPUs are often disadvantaged, and HAVN hasn’t defeated that here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thermals are our focus. From a pure thermal performance standpoint, HAVN has not become the new best on the charts. The ideas are there, and for a first case, they got close -- but it is beaten by cheaper cases on this front.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-14h07m57s619.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4955\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"6632a14c-00ea-470b-a15f-dcc35c2f67d1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Cases aren’t all about thermals, though. Despite that being our top priority, all 3 of us (Patrick, Mike, and Steve) who were hands-on with the case would consider buying one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all spent a lot of time personally working on this case. Each of us has gone through full assembly at least once on the system. All 3 of us were in total agreement that the quality is overall phenomenal and that we can’t overstate the attention to detail put into the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HAVN-Dual-Chamber-Vertical-SimpliCable-Management/dp/B0DDCNTBFS?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">HS420</a>.

align with the hubs and edges of top-mounted fans, minimizing overlap with the fan blades. The right side panel does the same, intentionally aligning the blockages from structural elements with the dead zones on the fans. This is awesome attention to detail that we don’t commonly see. There are protective rubber dampers on everything: on the screws and the tabs that attach the fan trays to the case, on the 120mm adapters for the rear fans, on the posts that the bottom fan mounts rest on, on the airflow shield, and under a fragile corner in the middle of the rear panel. There are color-coded stickers with recommendations for routing cables through certain channels, and these stickers are placed over molded outlines. The case has optional screws everywhere, magnets to help click panels into place, and guides that are sturdy and well-built. The rear slots were thought-through with an optional filter on the bottom and none in the top, since blocking exhaust is pointless. The vertical GPU, despite its weaker performance, is positioned to maximize viability for hot cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h16m46s791.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4972\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h16m46s791.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h16m46s791.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4972\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ad2bb843-695d-4fb8-9a55-16a74b9e33c5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m10s959.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4973\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m10s959.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m10s959.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4973\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e1990d73-f84b-4df5-a113-8057811cb1c0\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>It's easier to point out areas where this attention to detail is lacking, since we only really found two: first, there's no vibration damping for HDDs despite all the rubber washers elsewhere in the case, and second, the bottom filter is flimsy and doesn't eject smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-12-15h17m38s459.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4974\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d7e581ca-a9a6-44d9-a923-cbc9c23f9e63\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The other main downside was just doing reconfigurations with the vertical GPU mount, which can make accessing cables along the motherboard challenging. Most people won’t do that more than once, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case testing is complicated: It’s possible that a configuration with a different GPU, such as a 4090 Founders card, would behave differently. But based on our data, simpler might be better -- and the case would be $70 cheaper. Patrick and Steve both feel the same way, which is that we’d buy the $200 version of this case. It is much more competitive with direct peers at $200. At $270, it’s really only something you’d do for looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the $200 case is worse than the <a href=\"https://howl.link/fvx2tkeinbzm7\">Flux Pro</a> thermally, the build quality and ease-of-installation features are far superior and the case is more future-looking with its concepts. The Flux Pro does well on tradition, and that’s just fine too. We like both cases. If you want something less traditional, HAVN manages to at least hit the basics while advancing the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don't want to beat a dead horse here, but this feels like the case that TRYX wanted to make with the LUCA L70 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cases/case-disaster-tryx-luca-l70-review\">our review</a>). This is a weird new design from an unknown company with some big money behind it, it's roughly the same size case as the L70, and the LUCA's price falls right between the two SKUs of the HS 420. The HS 420 is more solidly built, it's more practical, it has better cooling (once fans are added), and in our opinion, it looks better too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patrick said this about his concluding thoughts: “I would personally buy this case retail if I didn't need to fit a ton of drives; I haven't felt that way about a case we've covered in several years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike and Patrick both are hopeful that HAVN branches into smaller and cheaper cases. Patrick said, “I hope they don't just make a CLC. It feels inevitable that a company like this is going to make a CLC.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The VGPU version is not really our thing. We think the cheaper one looks better and works better and is more widely compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrapping things up, this is a great first showing from HAVN. The case represents a fantastic starting point for a platform to try and do some cool things thermally.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The <a href=\"https://howl.link/7e05nta2ycdul\">9900X</a> is $430. AMD has this territory encircled with similarly priced options. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> comes in 19% more expensive at $480 and would also be less viable in most production use cases we test, but far more viable in gaming scenarios. If you’re only doing one of those, that allows you to either ignore or focus on the 7800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31PwSpClk8\">our review</a>). If you’re doing both, that’d be where the 265K might make sense -- if it’s not beaten by Intel’s own <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> at $350 and <a href=\"https://howl.link/qpx5gztvyxgvf\">13700K</a> at $290. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And AMD has announced that its <a href=\"https://howl.link/4octeb09tsjcx\">9800X3D</a> will be arriving on November 7th. We’re not sure what it’ll cost yet, so it’s possible it’s not a direct comparison here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, other considerations for Arrow Lake are that it requires an entirely new platform and Z890 boards are some of the most expensive we’ve seen in a given class. It also benefits from faster, more expensive RAM in ways that other CPUs can cut costs and corners. As a positive though, the reduced power consumption means reduced cooler requirements as compared to the prior Intel generations, so that can reduce some cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it for the basics and positioning.

We’re just going with the ATX12V and EPS12V rails for now, as we still think these are the closest to accurate on our setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K ended up at 163W in this test, which has the efficiency at 968 MIPS/W. That has the CPU as less efficient than the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-285K/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">285K</a>, which pulled 162W on the same ATX12V and EPS12V rails, but produced a higher throughput, yielding a 1051 MIPS/W result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7700-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQHSCVF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7700</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0D6NMDNNX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9700X</a>, and everything else, including the 3700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-r7-3700x-r5-3600-2024-revisit-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-5700x3d-more\">our revisit</a>) from 2019, ranks above the 265K as a result.

The power drawn is the same since this test suite runs both consecutively and at about the same power level. The end result is that the 265K is marginally less efficient than the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-245K/dp/B0DFK2P311?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">245K</a>, more meaningfully behind the 285K, and is otherwise mostly just ahead of the prior Intel CPUs. Generationally, the improvement on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a> is actually good. It’s 47%. It’s a real uplift, and Intel does deserve credit for that; however, again, the entire top half of the chart is AMD-dominated. It’s just not even close. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X</a> in Eco Mode leads the 265K in efficiency with an advantage of 87%. The 9700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">our review</a>) is cheaper and also holds a substantial lead, up at 1624 MIPS/W. The 9700X won’t produce as high of a result in this test as the 265K for raw performance, but in efficiency, it is more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9950X-32-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NNRBGP?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9950X</a>, which is AMD’s highest power draw non-HEDT part we’re testing right now, is more efficient than the 265K. This is partly because its performance is so much higher in this test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4857\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"80811464-882a-458c-849a-fb28b5ee4ca1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s gaming with Baldur’s Gate 3. Here, the 265K pulled 89W when measuring both the ATX12V and EPS12V rails. That has it similar to the 285K. We noticed during this testing an initially higher reading on the 265K by almost 10W exactly, but after troubleshooting Vcore and CPU Package Power, we were able to isolate that 10W as being from a measurement tool difference on the 265K platform. We were able to make adjustments to effectively calibrate it for the data we had from all other tests on this chart. As we’ve stated, this is all brand new methodology and is more complicated because of ASUS’ decisions to split the rails for the CPU, but we’re staying on top of hunting down these deviations and accounting for them. This also means we’re going to continue studying the measurements and tools to refine the readings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the 89W measurement, the 265K ends up just below the 285K for efficiency (tied when rounded). Its performance is lower, but power is similar, so the two are effectively equal. The TDP is the same on these CPUs, so if they’re drawing up to the power limit, then this is expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither of these is particularly impressive when considering the 7800X3D or <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a>, both of which have higher framerate and lower power consumption, resulting in higher efficiency. The 245K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-core-ultra-5-245k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5700x3d-13700k-more\">our review</a>) is more efficient than the 285K and 265K, up at 1.3 FPS/W and tied with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rjwzgawup8ztw\">7700</a> and 9700X.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: FFXIV Dawntrail</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4858\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"266cad2e-6d26-4635-9707-e0528739f4db\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Final Fantasy 14, the 265K calibrated to prior tests pulled 65.5W during our testing. We didn’t add a line item for ATX5V in this one since we’ve been saying that we don’t think its impact on the CPU is significant in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lands the 265K at around the same power consumption as the 285K for the same two rails. The efficiency is lower because the framerate is lower. The 245K is more efficient, up at 4.3 FPS/W. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K is the least efficient of these three parts so far on this chart. It’s still improved on the 14700K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-desperate-i7-14700k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>), but because the performance is regressive in this particular title -- and by a lot -- the efficiency struggles to take off despite the reduction in power consumption from what was 98.2W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D has an efficiency lead at 8.3 FPS/W, or a 131% improvement. This is actual insanity. The large framerate boost combined with the steep power reduction gives AMD a big lead here. Again, whether you’re talking outright efficiency or environmental stewardship and absolute power consumption, the answer to both of these would be AMD as the most efficient.

In this one, the 265K ran at 99 FPS AVG, which has it 4.6% ahead of the 245K and means the 285K is about 4-5 FPS ahead of the 265K. The 14700K leads the 265K by 8.6%, with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF57FL5?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">13700K</a> about the same.

That’s not unheard of: The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-285K/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">285K</a> is a higher performer, which benefits the efficiency, and the power budget is the same. Still, it’s improved over the <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a>. Intel has retained that much, but as we said before, in all comparisons we run, AMD is more efficient still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that wraps-up that side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-08-12h16m38s054.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4873\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9768b646-1fc3-48b2-b194-b7035b3620d3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>It’s clear once again that the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-265K/dp/B0DFK2MH2D?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">265K</a> is surrounded by good options on all sides. The 285K is exceptionally bad value for gaming users, with worse performance than you’d get on a $230 <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a> or $480 <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> and also a far higher cost. In non-gaming uses, there are some limited scenarios where you could make an argument for the 285K, but they are relatively rare among our test suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.link/n1h000hp9r3x4\">245K</a> made even less sense: Production use cases effectively vanish as an argument, as the part is majority targeted at gaming users. In gaming, it gets absolutely crushed by not only AMD’s $100 cheaper <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a> (which itself would give you $100 more budget to either keep or throw at a GPU), but also by Intel’s own predecessors that are now cheaper or the same price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K suffers from a bit of both: The cost goes up by $70-$90, and yet the performance doesn’t scale anywhere close to linearly in gaming. The production performance is better, and in that situation almost solely, the 265K can make some stronger arguments for itself. It can outmatch its closest price competitors from AMD at times, so that’s at least good for the 265K. It’s just not a sweeping victory and Intel’s total platform cost is also questionable, especially with the potentially short lifespan of this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’ll wrap our reviews of these for now. We’ll have more Arrow Lake content, but as far as the core part reviews, they’re done until Intel launches more. We wanted to keep this one concise.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

The <a href=\"https://howl.link/7e05nta2ycdul\">9900X</a> is $430. AMD has this territory encircled with similarly priced options. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> comes in 19% more expensive at $480 and would also be less viable in most production use cases we test, but far more viable in gaming scenarios. If you’re only doing one of those, that allows you to either ignore or focus on the 7800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31PwSpClk8\">our review</a>). If you’re doing both, that’d be where the 265K might make sense -- if it’s not beaten by Intel’s own <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> at $350 and <a href=\"https://howl.link/qpx5gztvyxgvf\">13700K</a> at $290. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And AMD has announced that its <a href=\"https://howl.link/4octeb09tsjcx\">9800X3D</a> will be arriving on November 7th. We’re not sure what it’ll cost yet, so it’s possible it’s not a direct comparison here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, other considerations for Arrow Lake are that it requires an entirely new platform and Z890 boards are some of the most expensive we’ve seen in a given class. It also benefits from faster, more expensive RAM in ways that other CPUs can cut costs and corners. As a positive though, the reduced power consumption means reduced cooler requirements as compared to the prior Intel generations, so that can reduce some cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it for the basics and positioning.

Generationally, the improvement on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a> is actually good. It’s 47%. It’s a real uplift, and Intel does deserve credit for that; however, again, the entire top half of the chart is AMD-dominated. It’s just not even close. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X</a> in Eco Mode leads the 265K in efficiency with an advantage of 87%. The 9700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">our review</a>) is cheaper and also holds a substantial lead, up at 1624 MIPS/W. The 9700X won’t produce as high of a result in this test as the 265K for raw performance, but in efficiency, it is more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9950X-32-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NNRBGP?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9950X</a>, which is AMD’s highest power draw non-HEDT part we’re testing right now, is more efficient than the 265K. This is partly because its performance is so much higher in this test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4857\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"80811464-882a-458c-849a-fb28b5ee4ca1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s gaming with Baldur’s Gate 3. Here, the 265K pulled 89W when measuring both the ATX12V and EPS12V rails. That has it similar to the 285K. We noticed during this testing an initially higher reading on the 265K by almost 10W exactly, but after troubleshooting Vcore and CPU Package Power, we were able to isolate that 10W as being from a measurement tool difference on the 265K platform. We were able to make adjustments to effectively calibrate it for the data we had from all other tests on this chart. As we’ve stated, this is all brand new methodology and is more complicated because of ASUS’ decisions to split the rails for the CPU, but we’re staying on top of hunting down these deviations and accounting for them. This also means we’re going to continue studying the measurements and tools to refine the readings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the 89W measurement, the 265K ends up just below the 285K for efficiency (tied when rounded). Its performance is lower, but power is similar, so the two are effectively equal. The TDP is the same on these CPUs, so if they’re drawing up to the power limit, then this is expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither of these is particularly impressive when considering the 7800X3D or <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a>, both of which have higher framerate and lower power consumption, resulting in higher efficiency. The 245K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-core-ultra-5-245k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5700x3d-13700k-more\">our review</a>) is more efficient than the 285K and 265K, up at 1.3 FPS/W and tied with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rjwzgawup8ztw\">7700</a> and 9700X.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: FFXIV Dawntrail</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4858\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"266cad2e-6d26-4635-9707-e0528739f4db\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Final Fantasy 14, the 265K calibrated to prior tests pulled 65.5W during our testing. We didn’t add a line item for ATX5V in this one since we’ve been saying that we don’t think its impact on the CPU is significant in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lands the 265K at around the same power consumption as the 285K for the same two rails. The efficiency is lower because the framerate is lower. The 245K is more efficient, up at 4.3 FPS/W. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K is the least efficient of these three parts so far on this chart. It’s still improved on the 14700K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-desperate-i7-14700k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>), but because the performance is regressive in this particular title -- and by a lot -- the efficiency struggles to take off despite the reduction in power consumption from what was 98.2W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D has an efficiency lead at 8.3 FPS/W, or a 131% improvement. This is actual insanity. The large framerate boost combined with the steep power reduction gives AMD a big lead here. Again, whether you’re talking outright efficiency or environmental stewardship and absolute power consumption, the answer to both of these would be AMD as the most efficient. Intel cannot fight on these grounds, despite improvements over its own prior architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Stellaris</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20%28Simulations%20Per%20Watt-Hour%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_4.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4859\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c45157dd-6a7a-4e44-a407-72e939f8ad88\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Stellaris is up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, we have the 265K at 1.5 simulations per watt-hour, about the same as the <a href=\"https://howl.link/gqj3dkz9e0jkp\">5800X</a>, especially considering rounding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we look for a performance-normalized comparison, the closest would be Intel’s own 14700K. The uplift over the predecessor is 50%. AMD’s <a href=\"https://howl.link/nbrwjipoctmpk\">9600X</a> is somewhat close in performance as well, yet holds an advantage at 1.7 simulations per watt-hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Starfield</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Starfield%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4860\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"027c6ed4-f2d0-4930-9d7e-0d0359950a35\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We didn’t capture power data for the 245K in Starfield, but we have the 265K and 285K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K here pulled 144W, putting it around the same as the 285K. Because the performance declines and the power is the same, the efficiency is worse than the 285K once again. The 285K appears to be a better bin in combination with higher efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K ends up about the same as the 14600K. Fortunately, it improves on the 14700K’s 0.6 FPS/W result. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i9-14900K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJDKLB8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14900K</a> has a lower power consumption than the 14700K as a result of an external bottleneck limiting CPU utilization and also the binning. It can’t be fully leveraged. The 285K and 265K are both fully engaged though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"265k-gaming-benchmarks\"><strong>Intel 265K Gaming Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

In this one, the 265K ran at 99 FPS AVG, which has it 4.6% ahead of the 245K and means the 285K is about 4-5 FPS ahead of the 265K. The 14700K leads the 265K by 8.6%, with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF57FL5?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">13700K</a> about the same.

Its low performance here is fine, with no particularly meaningful deviation from the expectation, but overall, the 265K is just not impressive in this test even against its already unimpressive brethren of the same 200 Series.

It wouldn’t be worth buying the $630 285K regardless, and especially not for gaming, but it’s especially not worth it here. Even the 265K makes more sense, and it still doesn’t make a ton of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>) further establishes that storyline with its 355 FPS result, led further by the once-upon-a-time cheaper <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-5600x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-last-chance-upgrade\">5600X3D</a> (when it was briefly available at Micro Center).

The 9600X is less competitive in this gaming test than some of the others, down at 101 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"265k-production-benchmarks\">265K <strong>Production Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to move on to production benchmarks.

That has it near the 14900K. Against the 14700K, the 265K also benefits from a render time reduction of 8%, meaning 8% less time required to complete the work. The reduction in time required against the 13700K is 20%, down from almost 11 minutes. AMD’s <a href=\"https://howl.link/89xvcv2lg93t3\">7950X</a> in ECO mode leads the 265K with an 8% reduction in render time needed, with the non-ECO result at 7.4 minutes and in line behind the 285K. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K beats the 7900X, which at least helps its positioning against similarly priced AMD competition. That isn’t always the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K also benefits from a 31% reduction in render time requirement against the 245K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4870\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"54ee1d68-eea5-4692-8eff-3dd17af11eb2\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>7-Zip Compression is up now. In this test, the 265K ran at 158K MIPS, which puts it roughly tied with AMD’s R9 7900X and behind the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9900X-24-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NN87T8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9900X</a>. The 265K improves on the 245K by 29% in throughput, with the 285K leading the 265K by 8%. This is a test where we saw a large improvement from the memory upgrade in our 285K test with DDR5-8600. We might revisit that topic if we can find some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9900X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-9-9900x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-14700k-7900x-9950x-more\">our review</a>) is about 6% more expensive than the 265K right now and performs about 3.5% better. The 14700K is cheaper than the 265K, but uses more power to score 8% better. The 7950X (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRaJXZMOMPU\">our review</a>) is one of the more interesting CPUs still, but it depends heavily on price. It’s listed at $500 as we write this, or about 24% more than the $405 listing for the 265K on Newegg. The 7950X performs 18% better without Eco Mode on and similarly with it enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4871\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"fbba103e-21eb-4fca-bd4e-fdd588e11ed4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Decompression, the 265K ran at 168K MIPS and landed just behind the two-generation-old 13700K. The refreshed version of that, the 14700K, is up at 195K MIPS, landing the 14700K ahead of both the 285K and the 265K. The 285K only topples it when upgraded with faster memory, but of course, giving the same treatment to the 14700K would also leapfrog it ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14700K leads the 265K by 15.7%. The 265K leads AMD’s <a href=\"https://howl.link/n2vxkxqu2730b\">7700X</a> by 19%. X3D doesn’t really help here, so the 7800X3D and 5700X3D fall down the stack comparatively, despite strong gaming performance and really good efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD’s production-oriented 7900X leads the 265K by a staggering 24%, with the 9900X leading by 27%. The 7900X is currently the same price as the 265K, making it a better value in this comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Adobe Premiere</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Adobe%20Premiere%20%28Puget%20Suite%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4872\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7b500c71-7f4c-4187-b8f3-d0b68395e048\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Adobe Premiere is up next, tested with the Puget suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, the 265K scored 10718 points in aggregate. Puget Systems takes the intraframe score, RAW score, GPU effective, and other filter and editing testing into consideration for this score.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The score has it roughly tied with the eco mode 7950X and 9900X. Its advantage over the 7900X is at least a little more, at 8%. The 7900 (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtVowYykviM\">our review</a>) scored similarly. The 265K also leads the 13700K by 1%, so basically error. The 14700K leads the 265K by 2.4%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K did well in this particular test and managed to outrank the 14900K, leading the 265K by 5.8%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"265k-conclusion\"><strong>Intel 265K Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

That’s not unheard of: The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-285K/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">285K</a> is a higher performer, which benefits the efficiency, and the power budget is the same. Still, it’s improved over the <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a>. Intel has retained that much, but as we said before, in all comparisons we run, AMD is more efficient still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that wraps-up that side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-08-12h16m38s054.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4873\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9768b646-1fc3-48b2-b194-b7035b3620d3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>It’s clear once again that the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-265K/dp/B0DFK2MH2D?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">265K</a> is surrounded by good options on all sides. The 285K is exceptionally bad value for gaming users, with worse performance than you’d get on a $230 <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a> or $480 <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> and also a far higher cost. In non-gaming uses, there are some limited scenarios where you could make an argument for the 285K, but they are relatively rare among our test suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.link/n1h000hp9r3x4\">245K</a> made even less sense: Production use cases effectively vanish as an argument, as the part is majority targeted at gaming users. In gaming, it gets absolutely crushed by not only AMD’s $100 cheaper <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a> (which itself would give you $100 more budget to either keep or throw at a GPU), but also by Intel’s own predecessors that are now cheaper or the same price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 265K suffers from a bit of both: The cost goes up by $70-$90, and yet the performance doesn’t scale anywhere close to linearly in gaming. The production performance is better, and in that situation almost solely, the 265K can make some stronger arguments for itself. It can outmatch its closest price competitors from AMD at times, so that’s at least good for the 265K. It’s just not a sweeping victory and Intel’s total platform cost is also questionable, especially with the potentially short lifespan of this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’ll wrap our reviews of these for now. We’ll have more Arrow Lake content, but as far as the core part reviews, they’re done until Intel launches more. We wanted to keep this one concise.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The 9800X3D is a Zen 5 CPU with extra cache, but with critical changes to the location of the cache within the die stack. <br />As we talked about in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amQOwllDXWE\">separate technical video</a>, the 9800X3D has shifted the extra cache under the core complex, leading to more direct contact from the CPU cores to the IHS lid underside. AMD has also eliminated some of its bonding layers within the CPU, which reduces insulation further, and it has removed the structural silicon that leveled the top of the cache die to better mate the IHS in prior X3D designs. That’s because the extra cache die and the core complex die are now the same physical dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on November 6, 2024 as a video.

The <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> is about $476 now and is out of stock with a listed former price of $450 on Newegg. The 7800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31PwSpClk8\">our review</a>) has previously been as low as $300 to $330, with drops in August to around $360. Lately, its price has stabilized higher. We have a policy of making comparisons against pricing at the time of the review, so we’ll use the $476-$480 figure today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a> is priced at $187 to $230. The 7950X (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRaJXZMOMPU\">our review</a>) is a similar price to the 9800X3D, landing at about $500. That’d be one to pay attention to for non-gaming workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s competition includes the <a href=\"https://howl.link/tqzjvl93yihv6\">285K</a>, to the extent you can even call it “competition,” seeing as it barely competes with Intel’s own parts on value. The 285K(read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">our review</a>) is $630 where it can be found, and you shouldn’t buy it, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/r2e89d3f7fdac\">265K</a>(watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cqSz4k_HDs\">our review</a>) at $400. The prior generation parts, like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/x8t9qmerfhqkt\">14900K</a>, have fallen in price lately. That’s at $440, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> at $347.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a lot to get through, so let’s get into the benchmarks. We’ll have frequency, gaming, efficiency, and production tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"frequency-comparison\">AMD 9800X3D Frequency Comparison</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>AMD 9800X3D All-Core Frequency Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frequency%20Comparison%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20in%20Blender%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4821\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ccdc0097-fe01-43ac-ac64-59d8f0f3c6b4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We’ll start with a comparison of frequency against the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a>. This will help explain the performance differences we’re going to see today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an all-core workload with Blender, we observed the 9800X3D maintaining an average all-core frequency at a fixed 5225 MHz without any dropping. The stability and flatness of this frequency is a result of the higher power limit, which is allowing the core all the power it needs to maintain this boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D averaged between 4800 and 4890 MHz during the original review cycle for this same test. It’s significantly lower and less fixed, shown by the line’s variability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>AMD 9800X3D Single-Core Frequency Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frequency%20Comparison%20%28Max%201T%20in%20CB%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4822\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"34a60eca-3c77-48d9-bb85-c21ae128891b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In a single-thread comparison with Cinebench, the 9800X3D also held a maximum single-core boost of 5225 MHz throughout the duration of the test. The 7800X3D held at 5050 MHz in the same test as a maximum single-core frequency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between these two tests, the 9800X3D holds a significant frequency advantage over its predecessor in both all-core and single-core loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>VID Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20VID%20Comparison%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20VID%20in%20Blender%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4823\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"06dfb726-fe50-48c3-936c-eddffc5cb9ef\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We also ran a voltage ID comparison just with software. In Blender, the 9800X3D held a VID of 1.18V on average, with the 7800X3D at about 1.07V. The 7800X3D is power limited and also running at lower clocks, which combine to yield a lower VID.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"thermal-benchmark\"><strong>AMD 9800X3D Thermal Benchmark</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Thermal%20Benchmark%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20in%20Blender%29%20_%209800X3D%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4824\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b4c3ce73-d345-41e4-a21d-9af9d7749bb8\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Using the same Blender all-core workload, we measured a Tdie CPU temperature of approximately 77 degrees Celsius in a 21-degree Celsius environment when using a 360mm Liquid Freezer II at 100% pump and fan speeds. CPU die average was similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The L3 cache plotted just over 50 degrees Celsius, with the CPU IOD temperatures around 41 degrees with hotspot readings at about 50 degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D cannot be directly compared to the 7800X3D thermally by using internal sensors picked up by software. It would be erroneous without accounting for the changes AMD has made in its sensors. The AMD temperature sensors have been relocated within the silicon and moved to cooler locations to prevent clock dropping too early. We talked about this in our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">9700X review</a> and provided a controlled comparison so you can better understand why the sensor readout isn't directly comparable between the architectures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>9700X vs. 9800X3D Thermals</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Thermal%20Benchmark%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20in%20Blender%29%20_%209800X3D%20%26%209700X%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4825\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b1222e3e-ee64-4e47-b0a5-2f6449be5552\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>It can be directly compared to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rvrnysl2yqoos\">9700X</a>, though.

The 9700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">our review</a>) ran a Tdie of about 52 degrees Celsius under the same test conditions and with the same cooler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With PBO maxed-out on the 9700X, we saw about a 13W higher power draw than the 9800X3D stock. This landed the 9700X at about 86 degrees Celsius. It isn’t perfectly comparable because the power isn’t exactly matched and we ultimately don’t have an easy way to directly compare the 7800X3D’s thermals from the cache change without solutions that require more time than AMD gives in a review cycle. Even still, the key takeaway is that the 9800X3D is not burning the cores at excessive temperatures even with the stacked solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"9800x3d-gaming-benchmarks\"><strong>AMD 9800X3D Gaming Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

Lower is better, with the result measured in seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zen 5 has already shown advantages in this test, with the 9700X previously scoring the new top rank in the benchmark and outmatching all prior CPUs. Core count has limited benefit in this beyond 8 cores for AMD, but IPC and clocks seem to matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D absolutely crushes the prior top result, with a 25.8-second result against the 9700X’s already barrier-breaking 30.3-second result. This previously appeared to be a limitation of the memory, which we can see reinforced by the 31.1-second 285K result at DDR5-8600 vs. the stock result at 32.5. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original X3D CPU with the 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>) posted a 35.4-second result against the 40.7 result of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5800X-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0815XFSGK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5800X</a>, so we’re seeing a repeat of that era, which was also impressive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D also reduces the 7800X3D’s simulation time by 17.6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s best showing is the 285K with faster memory, but that’s not a like-for-like comparison as we could boost memory on AMD also. The 285K stock required 32.5 seconds to complete the simulation, meaning the 9800X3D reduces time required by 21%. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7950X3D-Hexadeca-core-Processor/dp/B0BTRH9MNS?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X3D</a> shows why we haven’t retested it, underperforming overall for reasons explained in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gCzXdLmjPY\">review</a> of the part. Even with the new data, it underperforms vs. the 7800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i9-14900K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJDKLB8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14900K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a> are effectively tied and within error of each other, and removing any limits wouldn’t change that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great showing for the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Dragon%27s%20Dogma%202%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4876\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"339ba3bd-6967-4ca4-b6a0-a04e32f7497d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is up now, another of our 2024 titles. This game, even with all its updates to improve CPU performance, is still heavy on CPUs. The 9800X3D distances itself from the 7800X3D with a 16.2% uplift, gaining on the original 111 FPS AVG to an impressive 129 FPS AVG. We reran this one multiple times to ensure the result was right, but it ended up not even being our biggest gain in the suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gain on the 14900K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intels-300w-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>)was about 17%, up from 109.6 FPS AVG. The same is true of the prior 5800X3D. Over the 285K, we saw a 23% uplift. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frametimes were improved in this game, but not as much as we saw in some other games. The improvement is more or less proportional to the average framerate, so there is no particularly impressive divergence in lows. In other words, it tracks with what we’d expect of a 129 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FFXIV Dawntrail - 1080p</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20Benchmark%20v1-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_6.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4877\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b3964655-af7b-426b-b624-cd2b39ca5395\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is up now, released this year. The 9800X3D breaks the previous upper bound of the chart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s run through the flagships: The 9800X3D CPU ran at 373 FPS AVG, which has it at 5.6% higher framerate than the 7800X3D while costing the same as the current 7800X3D pricing at time of writing. The 14900K ran at 310.3 FPS AVG, giving the 9800X3D a massive lead of 20.2%. This is one of the games where the new Arrow Lake CPUs are hugely regressive and impressively bad value, so the 285K’s 270 FPS AVG gives the 9800X3D an overwhelming lead of 38.3% higher average framerate. As for the 5800X3D, the lead is 11.8% over the prior AMD gaming flagship’s 334 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some anchors to older parts: The R7 2700 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-2023-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-7800x3d-cpu-upgrades\">our revisit</a>) and 2600 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-2600x-1600-af-2024-revisit-vs-5800x3d-7800x3d-more-cpu-benchmarks\">our revisit</a>) were around 145 to 150 FPS AVG, with the 2600 benefiting from a frequency advantage. The 3600 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3489-amd-ryzen-5-3600-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-intel\">our review</a>) was at 170 FPS AVG. The Intel <a href=\"https://howl.link/9ve4vm89fhxl5\">12100F</a> is down at 186 FPS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FFXIV Dawntrail Frametimes</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frametime%20Comparison%20%28FFXIV%201080p_Max%29%20_%209800X3D%20vs%207800X3D%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4829\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dae104b0-4094-41ae-b0b5-63743866a922\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>For frametimes, we observed overall similar frame-to-frame intervals for the 9800X3D and 7800X3D. Typically, they oscillate between 2ms and 4ms intervals, where 16.667ms would be 60 FPS. The spikes are what matter: The 9800X3D in this title has slightly shorter excursions from the mean than the 7800X3D. The difference is hardly perceptible, but on a technicality, the 9800X3D does deliver more consistent frametimes in this title.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 from 2023 is up next. We want to caveat this one with a disclaimer: We saw a larger than typical gain in the 9800X3D versus the 7800X3D for this. After we spent a day troubleshooting it, we have come to the conclusion that there is no evidence to suggest any testing errors or uncharacteristic issues caused by the test or game itself, so we’re going to run the data because it’s interesting. We’d pull it if we had any substantiated concerns. We checked with two other reviewers in peer review, ran HWINFO logging, reran the tests multiple times on both the 9800X3D and 7800X3D, and came to the same conclusions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_6.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4878\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2806f410-8591-48b8-8de3-9f1cfa636761\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The game has the 9800X3D way up at 160 FPS AVG, leading the 7800X3D by an obscene 26.9%.

We think this is why the performance is so disproportionately good: There’s a much higher power budget, so we’re not trimming the frequency peaks, and the power consumption itself overall isn’t excessive in this game. The two combine for full boosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plotting the 7800X3D, we see a much spikier, less predictable average all-core frequency that bounces between 4500 MHz and about 5050 MHz under load. The highest single-core frequency is also variable. This is contributing to the behaviors discovered in this test. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Rainbow%20Six%20Siege%20_%201080p_VHigh%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4879\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2cc0afda-fcd9-44bf-ad79-3cb98945a088\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Rainbow Six Siege, the 9800X3D landed at 643 FPS AVG and led the 7800X3D’s 622 FPS result by 3.4%.

It at least gives perspective that you may not see big differences in heavily bound scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K ran at 586 FPS AVG here, so the 9800X3D has a 10% improvement.

The 9700X scored 1389 MIPS/W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D ends up relatively efficient in compression, but less efficient than the prior 7800X3D. The 7800X3D was not a higher performer, but because this is a calculation of both power and performance, either one can help to counterbalance a deficit in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Intel’s 285K measured at 1051 MIPS/W, which is improved upon its prior efficiency performance in the 14900K, which was way down at 672 MIPS/W. That’s with the EPS12V and ATX12V line measured on the 285K. The AMD CPUs do not pull from ATX12V in any meaningful way in our testing. The PCIe slot is isolated, as are fans and RGB LEDs. 5V from I/O is also isolated. This means there is some overhead in ATX12V on Intel from the RAM and other small devices, but nowhere near enough to meaningfully move that needle closer to AMD.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4838\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"97cc4f0a-de52-4383-99a0-a3c511a1218c\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Decompression efficiency is up now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, the 9800X3D ends up at 1482 MIPS/W, just under the 5600X (which is benefitted by its 60W power reading) and above the 7950X at 183W.

It’s atypical because prior X3D parts do not necessarily see such gains, such as the 7800X3D at 15.9 minutes to the better results from both the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7700-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQHSCVF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7700</a> (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGAwgGxJLHI\">our review</a>)and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHHT8LY?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7700X</a>.

The 7800X3D’s 10,162 point result gives the 9800X3D a lead of 17%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD does well in this specific Photoshop test right now. Intel’s first CPUs show up way down the chart, at around the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7600X-12-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBJDS62N?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7600X</a> (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM-twyjfYIw\">our review</a>)and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7900-24-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQK718H?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7900</a> levels of performance with the 14900K and 14700K. The 285K does about the same as the 13700K here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one where the 9800X3D manages to boost itself even in a non-gaming scenario, benefitted by the extra power available for clock boosting as compared to the 9700X.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Value Comparisons (USD/FPS)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20%E2%96%B3%20in%20USD_FPS%20at%20Various%207800X3D%20Prices%20%28Negative%20Favors%209800X3D%29%20_%20EXPERIMENTAL%20CHART%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4849\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"60db63f3-f49d-4aed-8c8a-49d13784c4a9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This chart is an experiment. We don’t want you to place too much usefulness in this particular chart because it is experimental, but we also can’t try new things if we always try to perfect them first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This chart shows the delta in USD per FPS at various simulated prices for the 7800X3D. The 9800X3D is fixed at $480 in all of these simulations, with the 7800X3D variable based on the number you see in the chart legend on the right. A negative value means that the 9800X3D is that amount cheaper per FPS than the 7800X3D, while a positive value means the 9800X3D is that amount more expensive per FPS than the 7800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At near price parity, the 9800X3D has significant value advantages in Dragon’s Dogma 2, Baldur’s Gate 3, Starfield, and even Phantom Liberty. Value is functionally the same in F1, Rainbow Six, and Final Fantasy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t until a $420 price for the 7800X3D that the Starfield value gains are mostly eliminated. At $400 7800X3D versus $480 9800X3D, the 7800X3D starts to make a ton of sense as a better value, assuming that’s how you shop. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency vs. Performance Change</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20_%20Increase%20in%20Power%20vs.%20_%20Increase%20Performance%20%287800X3D%20to%209800X3D%29%20_%20EXPERIMENTAL%20CHART%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4850\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"404a0b26-5508-4c41-a26f-7f30088069fe\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This is also an experimental chart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, we’re showing the percent increase in power consumption for the application in the left axis vs. the percent increase in performance. The best result would be a larger performance increase than the power increase by percent, although linearity is also good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Baldur’s Gate and Stellaris, with the latter converted to simulations per hour so that higher is better, the percent performance increase is either improved or nearly linear with the percent power increase. In Starfield, the performance increase costs a substantial power increase. We saw the same in Phantom Liberty. These are our two most power-hungry games in the suite and fully leverage the power budget. 7-Zip also saw this swing. Dawntrail is bottlenecked, so can’t reliably be used. Even limited though, power is higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD might be past the most efficient point in the curve, but results like Stellaris support that it is still relatively balanced. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"9800x3d-conclusion\"><strong>AMD 9800X3D Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

After this impromptu hydrolysis reaction, there aren’t many compelling reasons to pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap some key points quickly:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-07-12h59m10s575.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4851\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5d431289-d59e-498e-b356-b0cc430ef579\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 9800X3D is definitely the new gaming king, and this time, it’s priced similarly to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a>. The original launch price of the 7800X3D was $450. Even at that price, the 9800X3D is a worthwhile improvement and doesn’t feel like stagnation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some big boosts to performance over the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a>: Stellaris saw the 9800X3D break through a glass ceiling and propel to new heights against the already-dominant 7800X3D; Starfield saw about a 16% improvement; Dragon’s Dogma 2 saw a 16% uplift, also breaking through what seemed like a ceiling; Baldur’s Gate 3 had a 26-27% improvement, which was such a big swing that we re-ran the tests on both CPUs, collected HWINFO logs during execution, and closely inspected the graphics to ensure equal renders. We also checked with another reviewer who saw a 17% uplift in the game while testing in a different area and under different settings, which is close enough when considering those changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without that, the CPU is just overall competitive in gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For efficiency, the 9800X3D doesn’t manage to hold onto AMD’s multi-generation history of its new X3D CPU becoming the most efficient in our charts. The CPU is still good, and we’d still classify it as “efficient” overall when considering everything else on the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Production isn’t as competitive as other parts, so if you’re not building a gaming-first system, you should just buy a different CPU. But it’s good enough for a mix of work and high-end gaming, and likewise, it uncharacteristically improves upon the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rvrnysl2yqoos\">9700X</a>. We haven’t always seen this with X3D, as frequency is typically sacrificed for power as a result of the thermal limiters imposed by the heat sandwich AMD previously had with the stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel isn’t anywhere close on the gaming charts. It isn’t only beaten, its new 285K flagship -- which is, for some completely insane reason, $630 -- is sometimes beaten by 40-60%. Typically, we’re seeing 25-35% when unbound by the GPU. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel does better in the production benchmarks, but we still wouldn’t recommend the Ultra 200 series broadly. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/nuicv57sgirwo\">9950X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X</a> remain competitive, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/x8t9qmerfhqkt\">14900K</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> also somewhat competitive here. There are some very limited use cases, such as the buzzworded “creation” scenarios, where the 285K makes some sense. But Intel is marketing the 285K on efficiency, and AMD is more efficient in every test we’ve run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire last few months have been wild: We watched AMD open it up with Zen 5, where it drunkenly fumbled the football back 5 yards on the field. Intel then picked up the ball and proceeded to run towards its own goal, at which point it tripped over its shoe laces that came unglued. AMD then picked the ball up and walked it the rest of the way with the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And somehow, it worked. AMD was set up for a slam dunk on this launch with both its own and Intel’s fumbles, and by under-marketing the performance, it was in a position where only the price could screw the launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This launch was also the most organized out of the last several months, including AMD’s own Zen 5 launch. An organized launch is important: With about 2 weeks of testing time rather than the few days we’ve had, plus a mature platform without mid-testing reworks, it is clear that AMD really sat down and planned the launch rather than shoving it out the door in a panic to respond to something else. This gives us some additional confidence that there won’t be any unexpected, major problems with issues like BSODs or BIOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it for the 9800X3D review. You have all the numbers to make decisions. The 7800X3D may make more sense in the event its price falls significantly, but overall and all things totaled, we’re positive on this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

The 9800X3D is a Zen 5 CPU with extra cache, but with critical changes to the location of the cache within the die stack. <br />As we talked about in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amQOwllDXWE\">separate technical video</a>, the 9800X3D has shifted the extra cache under the core complex, leading to more direct contact from the CPU cores to the IHS lid underside. AMD has also eliminated some of its bonding layers within the CPU, which reduces insulation further, and it has removed the structural silicon that leveled the top of the cache die to better mate the IHS in prior X3D designs. That’s because the extra cache die and the core complex die are now the same physical dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on November 6, 2024 as a video.

The <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> is about $476 now and is out of stock with a listed former price of $450 on Newegg. The 7800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31PwSpClk8\">our review</a>) has previously been as low as $300 to $330, with drops in August to around $360. Lately, its price has stabilized higher. We have a policy of making comparisons against pricing at the time of the review, so we’ll use the $476-$480 figure today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a> is priced at $187 to $230. The 7950X (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRaJXZMOMPU\">our review</a>) is a similar price to the 9800X3D, landing at about $500. That’d be one to pay attention to for non-gaming workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s competition includes the <a href=\"https://howl.link/tqzjvl93yihv6\">285K</a>, to the extent you can even call it “competition,” seeing as it barely competes with Intel’s own parts on value. The 285K(read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">our review</a>) is $630 where it can be found, and you shouldn’t buy it, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/r2e89d3f7fdac\">265K</a>(watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cqSz4k_HDs\">our review</a>) at $400. The prior generation parts, like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/x8t9qmerfhqkt\">14900K</a>, have fallen in price lately. That’s at $440, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> at $347.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a lot to get through, so let’s get into the benchmarks. We’ll have frequency, gaming, efficiency, and production tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"frequency-comparison\">AMD 9800X3D Frequency Comparison</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>AMD 9800X3D All-Core Frequency Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frequency%20Comparison%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20in%20Blender%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4821\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ccdc0097-fe01-43ac-ac64-59d8f0f3c6b4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We’ll start with a comparison of frequency against the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a>. This will help explain the performance differences we’re going to see today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an all-core workload with Blender, we observed the 9800X3D maintaining an average all-core frequency at a fixed 5225 MHz without any dropping. The stability and flatness of this frequency is a result of the higher power limit, which is allowing the core all the power it needs to maintain this boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D averaged between 4800 and 4890 MHz during the original review cycle for this same test. It’s significantly lower and less fixed, shown by the line’s variability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>AMD 9800X3D Single-Core Frequency Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frequency%20Comparison%20%28Max%201T%20in%20CB%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4822\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"34a60eca-3c77-48d9-bb85-c21ae128891b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In a single-thread comparison with Cinebench, the 9800X3D also held a maximum single-core boost of 5225 MHz throughout the duration of the test. The 7800X3D held at 5050 MHz in the same test as a maximum single-core frequency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between these two tests, the 9800X3D holds a significant frequency advantage over its predecessor in both all-core and single-core loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>VID Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20VID%20Comparison%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20VID%20in%20Blender%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4823\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"06dfb726-fe50-48c3-936c-eddffc5cb9ef\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We also ran a voltage ID comparison just with software. In Blender, the 9800X3D held a VID of 1.18V on average, with the 7800X3D at about 1.07V. The 7800X3D is power limited and also running at lower clocks, which combine to yield a lower VID.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"thermal-benchmark\"><strong>AMD 9800X3D Thermal Benchmark</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Thermal%20Benchmark%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20in%20Blender%29%20_%209800X3D%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4824\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b4c3ce73-d345-41e4-a21d-9af9d7749bb8\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Using the same Blender all-core workload, we measured a Tdie CPU temperature of approximately 77 degrees Celsius in a 21-degree Celsius environment when using a 360mm Liquid Freezer II at 100% pump and fan speeds. CPU die average was similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The L3 cache plotted just over 50 degrees Celsius, with the CPU IOD temperatures around 41 degrees with hotspot readings at about 50 degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D cannot be directly compared to the 7800X3D thermally by using internal sensors picked up by software. It would be erroneous without accounting for the changes AMD has made in its sensors. The AMD temperature sensors have been relocated within the silicon and moved to cooler locations to prevent clock dropping too early. We talked about this in our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">9700X review</a> and provided a controlled comparison so you can better understand why the sensor readout isn't directly comparable between the architectures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>9700X vs. 9800X3D Thermals</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Thermal%20Benchmark%20%28All-Core%20AVG%20in%20Blender%29%20_%209800X3D%20%26%209700X%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4825\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b1222e3e-ee64-4e47-b0a5-2f6449be5552\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>It can be directly compared to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rvrnysl2yqoos\">9700X</a>, though. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0D6NMDNNX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9700X</a> pulls less power in this test and so will be cooler, but it’ll still help to compare. The 9700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/wasted-opportunity-amd-ryzen-7-9700x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-7700x-more\">our review</a>) ran a Tdie of about 52 degrees Celsius under the same test conditions and with the same cooler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With PBO maxed-out on the 9700X, we saw about a 13W higher power draw than the 9800X3D stock. This landed the 9700X at about 86 degrees Celsius. It isn’t perfectly comparable because the power isn’t exactly matched and we ultimately don’t have an easy way to directly compare the 7800X3D’s thermals from the cache change without solutions that require more time than AMD gives in a review cycle. Even still, the key takeaway is that the 9800X3D is not burning the cores at excessive temperatures even with the stacked solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"9800x3d-gaming-benchmarks\"><strong>AMD 9800X3D Gaming Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

Lower is better, with the result measured in seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zen 5 has already shown advantages in this test, with the 9700X previously scoring the new top rank in the benchmark and outmatching all prior CPUs. Core count has limited benefit in this beyond 8 cores for AMD, but IPC and clocks seem to matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D absolutely crushes the prior top result, with a 25.8-second result against the 9700X’s already barrier-breaking 30.3-second result. This previously appeared to be a limitation of the memory, which we can see reinforced by the 31.1-second 285K result at DDR5-8600 vs. the stock result at 32.5. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original X3D CPU with the 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>) posted a 35.4-second result against the 40.7 result of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5800X-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0815XFSGK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5800X</a>, so we’re seeing a repeat of that era, which was also impressive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D also reduces the 7800X3D’s simulation time by 17.6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel’s best showing is the 285K with faster memory, but that’s not a like-for-like comparison as we could boost memory on AMD also. The 285K stock required 32.5 seconds to complete the simulation, meaning the 9800X3D reduces time required by 21%. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7950X3D-Hexadeca-core-Processor/dp/B0BTRH9MNS?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X3D</a> shows why we haven’t retested it, underperforming overall for reasons explained in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gCzXdLmjPY\">review</a> of the part. Even with the new data, it underperforms vs. the 7800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i9-14900K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJDKLB8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14900K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a> are effectively tied and within error of each other, and removing any limits wouldn’t change that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great showing for the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Dragon%27s%20Dogma%202%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4876\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"339ba3bd-6967-4ca4-b6a0-a04e32f7497d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 is up now, another of our 2024 titles. This game, even with all its updates to improve CPU performance, is still heavy on CPUs. The 9800X3D distances itself from the 7800X3D with a 16.2% uplift, gaining on the original 111 FPS AVG to an impressive 129 FPS AVG. We reran this one multiple times to ensure the result was right, but it ended up not even being our biggest gain in the suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gain on the 14900K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intels-300w-core-i9-14900k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>)was about 17%, up from 109.6 FPS AVG. The same is true of the prior 5800X3D. Over the 285K, we saw a 23% uplift. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frametimes were improved in this game, but not as much as we saw in some other games. The improvement is more or less proportional to the average framerate, so there is no particularly impressive divergence in lows. In other words, it tracks with what we’d expect of a 129 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FFXIV Dawntrail - 1080p</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20Benchmark%20v1-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_6.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4877\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b3964655-af7b-426b-b624-cd2b39ca5395\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail is up now, released this year. The 9800X3D breaks the previous upper bound of the chart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s run through the flagships: The 9800X3D CPU ran at 373 FPS AVG, which has it at 5.6% higher framerate than the 7800X3D while costing the same as the current 7800X3D pricing at time of writing. The 14900K ran at 310.3 FPS AVG, giving the 9800X3D a massive lead of 20.2%. This is one of the games where the new Arrow Lake CPUs are hugely regressive and impressively bad value, so the 285K’s 270 FPS AVG gives the 9800X3D an overwhelming lead of 38.3% higher average framerate. As for the 5800X3D, the lead is 11.8% over the prior AMD gaming flagship’s 334 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some anchors to older parts: The R7 2700 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-2023-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-7800x3d-cpu-upgrades\">our revisit</a>) and 2600 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-2600x-1600-af-2024-revisit-vs-5800x3d-7800x3d-more-cpu-benchmarks\">our revisit</a>) were around 145 to 150 FPS AVG, with the 2600 benefiting from a frequency advantage. The 3600 (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3489-amd-ryzen-5-3600-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-intel\">our review</a>) was at 170 FPS AVG. The Intel <a href=\"https://howl.link/9ve4vm89fhxl5\">12100F</a> is down at 186 FPS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FFXIV Dawntrail Frametimes</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frametime%20Comparison%20%28FFXIV%201080p_Max%29%20_%209800X3D%20vs%207800X3D%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4829\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dae104b0-4094-41ae-b0b5-63743866a922\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>For frametimes, we observed overall similar frame-to-frame intervals for the 9800X3D and 7800X3D.

The spikes are what matter: The 9800X3D in this title has slightly shorter excursions from the mean than the 7800X3D. The difference is hardly perceptible, but on a technicality, the 9800X3D does deliver more consistent frametimes in this title.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 from 2023 is up next. We want to caveat this one with a disclaimer: We saw a larger than typical gain in the 9800X3D versus the 7800X3D for this. After we spent a day troubleshooting it, we have come to the conclusion that there is no evidence to suggest any testing errors or uncharacteristic issues caused by the test or game itself, so we’re going to run the data because it’s interesting. We’d pull it if we had any substantiated concerns. We checked with two other reviewers in peer review, ran HWINFO logging, reran the tests multiple times on both the 9800X3D and 7800X3D, and came to the same conclusions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_6.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4878\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2806f410-8591-48b8-8de3-9f1cfa636761\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The game has the 9800X3D way up at 160 FPS AVG, leading the 7800X3D by an obscene 26.9%.

We think this is why the performance is so disproportionately good: There’s a much higher power budget, so we’re not trimming the frequency peaks, and the power consumption itself overall isn’t excessive in this game. The two combine for full boosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plotting the 7800X3D, we see a much spikier, less predictable average all-core frequency that bounces between 4500 MHz and about 5050 MHz under load.

It at least gives perspective that you may not see big differences in heavily bound scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K ran at 586 FPS AVG here, so the 9800X3D has a 10% improvement. The new X3D part is also about 10% over the 285K. Compared to the 5800X3D, the 9800X3D gains 12% in AVG FPS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We removed some other CPUs from this one to make space for APO on results. As a reminder, APO is now doing little for performance in any of our tests. This includes Rainbow Six, which previously saw larger impact. The 14900K is about 10 FPS different with APO on.

The 5800X3D ran at 457 FPS AVG, so a 7% gain for the 9800X3D. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/4ghp383hb0p2b\">14600K</a> with its recent rerun we ran landed it up alongside the 14700K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-desperate-i7-14700k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>), with both encountering the same bottleneck as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF57FL5?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">13700K</a> and the 7800X3D.

The 9700X scored 1389 MIPS/W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D ends up relatively efficient in compression, but less efficient than the prior 7800X3D. The 7800X3D was not a higher performer, but because this is a calculation of both power and performance, either one can help to counterbalance a deficit in the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Intel’s 285K measured at 1051 MIPS/W, which is improved upon its prior efficiency performance in the 14900K, which was way down at 672 MIPS/W. That’s with the EPS12V and ATX12V line measured on the 285K. The AMD CPUs do not pull from ATX12V in any meaningful way in our testing. The PCIe slot is isolated, as are fans and RGB LEDs. 5V from I/O is also isolated. This means there is some overhead in ATX12V on Intel from the RAM and other small devices, but nowhere near enough to meaningfully move that needle closer to AMD.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4838\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"97cc4f0a-de52-4383-99a0-a3c511a1218c\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Decompression efficiency is up now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, the 9800X3D ends up at 1482 MIPS/W, just under the 5600X (which is benefitted by its 60W power reading) and above the 7950X at 183W.

The 9800X3D trades efficiency for more boosting headroom.

The 9700X was regressive in this test against both the 7700X and the more like-for-like power 7700.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D leads the 7800X3D by 10.2% and the 9700X by similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again though, if you’re heavily represented by this test, you’d be better off with a different CPU. The 16-core AMD CPUs lead this chart and set that example. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/xr7k4bh8wiurc\">7950X</a> has been below $500 lately, so it’d be a price comparable alternative to the 9800X3D that’s more suited to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Chromium Compile</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Chromium%20Code%20Compile%20%28Windows%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4846\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a1f6d464-4b68-4b6b-98cc-2b09e2b6c934\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Chromium compile is up now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9800X3D requires 130 minutes to complete the compile with our settings, putting it at the same level as the 14600K (read <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XscfA1dT60\">our review</a>) and Intel 245K.

The 7800X3D’s 10,162 point result gives the 9800X3D a lead of 17%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD does well in this specific Photoshop test right now. Intel’s first CPUs show up way down the chart, at around the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7600X-12-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBJDS62N?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7600X</a> (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM-twyjfYIw\">our review</a>)and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7900-24-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQK718H?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7900</a> levels of performance with the 14900K and 14700K. The 285K does about the same as the 13700K here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one where the 9800X3D manages to boost itself even in a non-gaming scenario, benefitted by the extra power available for clock boosting as compared to the 9700X.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Value Comparisons (USD/FPS)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20%E2%96%B3%20in%20USD_FPS%20at%20Various%207800X3D%20Prices%20%28Negative%20Favors%209800X3D%29%20_%20EXPERIMENTAL%20CHART%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4849\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"60db63f3-f49d-4aed-8c8a-49d13784c4a9\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This chart is an experiment. We don’t want you to place too much usefulness in this particular chart because it is experimental, but we also can’t try new things if we always try to perfect them first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This chart shows the delta in USD per FPS at various simulated prices for the 7800X3D. The 9800X3D is fixed at $480 in all of these simulations, with the 7800X3D variable based on the number you see in the chart legend on the right. A negative value means that the 9800X3D is that amount cheaper per FPS than the 7800X3D, while a positive value means the 9800X3D is that amount more expensive per FPS than the 7800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At near price parity, the 9800X3D has significant value advantages in Dragon’s Dogma 2, Baldur’s Gate 3, Starfield, and even Phantom Liberty. Value is functionally the same in F1, Rainbow Six, and Final Fantasy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t until a $420 price for the 7800X3D that the Starfield value gains are mostly eliminated. At $400 7800X3D versus $480 9800X3D, the 7800X3D starts to make a ton of sense as a better value, assuming that’s how you shop. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency vs. Performance Change</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20_%20Increase%20in%20Power%20vs.%20_%20Increase%20Performance%20%287800X3D%20to%209800X3D%29%20_%20EXPERIMENTAL%20CHART%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4850\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"404a0b26-5508-4c41-a26f-7f30088069fe\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This is also an experimental chart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, we’re showing the percent increase in power consumption for the application in the left axis vs. the percent increase in performance. The best result would be a larger performance increase than the power increase by percent, although linearity is also good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Baldur’s Gate and Stellaris, with the latter converted to simulations per hour so that higher is better, the percent performance increase is either improved or nearly linear with the percent power increase. In Starfield, the performance increase costs a substantial power increase. We saw the same in Phantom Liberty. These are our two most power-hungry games in the suite and fully leverage the power budget. 7-Zip also saw this swing. Dawntrail is bottlenecked, so can’t reliably be used. Even limited though, power is higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD might be past the most efficient point in the curve, but results like Stellaris support that it is still relatively balanced. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"9800x3d-conclusion\"><strong>AMD 9800X3D Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

After this impromptu hydrolysis reaction, there aren’t many compelling reasons to pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap some key points quickly:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-07-12h59m10s575.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4851\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5d431289-d59e-498e-b356-b0cc430ef579\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 9800X3D is definitely the new gaming king, and this time, it’s priced similarly to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a>. The original launch price of the 7800X3D was $450. Even at that price, the 9800X3D is a worthwhile improvement and doesn’t feel like stagnation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some big boosts to performance over the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a>: Stellaris saw the 9800X3D break through a glass ceiling and propel to new heights against the already-dominant 7800X3D; Starfield saw about a 16% improvement; Dragon’s Dogma 2 saw a 16% uplift, also breaking through what seemed like a ceiling; Baldur’s Gate 3 had a 26-27% improvement, which was such a big swing that we re-ran the tests on both CPUs, collected HWINFO logs during execution, and closely inspected the graphics to ensure equal renders. We also checked with another reviewer who saw a 17% uplift in the game while testing in a different area and under different settings, which is close enough when considering those changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without that, the CPU is just overall competitive in gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For efficiency, the 9800X3D doesn’t manage to hold onto AMD’s multi-generation history of its new X3D CPU becoming the most efficient in our charts. The CPU is still good, and we’d still classify it as “efficient” overall when considering everything else on the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Production isn’t as competitive as other parts, so if you’re not building a gaming-first system, you should just buy a different CPU. But it’s good enough for a mix of work and high-end gaming, and likewise, it uncharacteristically improves upon the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rvrnysl2yqoos\">9700X</a>. We haven’t always seen this with X3D, as frequency is typically sacrificed for power as a result of the thermal limiters imposed by the heat sandwich AMD previously had with the stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel isn’t anywhere close on the gaming charts. It isn’t only beaten, its new 285K flagship -- which is, for some completely insane reason, $630 -- is sometimes beaten by 40-60%. Typically, we’re seeing 25-35% when unbound by the GPU. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel does better in the production benchmarks, but we still wouldn’t recommend the Ultra 200 series broadly. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/nuicv57sgirwo\">9950X</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X</a> remain competitive, with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/x8t9qmerfhqkt\">14900K</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> also somewhat competitive here. There are some very limited use cases, such as the buzzworded “creation” scenarios, where the 285K makes some sense. But Intel is marketing the 285K on efficiency, and AMD is more efficient in every test we’ve run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire last few months have been wild: We watched AMD open it up with Zen 5, where it drunkenly fumbled the football back 5 yards on the field. Intel then picked up the ball and proceeded to run towards its own goal, at which point it tripped over its shoe laces that came unglued. AMD then picked the ball up and walked it the rest of the way with the 9800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And somehow, it worked. AMD was set up for a slam dunk on this launch with both its own and Intel’s fumbles, and by under-marketing the performance, it was in a position where only the price could screw the launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This launch was also the most organized out of the last several months, including AMD’s own Zen 5 launch. An organized launch is important: With about 2 weeks of testing time rather than the few days we’ve had, plus a mature platform without mid-testing reworks, it is clear that AMD really sat down and planned the launch rather than shoving it out the door in a panic to respond to something else. This gives us some additional confidence that there won’t be any unexpected, major problems with issues like BSODs or BIOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it for the 9800X3D review. You have all the numbers to make decisions. The 7800X3D may make more sense in the event its price falls significantly, but overall and all things totaled, we’re positive on this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Prices for both Intel’s 13th and 14th Series CPUs have recently dropped, as have some of AMD’s Zen 5 CPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> is as cheap as $350 right now, which makes it a direct alternative to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/n1h000hp9r3x4\">245K</a>, despite buying into an older platform. It has at least gotten microcode updates that should resolve the major concerns. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/4ghp383hb0p2b\">14600K</a> is $225-$250 now, which is about the same price as the AMD 9600X. The 13600K is dwindling in supply, but $225 lately. The 12900K is also cheaper than the 245K, despite being on a pretty old platform, and is $280-$300. AMD’s 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>) is around $210-$230 now, making it a key upgrade pathway for AM4 users. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> is priced out of this territory, up at $480 typically. Keep in mind that a 9800X3D -- or whatever they end up calling it -- is due out on November 7th.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-04-13h40m32s891.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4793\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e5796c90-7fd1-4fe6-be34-e55269486edf\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s a slide showing the basic specs. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/tqzjvl93yihv6\">285K</a> is a 24-thread part and has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores. Intel ditched hyper-threading, so it’s just the two core counts combined for thread-count. The 245K is a 14-thread part and has an advertised boost of up to 5.2GHz. Overall, Intel is focusing heavily on power consumption reductions and efficiency improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">285K review</a>, we saw several areas where the CPU regressed in gaming performance. This complicates efficiency, because if the CPU is doing less work but also lower power, it’s not a clean improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"efficiency-testing\"><strong>Intel Core Ultra 5 245K Efficiency Testing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This section gets into efficiency testing. There are some really important details in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXLY8kEdR1c\">285K review</a> that you need to see to fully understand and appreciate this section. We’re not going to go through it all again here. The most important part is that ASUS is directing some power through the ATX12V cables on the 24-pin connectors now, so we can’t rely on purely EPS12V. We’re going to leave a lot of detail out here on the assumption you got it in the <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">longer review</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4794\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ebf7a528-f930-49cf-b2b7-2d84b38cb7bc\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In 7-Zip compression efficiency testing, we measured the 245K with EPS12V and ATX12V at 108.1W on average, which produced a MIPS/W rating of 1130.6, or in other words, 1130.6 million instructions per Joule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 245K outranked the 285K’s efficiency in the same test, meaning that the 285K is beyond the optimum point in the curve for efficiency. It’s still improved over the preceding <a href=\"https://howl.link/x8t9qmerfhqkt\">14900K</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i5-14600K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ9STNF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14600K</a> scored 768.3 MIPS/W here at 166.5W, so the 245K is improved in efficiency. The 245K’s performance in Compression MIPS is actually lower than the 14600K’s (read <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XscfA1dT60\">our review</a>), but its power consumption dropped so drastically (even with ATX12V measured) that it has measuredly improved in efficiency, at 47% more efficient than the 14600K. Adding the 5V line includes I/O and so isn’t perfect, but even that is more efficient. We talk about why we add both in the 285K review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD remains the leader, with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NN6TM7?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9600X</a> at 1152.8 MIPS/W, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a> at 1281, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7700-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQHSCVF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7700</a> non-X at 1436.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4795\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"819d470e-d741-4628-9c16-9a380cf229b3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>7-Zip decompression uses power from the same test since we combine them, but has different scores. In this one, the 245K held a score of 1090 MIP/W. Its actual MIPS throughput, which we’ll show later, is significantly behind the 14600K, so the efficiency percentage uplift is dragged down by regressive performance, despite the total power reduction. The improvement over the 14600K’s 821.9 result is 32.6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closest score in MIPS throughput to this is the 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>), which is just outside of error. The 5800X3D and 245K are therefore completing about the same output and are normalized in this way, allowing the 5800X3D a staggering lead of 28% more efficiency than the 245K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4796\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"373ab276-c775-4678-95b5-8af972aec427\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Baldur’s Gate 3 efficiency, the 245K ran at 71.5W and scored 1.3 FPS/W. That has it tied in efficiency with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rjwzgawup8ztw\">R7 7700</a> and it tied with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0D6NMDNNX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9700X</a> which wasn’t distant. These three CPUs can be looked at as nearly work-normalized, or FPS-normalized, in addition to scoring the same efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5800X3D has a substantial framerate lead and runs at only 65.7W, giving it a 1.8 FPS/W result at 38.5% more efficient than the 245K. The 5700X3D has a larger lead with its 51.1W result and is also typically cheaper, though on an old platform now with old I/O support. Still, it’s impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing the 245K to the 14600K, the lead is 44% uplift in efficiency compared to the 14600K’s 0.9 FPS/W result. The 14600K also had a slightly lower framerate in this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: FFXIV Dawntrail</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4797\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aeec17e2-28ea-4d5a-bbd9-ca425889e751\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail, the 245K ran at 4.3 FPS/W and 51.8W, putting it behind the 9600X (which has a significantly higher framerate but about 10-11W higher power consumption) and ahead of the 14600K. The improvement over the 14600K’s 3.6 FPS/W result is 19%. The 5700X3D crushes here, up at 7.7 FPS/W and leading the 245K by 80% thanks to its lower power and its higher framerate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Stellaris</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20%28Simulations%20Per%20Watt-Hour%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4798\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"90b0df87-92ed-42d5-9010-66ad634b9fa4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Stellaris shows us simulations per Watt-hour, so higher is better despite the test being in seconds (with lower being better). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this test, the 245K ran at 53.5W and completes 1.9 simulations per Watt-hour. That has it about tied with the 5800X3D, which likewise is roughly tied in power consumption. These are good direct comparisons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5700X3D’s power consumption drop benefits it greatly here, although it slows down in simulation time. Its score is 2.4 simulations per Watt-hour, or an improvement over the 245K of 26%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the 14600K, the 245K improves by 46%. The 14600K is slower in simulation time here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"frequency-comparison\">Frequency Comparison</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Single-Core Frequency Comparison (14900K vs. 285K)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Frequency%20Comparison%20%28Max%201T%20in%20Cinebench%29%20_%20GamersNexus_all.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4799\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c07fbcd4-45af-4c8d-a837-7624380f9b88\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>We’ll look at maximum single-core frequency under a Cinebench workload first, just to verify that the CPU does what Intel advertises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K plotted at about 5700MHz during this workload, with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i9-14900K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJDKLB8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14900K</a> at 6000MHz.

The 245K leads the 14600K by 6.2% here. This is at least better than what we saw with the 14900K and 285K. The 14900K was also encroaching on memory limitations, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF57FL5?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">13700K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF54SR1?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">13900K</a> bouncing off of the same limit and the 285K with DDR5-8600 pushing ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the 285K’s like-for-like lead over the 245K, that’s 8% at 100 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stellaris Simulation Time</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20v3.13.1%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus%20%282%29.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4807\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7aa31975-39fd-482c-b47b-0c4a934a7da7\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Stellaris is up next for something different.

Zen 5 does well in this particular benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the 14600K, the 245K benefits from a simulation time requirement reduction of 4.6%. The 245K also leads the 5700X3D with a simulation time reduction of 8.9%, with the 5700X3D falling back from its reduced frequency. The 285K reduces the time requirement from the 245K to 32.5 seconds, or reducing the time by about 7%.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-04-14h04m42s739.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4809\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cfbceba5-3367-4a49-9636-ee466ac1ff3b\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Rainbow Six Siege is next.

Intra-architecture, the 285K leads the 245K by a noteworthy 22.6% -- though we still don’t recommend it against alternatives mentioned in the 285K review.

In Photoshop, the 245K improved on the 14600K technically, but AMD still holds a massive lead in this particular test. Premiere was a cleaner victory for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/n1h000hp9r3x4\">245K</a>, improving on the 14600K and reducing power draw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming had the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-245K/dp/B0DFK2P311?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">245K</a> down around the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7700-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQHSCVF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7700</a> levels in Baldur’s Gate 3 and ahead of the <a href=\"https://howl.link/nbrwjipoctmpk\">9600X</a>, but getting crushed by the <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a>, 5600X3D, and obviously the <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a>. Although the 245K’s relative positioning against the <a href=\"https://howl.link/nbrwjipoctmpk\">9600X</a> and 14600K flip-flopped, like in F1 where it was remarkably non-competitive, the global constant was that X3D outperformed the 245K. Fortunately for Intel, AMD doesn’t have any modern platform X3D CPUs that are in this price range. Until it replaces the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a> in price with an AM5 part, Intel will at least have an advantage in fully modernized I/O despite disadvantages elsewhere like in raw performance as compared to something like an AM4 platform build, which is also just building into a close-to-EOL ecosystem.<br />Intel’s strongest argument right now is in the non-gaming workloads, but like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/tqzjvl93yihv6\">285K</a>, we just think the 245K has too much fierce competition to make sense at the moment. The efficiency improvement is important, and we talk at length about the power cost savings in the <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">285K review</a> to calculate it across several years of ownership. It’s good that they improved there. It’s just that this platform (1) isn’t really ready, having already half a dozen major bugs leading into launch, and (2) is embattled on all sides by similarly priced or cheaper options.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

We really are leaving a lot of detail, but that’s because it’d be complete repeat information and is the same. We’ll focus mostly on charts today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Intel Core Ultra 5 245K Price Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the price comparison. These prices were taken in the week before reviews are going live, so they may change by the time it publishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Price Comparison | GamersNexusLate October, 2024</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Newegg Price</strong></td><td><strong>Amazon Price</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel 245K (MSRP $310)</strong></td><td>$330</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel 14700K</strong></td><td>$375</td><td>$350</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel 14600K</strong></td><td>$250</td><td>$225</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel 13700K</strong></td><td>$350</td><td>$290</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel 13600K</strong></td><td>N/A</td><td>$225</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel 12900K</strong></td><td>$300</td><td>$280</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel 12600KF</strong></td><td>$160</td><td>$160</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 9700X</strong></td><td>$330</td><td>$330</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 9600X</strong></td><td>$250</td><td>$250</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 7900</strong></td><td>$370</td><td>$370</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 7700X</strong></td><td>$275</td><td>$275</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 7600</strong></td><td>$200</td><td>$200</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 5950X</strong></td><td>$350</td><td>$350</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 5700X3D</strong></td><td>$230</td><td>$210</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD 7800X3D</strong></td><td>$480</td><td>$480</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Here’s the list. Prices for both Intel’s 13th and 14th Series CPUs have recently dropped, as have some of AMD’s Zen 5 CPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.link/6itwi4penev36\">14700K</a> is as cheap as $350 right now, which makes it a direct alternative to the <a href=\"https://howl.link/n1h000hp9r3x4\">245K</a>, despite buying into an older platform. It has at least gotten microcode updates that should resolve the major concerns. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/4ghp383hb0p2b\">14600K</a> is $225-$250 now, which is about the same price as the AMD 9600X. The 13600K is dwindling in supply, but $225 lately. The 12900K is also cheaper than the 245K, despite being on a pretty old platform, and is $280-$300. AMD’s 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>) is around $210-$230 now, making it a key upgrade pathway for AM4 users. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a> is priced out of this territory, up at $480 typically. Keep in mind that a 9800X3D -- or whatever they end up calling it -- is due out on November 7th.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-04-13h40m32s891.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4793\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e5796c90-7fd1-4fe6-be34-e55269486edf\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s a slide showing the basic specs. The <a href=\"https://howl.link/tqzjvl93yihv6\">285K</a> is a 24-thread part and has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores. Intel ditched hyper-threading, so it’s just the two core counts combined for thread-count. The 245K is a 14-thread part and has an advertised boost of up to 5.2GHz. Overall, Intel is focusing heavily on power consumption reductions and efficiency improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">285K review</a>, we saw several areas where the CPU regressed in gaming performance. This complicates efficiency, because if the CPU is doing less work but also lower power, it’s not a clean improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"efficiency-testing\"><strong>Intel Core Ultra 5 245K Efficiency Testing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This section gets into efficiency testing. There are some really important details in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXLY8kEdR1c\">285K review</a> that you need to see to fully understand and appreciate this section. We’re not going to go through it all again here. The most important part is that ASUS is directing some power through the ATX12V cables on the 24-pin connectors now, so we can’t rely on purely EPS12V. We’re going to leave a lot of detail out here on the assumption you got it in the <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">longer review</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4794\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ebf7a528-f930-49cf-b2b7-2d84b38cb7bc\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In 7-Zip compression efficiency testing, we measured the 245K with EPS12V and ATX12V at 108.1W on average, which produced a MIPS/W rating of 1130.6, or in other words, 1130.6 million instructions per Joule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 245K outranked the 285K’s efficiency in the same test, meaning that the 285K is beyond the optimum point in the curve for efficiency. It’s still improved over the preceding <a href=\"https://howl.link/x8t9qmerfhqkt\">14900K</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i5-14600K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ9STNF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14600K</a> scored 768.3 MIPS/W here at 166.5W, so the 245K is improved in efficiency. The 245K’s performance in Compression MIPS is actually lower than the 14600K’s (read <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XscfA1dT60\">our review</a>), but its power consumption dropped so drastically (even with ATX12V measured) that it has measuredly improved in efficiency, at 47% more efficient than the 14600K. Adding the 5V line includes I/O and so isn’t perfect, but even that is more efficient. We talk about why we add both in the 285K review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD remains the leader, with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NN6TM7?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9600X</a> at 1152.8 MIPS/W, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a> at 1281, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7700-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQHSCVF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7700</a> non-X at 1436.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4795\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"819d470e-d741-4628-9c16-9a380cf229b3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>7-Zip decompression uses power from the same test since we combine them, but has different scores. In this one, the 245K held a score of 1090 MIP/W. Its actual MIPS throughput, which we’ll show later, is significantly behind the 14600K, so the efficiency percentage uplift is dragged down by regressive performance, despite the total power reduction. The improvement over the 14600K’s 821.9 result is 32.6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closest score in MIPS throughput to this is the 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>), which is just outside of error. The 5800X3D and 245K are therefore completing about the same output and are normalized in this way, allowing the 5800X3D a staggering lead of 28% more efficiency than the 245K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4796\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"373ab276-c775-4678-95b5-8af972aec427\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Baldur’s Gate 3 efficiency, the 245K ran at 71.5W and scored 1.3 FPS/W. That has it tied in efficiency with the <a href=\"https://howl.link/rjwzgawup8ztw\">R7 7700</a> and it tied with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0D6NMDNNX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9700X</a> which wasn’t distant. These three CPUs can be looked at as nearly work-normalized, or FPS-normalized, in addition to scoring the same efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5800X3D has a substantial framerate lead and runs at only 65.7W, giving it a 1.8 FPS/W result at 38.5% more efficient than the 245K. The 5700X3D has a larger lead with its 51.1W result and is also typically cheaper, though on an old platform now with old I/O support. Still, it’s impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing the 245K to the 14600K, the lead is 44% uplift in efficiency compared to the 14600K’s 0.9 FPS/W result. The 14600K also had a slightly lower framerate in this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: FFXIV Dawntrail</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4797\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aeec17e2-28ea-4d5a-bbd9-ca425889e751\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail, the 245K ran at 4.3 FPS/W and 51.8W, putting it behind the 9600X (which has a significantly higher framerate but about 10-11W higher power consumption) and ahead of the 14600K. The improvement over the 14600K’s 3.6 FPS/W result is 19%. The 5700X3D crushes here, up at 7.7 FPS/W and leading the 245K by 80% thanks to its lower power and its higher framerate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Stellaris</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20%28Simulations%20Per%20Watt-Hour%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4798\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"90b0df87-92ed-42d5-9010-66ad634b9fa4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Stellaris shows us simulations per Watt-hour, so higher is better despite the test being in seconds (with lower being better). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this test, the 245K ran at 53.5W and completes 1.9 simulations per Watt-hour. That has it about tied with the 5800X3D, which likewise is roughly tied in power consumption. These are good direct comparisons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5700X3D’s power consumption drop benefits it greatly here, although it slows down in simulation time. Its score is 2.4 simulations per Watt-hour, or an improvement over the 245K of 26%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the 14600K, the 245K improves by 46%.

The $250 i7-13700K gives the 245K a serious run for its higher cost though, at 10616 points. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K posts a large uplift over the 245K, at 15% higher in score. This was one of the more favorable tests for Arrow Lake with the 285K. That’s true too of the 245K, but there are better value alternatives (like the 13700K - especially now that Intel claims the microcode issue is fixed).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Adobe%20Photoshop%20%28Puget%20Suite%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4816\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3b9be9b6-3c56-4ac6-bdbd-6152ef1db423\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Adobe Photoshop is dominated by AMD in the current iteration of the software and Puget test.

That doesn’t mean, however, that it makes sense to purchase an Arrow Lake CPU. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-11-04-13h41m58s904.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4817\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1e0d3a77-5c8f-46b0-8669-16fcd8145ef5\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Even catching the ATX12V power changes on our ASUS board, the CPU is lower power consumption and higher efficiency, even when it sometimes regresses in performance. Some games saw improved performance and lower power consumption, like Stellaris, which resulted in larger uplift than areas where we saw heavy performance regression, like Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail as compared to CPUs like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/4ghp383hb0p2b\">14600K</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In production workloads, we saw regression from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i5-14600K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ9STNF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14600K</a> in 7-Zip compression (though it still beats the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0D6NMDNNX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9700X</a> there, so that’s impressive) and a few other areas. In Photoshop, the 245K improved on the 14600K technically, but AMD still holds a massive lead in this particular test. Premiere was a cleaner victory for the <a href=\"https://howl.link/n1h000hp9r3x4\">245K</a>, improving on the 14600K and reducing power draw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming had the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-245K/dp/B0DFK2P311?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">245K</a> down around the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7700-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BMQHSCVF?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7700</a> levels in Baldur’s Gate 3 and ahead of the <a href=\"https://howl.link/nbrwjipoctmpk\">9600X</a>, but getting crushed by the <a href=\"https://howl.link/ln0w2njw3ss3w\">5700X3D</a>, 5600X3D, and obviously the <a href=\"https://howl.link/hqawfkbuksdil\">7800X3D</a>. Although the 245K’s relative positioning against the <a href=\"https://howl.link/nbrwjipoctmpk\">9600X</a> and 14600K flip-flopped, like in F1 where it was remarkably non-competitive, the global constant was that X3D outperformed the 245K. Fortunately for Intel, AMD doesn’t have any modern platform X3D CPUs that are in this price range. Until it replaces the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a> in price with an AM5 part, Intel will at least have an advantage in fully modernized I/O despite disadvantages elsewhere like in raw performance as compared to something like an AM4 platform build, which is also just building into a close-to-EOL ecosystem.<br />Intel’s strongest argument right now is in the non-gaming workloads, but like the <a href=\"https://howl.link/tqzjvl93yihv6\">285K</a>, we just think the 245K has too much fierce competition to make sense at the moment. The efficiency improvement is important, and we talk at length about the power cost savings in the <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/get-it-together-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-9950x-more\">285K review</a> to calculate it across several years of ownership. It’s good that they improved there. It’s just that this platform (1) isn’t really ready, having already half a dozen major bugs leading into launch, and (2) is embattled on all sides by similarly priced or cheaper options.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

More specs can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhIXt1svQZg\">Arrow Lake announcement coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"not-ready-for-launch\"><strong>Not Ready for Launch</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First off: Arrow Lake really doesn’t seem ready for launch. Intel told us this about Arrow Lake in a briefing:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The big change is that every ODM now, without fail, every ODM ships with this [APO] enabled. In the BIOS, the Camarillo device is turned on, there’ll be a yellow bang, the driver will install, and APO will be enabled by default. That’s the out-of-box-experience everybody is going to have. You’d want to mimic what folks are going to see.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is going to be something that is going to be probably just as important as the hardware improvements. [...] All your ODMs, the board vendors, it’s all enabled by default and should auto-install, 13th Gen onward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is important because we don’t test with APO so we had to consider it for this review. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel presented first-party benchmark slides with APO enabled and emphasized with us that not only would it be on by default with Z890, but that it would also be on by default with Z790. Neither was true. We discovered this issue and brought it to Intel only because we weren’t sure if it was our fault, and it wasn’t. The company seemed totally unaware of this failing and, after some back-and-forth, eventually realized it had simply screwed up. As a result of our findings, Intel is moving to publish a list of motherboards that support APO out of the box on by default in BIOS going forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that’s great for consumers so that it clears up the misleading nature of the original claims, this product is clearly not ready if we’re the ones beta testing such strong statements as “without fail” for a feature that wasn’t present, as pointless as it often is. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h16m57s024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4747\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"97b2a140-c476-4665-bc4f-0b1a10a516ad\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Dynamic Tuning also no longer exists on our board, despite Intel telling us that it should be present and enabled. The option has been renamed to Innovation Platform Framework and was off by default, which meant APO was off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the latest microcode and BIOS on Z790 for these reviews, we also found that APO was off by default for those platforms as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We consider APO off the default user experience for the product as Intel shipped it to us; however, we tested with both. APO was ultimately irrelevant in our test suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was one of many unforced errors from Intel, with others including BSODs on Windows install due to a driver conflict with NVIDIA devices when the IGP is enabled. This issue did not exist on prior architectures and seems to be a combination of the new IGP claiming the PCIE resources and of NVIDIA’s driver code not having an error handler for 0 PCIE resource availability. You can bypass it by disabling the IGP, but for a lot of people, this will be frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform also has some issues with Easy Anti-Cheat, which Intel will soon be publishing a statement about, but we’ll leave that to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Level1Techs\">Wendell’s coverage</a>, but basically, if you disable security features, you’re able to work around the issue. We just wouldn’t recommend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h17m15s872.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4748\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2b3068eb-62af-40a7-b876-13ca24f3c404\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Additionally, Intel sent a statement about power profiles where balanced power on 24H2 results in uncharacteristically bad performance.

This is likely a board-to-board thing, not Arrow Lake as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin & EPS12V Power: 14900K (Baldur’s Gate)</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/power-distribution-bg3%28CUnet%29%28scale%29%28x2.000000%29.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4752\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"020baf03-1816-4f14-b35b-71cc30d1a7af\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Proving our work: This plot shows the 14900K’s power draw in a known workload spread across multiple rails. You can see that EPS1 and EPS2 power is similar, both at around 70-80W in this lighter weight gaming workload. The 24-pin has several voltages, including 3.3V, 5V, 5VSB, and 12V shown here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATX12V rail includes things like fans, the CPU, and if we hadn’t isolated it, slot power, among other miscellaneous controllers on motherboards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slot power is around 30-35W, which is why it’s important to isolate it if capturing 24-pin power. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Slot Power Problems</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/slot-power-spike_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4753\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"971cd470-5153-42f2-bf44-bc38353a2d63\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s why we isolate slot power: This benchmark was for 7-Zip on the 14900K. The GPU does literally nothing in this test except spit out the display. It does not engage in the test. However, occasionally in any test, we measure seemingly random spikes to slot power. This could be for a number of unpredictable reasons, including innocuous ones like Windows background tasks or NVIDIA’s drivers doing something in the background, such as telemetry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin & EPS12V Power: 14900K vs. 285K</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the comparison we’ve wanted:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Power%20Consumption%20Distribution%20_%20i9-14900K%20vs.%20285K%20in%207-Zip%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4754\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a8fac24c-a56f-43d6-a953-404d3251c3c6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In 7-Zip, ignoring EPS12V, we noticed that the ATX12V power was exceptionally high on the 285K and Z890 Hero combination compared to the 14900K and Z790 Hero. It’s at about 50W here, whereas the 14900K had ATX12V down around 30W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ATX3V power is comparable on both and within 2W. ATX5V power isn’t easy to call a simple average since it fluctuates so much: The range is 14-30W on the 285K+ASUS combination and similar on the 14900K, with peaks about 3-5W lower than the 285K. We don’t know if any of that power is getting used for regulators that might feed the CPU, but if any of it is, it’s not much. A lot of it is driving other components, like I/O.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATX12V line is clearly important though, as not factoring-in that 20-30W difference in this test would mean representing the 285K as artificially efficient because the power is sort of “hidden” in a cable where it’s not typically meaningfully high. ASUS’ reasoning for this is theoretically better power regulation. We don’t know if anyone else is doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin Power: 7800X3D vs. 285K ATX12V</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as an example of AMD, here’s the 7800X3D and 285K.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/7800x3d-vs-285k-atx12v_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4755\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5520a4a3-63ec-4d7e-98a7-bd5d64105221\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 285K and 14900K ATX12V remains from last time. The 7800X3D was pulling about 12W ATX12V fixed during this test and didn’t seem to fluctuate based on load at all. It appears fairly isolated. Typically, this gap of 10W comes out in the wash when you’re talking a 280W 14900K versus an 80W 7800X3D, so it’s just part of the usual margins. In this scenario, however, the difference against the 285K really starts to show.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin Power: 7800X3D vs. 285K ATX3V</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/285k-vs-7800x3d_3v_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4756\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c907f4db-f225-49c4-b3e9-03539b510557\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s ATX3V. The 7800X3D platform is marginally higher here -- we’re using an ASUS board for this also. This is part of why 5V normally comes out in the wash: Some rails are a few Watts higher, some a few Watts lower. There is always going to be error.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin Power: 7800X3D vs. 285K ATX5V</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Power%20Consumption%20Distribution%20_%20i9-14900K%20vs.%20285K%20vs.%207800X3D%20ATX5V%20in%207-Zip%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4757\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2afae4be-0a65-4b77-a59b-7fbcd9b73241\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>ATX5V is about the same between them all. There is possibly spikier behavior on the 285K from the I/O, but that’s about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Software Readings</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All this is done with hardware. We also can’t trust various software readings because they can be manipulated heavily by software or motherboards. Years ago, there was an issue where AMD motherboards were underreporting the power in a way that allowed boards to pull more or less power while hiding it in software, thus manipulating the report. We also spoke with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kzGTOyCYrY\">Der8auer</a> about his experiences, and he noticed that CPU Package Power is calculated based on VID, so if anything is wrong with voltage, it will manifest in erroneous software readings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m00s441.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4758\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m00s441.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m00s441.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4758\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aaad0565-d430-48c1-9389-9fa53622803d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m02s787.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4759\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m02s787.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m02s787.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4759\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"191fa2ba-c0aa-4e50-a588-b69808aec488\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m04s448.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4760\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m04s448.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m04s448.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4760\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5563e146-92d2-4433-ba83-64fb215a83ef\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>And that leads us back to our monster we’ve built. We are fairly confident in the results, but we have to caveat that this is a very opaque platform currently and it’s not fully clear how all the power is routed. For the most part, it should be proportional to the VRM split of 18:4 of the 22 phases total, so we were able to use that as a guidepost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally: You might be asking “who measures the measurers,” and the answer is... us. Working with Elmor, we hooked up other current monitoring devices in series to monitor the current monitoring devices, and we also clamped the cables to monitor the monitoring of the monitoring devices while monitoring the software of the monitoring-monitoring devices and the CPU-monitoring software monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that was all done and we had tested against calibrated Fluke meters with known current loads, we proceeded with the most accurate combination of monitoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get into the efficiency testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4761\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8d7e09e4-5d0e-402c-86af-87ae89bdd27a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>7-Zip decompression efficiency is measured in MIPS/W, or millions of instructions per joule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this test, the 285K ended up in the lower-third of the chart. Intel’s 14900K pulled 273W in this test, with the 285K now at 162W for ATX12V and EPS12V without slot power, or 175W with ATX12V, ATX5V, and EPS12V. We think the 162W number is more accurate, but want to transparently present both since the power split is still not fully clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because performance is lower and the formula relies on both, the efficiency increase isn’t as impressive as the power drop. The 285K runs with an efficiency of 1101 MIPS/W decompression with the reading that includes 5V, or an improvement of 29% over the 14900K. The reading without 5V is 40% improved over the 14900K, which we think is the more accurate one. Whether 30% or 40% is closer, the point is that it’s a big uplift. AMD still dominates here, holding the entire top-third of the chart, though. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X</a> in ECO mode sets a seemingly untouchable score at 1936 MIPS/W.

The <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxpgEY9q9\">5700X3D</a> is about the same, with the 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>) slightly less efficient. Intel’s new 285K isn’t remotely close to these numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K with ATX12V and EPS12V ran at 1.1 FPS/W, so the 7800X3D is creating over 2x as many frames per Watt of power. The 14900K ran at 0.7 FPS/W here. Looking at just Intel, the 1.1 result of the 285K has at least improved substantially over the 14900K, with an uplift of 57%; if we include the 5V power, since we’re not certain if any of it is being used for the CPU, that would be a 29% uplift. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Starfield</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Starfield%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4764\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ff2e4287-7f96-4510-bab1-522e69c8a7ae\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Starfield is a heavier workload from gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, the 7800X3D is again the most efficient. Its result was 2.1 FPS/W, holding a large lead over the next closest CPUs. The next closest CPU is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a>, also at about 70W. The 5800X3D, <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxwYe9ib6\">9700X</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxy11FLO7\">7700</a> non-X follow this. We eventually hit the 3700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-r7-3700x-r5-3600-2024-revisit-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-5700x3d-more\">our revisit</a>), then the 285K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the ATX12V and EPS12V measurements and without PCIe slot, we end up at about 147W for a 1.0 FPS/W rating with the usual rounding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K ran at 0.7 FPS/W here, so Intel has improved by 43%. Its Ultra 9 is now about where the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxC8PRq3u\">14600K</a> was previously. Measuring 5V as well had it at 172W, or 0.8 FPS/W. That would instead be an improvement of 14%. As before, we believe the 1.0 figure is closer to reality, but it likely falls in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Stellaris</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20%28Simulations%20Per%20Watt-Hour%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4765\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1b3456db-17d4-4faf-b166-c4eded56b396\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The next game is Stellaris, where we measured simulation time in seconds and power.

The next closest is down at 2.4 with the 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K ran 1.5 simulations per Watt-hour. That means for each watt-hour, the 7800X3D is able to complete 1.2 more simulations, or about an 80% increase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K completed 0.9 simulations per Watt-hour. That means the 285K’s best entry is an improvement of 67% in efficiency. Remember: Most of Intel’s presented numbers were only for power reductions, not necessarily for efficiency. The 285K’s simulation performance is better than the 14900K’s in this benchmark, so its combination of higher performance and lower power (which was reduced by 46.6W from the 14900K) yields this huge increase in efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4766\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"801a0416-e057-49f0-8d22-00625ff70372\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Finally, Final Fantasy 14 for efficiency. In this one, the 7800X3D led with an impressive 42.5W power draw while spewing hundreds of frames per second, allowing it a result of 8.3 FPS/W. That’s great. The 5700X3D keeps its second-place spot at 7.7. The 14900K ran at 3.1 FPS/W, so the 285K is 32% improved by these numbers. This is one where the 285K was regressive in performance against the 14900K -- and by sort of a lot, but we’ll come back to that. The result is reduced efficiency gains.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

These drops are abnormal on Intel during this test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K with the latest microcode held 6000MHz.

The 2023 launch entry was higher, at 5280-5400MHz on average. The microcode changes may have affected this since launch. The MSI 0x11D microcode entry had the CPU at around 5000MHz from the same window as the ASUS 2023 entry.

This is one of the 2024 titles we added to our suite last time. It’s had updates that affect performance since our last round of benchmarks. APO doesn’t do anything in this benchmark and isn’t supported. We tested with it on and off for both the 14900K and 285K and its performance was the same, so we removed the redundant entries here since they have no impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K landed at about 104 FPS AVG, with lows at 64 FPS and 51 FPS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows the AMD 7800X3D at $480 to lead the $590 285K by 6.1%, with the 14900K at 5% ahead. The lows between these 3 CPUs are functionally identical. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF57FL5\">13700K</a> also lead the 285K here, with the 14700K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-desperate-i7-14700k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>) far cheaper at $350.

The 14900K is also advantaged, this time by 12% with a 385 FPS result. The lows for the 285K were 186 FPS 1%, which is a worse entry than the 14900K’s 250 result. The frametime pacing appears better, in-step with the average, on both the 14900K and 7800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking now at the APO results, toggling APO does appear to do something in this game: The 285K gained 1.3% with APO on. How very exciting -- we can hardly contain ourselves. You’ll surely notice the extra 3-4 frames per second on top of the other 343 before them. We’re so glad we spent half a day troubleshooting Intel’s fumbled pre-launch settings to gain those frames back... Whatever would we have done without the extra 0.0369 ms reduction in frame time?...</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K also gained about the same amount. It’s irrelevant on both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using DDR5-8600 on the 285K with Gear 2 and blasted VDIMM boosted it to 359 FPS AVG, a 4.5% like-for-like lead over the 344 result. This is almost enough to get the 285K tied with the two-generation-old 13700K (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KbNz8966-I\">our review</a>) from 2022, but not quite. It does, however, tie it with the AMD’s 2020 architecture found in the cache-bolstered 5700X3D with its lower power.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>F1 24 - 1440p</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20F1%2024%20_%201440p_High%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4772\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1f5370e9-8511-4b07-96f6-28ca243570d6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>1440p results are mostly uninteresting: The top is truncated heavily by the increase in resolution.

The 14900K’s 310 FPS AVG establishes a 15% lead over the 285K, marking one of the largest declines of Intel’s performance in our gaming suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5800X3D and 5600X3D are also at the top here, showing that Dawntrail just generally really likes cache, at least on these CPUs. The 5700X3D is a little lower down since its frequency is 300MHz below that of the 5600X3D, so these results make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K ends up below the 14700K and 13700K, with APO doing nothing on the 285K. It’s within error. Final Fantasy 14 is officially supported by APO though and is on the games list, and we do see a slight uplift on the 14900K of 1%, basically error. Switching to DDR5-8600 on the 285K provided an uplift of 4%, with it still below the 13700K after that.

Swapping to DDR5-8600 memory boosted the 285K by 7.6%, allowing it to pass everything except the X3D CPUs (this also perfectly aligns with why X3D does so well here). Of course, shoving better memory into the 14900K or 9000-series AMD CPUs would also boost them fairly proportionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stellaris Simulation Time</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellaris is up next. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20v3.13.1%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4776\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9cf4bd54-d9cf-47c5-a7f8-42616a2bc35a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>APO has no impact on this game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K required 32.5 seconds for the simulation, finally putting it ahead of the 14900K.

Enabling APO did nothing on the 285K. The result was within error when considering we’re almost at 600 FPS. Enabling it boosted the 14900K by 1.7%, and this is with Intel’s sh*tty Microsoft Store App confirming that it’s enabled for both CPUs. This boost is reduced for the 14900K versus APO’s launch because Rainbow Six has updated the code that was causing problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going to DDR5-8600 increased performance over the 584 result by 2.6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K is at least better than the 14700K in this one, with an uplift of 2%. It’s also about 1.8% ahead of the 7700 non-X, which has been $280-$290 lately when you can still find it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a general note, this game has some serious 0.1% low consistency issues. We noticed that the 12-14 Series CPUs have significantly higher 0.1% lows than AMD’s options and than the 285K alike. It’s easier to look at a frametime plot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Rainbow Six Siege Frametimes</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Rainbow%20Six%20Siege%20_%201080p_VHigh%20_%20Frametimes%20_%20GamersNexus_all.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4778\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ea86e2a-ad77-4e30-8d3f-b903ca935f4a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here it is. Because Intel noted that Rainbow Six had specifically tuned to reduce reliance on APO, and because of the low advantage of Alder Lake onward, we’re assuming that Rainbow Six Siege has specific and manual tuning for the Alder Lake architecture and its more recent derivatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This frametime plot shows the 14900K is overall highly consistent frame-to-frame, with most of the intervals deviating at most by 2ms. There are a few spikes, but only one notable spike to 6ms -- which is a 4ms deviation, and thus wouldn’t be noticed by the vast majority of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding the 285K, we see several spikes to 10-11ms. By themselves, these frametimes aren’t bad. 60 FPS would be 16.667ms, so this isn’t a huge stall. But it is a big change from Raptor Lake and is objectively worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Starfield</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Starfield%20_%201080p_Low%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4779\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e07fb9d9-b63a-47fd-b4f8-887ef05239d6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Starfield, another 2023 game, the 7800X3D maintains a 2% advantage over the 285K, at 145.4 to 142.5 FPS AVG. We’re bound elsewhere -- and that elsewhere is obvious: The DDR5-8600 result jumps to the top of the chart, illustrating that at least some of our limit is memory. As a reminder, applying the memory tuning treatment to everything would boost all numbers, so looking at baseline will give you an idea for their headroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K actually falls behind for once, at a slight loss to the 285K. We think this corresponds with the cache changes, based on the memory performance we just saw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>APO, once again, does nothing between the two main 285K entries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Total Warhammer 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Total%20War_%20Warhammer%20III%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4780\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cce84d2a-c307-4631-8aee-073c7e61c62a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Total War: Warhammer 3 is up now. The 7800X3D led the 285K by 7.2%, with the 14900K leading by 2.8%. Total Warhammer 3 is on the APO list, so it’s supported. On the 14900K, we saw an uplift of about 1.2%. On the 285K, we measured an improvement of 0.6% -- basically error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lows in this game have been historically awful on Intel’s i9 CPUs, which we previously proved is due to scheduling challenges with the thread count. The 285K at least seems to somewhat improve here, possibly by the reduction in threads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"285k-production-benchmarks\"><strong>Intel Core Ultra 9 285K Production Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re getting into production benchmarks now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Blender</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Blender is up first. We’ve updated it, so it’s not comparable to prior results.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Blender%204.2.2%20%28GN%20Logo%29%20Rendering%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4781\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"bfe4861a-c6c0-4800-aabc-6d882c44279e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 285K is our second-highest performer on the charts for desktop-class CPUs. The 9950X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-9-9950x-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7950x-9700x-14900k-more\">our review</a>) benefits from a render time requirement reduction of 5.6%, while the 285K reduces render time from the 14900K by 16.5%. That’s finally some uplift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These types of tests are also where AMD’s 7800X3D and 5800X3D show their limits as 8-core CPUs, both falling far down the charts. That’s a known quantity. If you’re only gaming, they make the most sense. If you mix in a good amount of heavily threaded software for work, it may make sense to buy something else on this list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4782\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"4f59c927-47ec-4c34-8505-c09d55c82054\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In file compression with 7-Zip, the 285K completed 170K MIPS and roughly tied the i7-14700K. The 14900K holds an advantage of 8%. The 9950X and 7950X (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRaJXZMOMPU\">our review</a>) outperform the 285K significantly, with the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoylISzhB5\">9900X</a> just behind. Memory seemed to really help in this test, pushing the 285K up by a gargantuan 18.7%. That’s a huge uplift. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4783\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f12b9db0-6dc0-49b4-af75-eda10d4c0b88\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Decompression doesn’t benefit as much, posting a 4% improvement. The stack also shuffles, with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-RyzenTM-9900X-24-Thread-Processor/dp/B0D6NN87T8?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9900X</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoyoYfytmS\">7900X</a> both surpassing the 285K here. The memory subsystem benefits don’t translate as much as they did in compression, both stock and with the better RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K leads the 285K by a staggering 21% in this benchmark, benefitting from its extra threads. The 9950X establishes an impressive ceiling, at 42% ahead of the 285K.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Chromium Compile</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Chromium%20Code%20Compile%20%28Windows%29%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4784\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b7f99b78-8321-4426-a845-684ba803f136\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Next is our Chromium code compile test. For this test, we double the RAM capacity on some CPUs when they page-out or otherwise fail to complete the compile. This only occurs with the highest-performing few CPUs. This test has been updated since last round, so load on CPUs has slightly changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the situation of the 9950X, there is one disclaimer here, we were not able to get it stable at DDR5-6000 with 64GB when running our usual tighter timings. We experimented briefly with reducing the timings, higher voltages, and altered infinity fabric, but ultimately had to call it for now and run it at DDR5-5600 to accommodate 64GB. That makes the 9950X an imperfect comparison. With that limitation disclosed due to stability issues, the 9950X and 285K are roughly equal. That may change if we can rerun the 9950X and find stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For direct comparisons, the 285K leads the 14900K by only about a 3-minute time reduction or a total compile time requirement reduction of 3.8%. As usual, the 8-core X3D parts are lower down the stack, like the 7800X3D and 5800X3D. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Adobe Premiere</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Adobe%20Premiere%20%28Puget%20Suite%29%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4785\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9c8cb8e7-b6b3-4a21-9cdf-3c992f7446f4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Now for the Adobe software, tested with the Puget Suite. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Premiere has the 285K as the new chart-topper, at 11,336 points. That’s how this whole review should have been, especially with a power reduction. Unfortunately, it wasn’t this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lead over the 14900K is small, at 2.5% uplift in aggregate. The 9950X is AMD’s top CPU here, at 10,914 points. The 285K has a 3.9% lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Adobe%20Photoshop%20%28Puget%20Suite%29%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4786\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"4748624f-62dd-434c-8636-de6439001b96\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Adobe Photoshop, AMD has a clean sweep of the entire top half of the charts. Those of you who’ve been watching us for at least 5 years will remember an era where it was the opposite.

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-285K/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">285K</a> can hardly make sense against even the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxpgEY9q9\">5700X3D</a>, and AMD’s 9800X3D is days away at this point. For non-gaming, the CPU is more interesting but we still don’t think it is broadly justifiable at the current CPU and platform costs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Intel’s prior-gen parts are far cheaper right now, like the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnowvdojzPu\">13700K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a>, which theoretically have been fixed with microcode. If you were to argue that the inefficiency of the prior gen parts counters some of the savings in the form of lower power, it’s just not a strong argument. The <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnowsX5PkHu\">14700K</a> is $350 now, so it’s $280 cheaper than a 285K. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Power Value - Cheap Power</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/power-cost-10ct-kwh-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4788\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a91180ec-95a5-4f1f-8971-8bbca8668f09\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>If your power costs $0.10/kWh like ours, then you’d need to play the highest CPU load games for 8 hours a day for an entire year in order to gain $19 of value in power bill reductions for the 285K against the 14700K. At $0.15, the shut-in gaming levels would give the 285K a savings of $30 over one year of literally playing Starfield or Cyberpunk as a full-time job. At the peak of degeneracy that we all strive to achieve, you’d have to play games at this pace for 10 years to have spent more on power than the cost savings of buying the cheaper CPU (it’s the delta, not total cost). Maybe throw in a cheaper cooler as well since power is down and call it 8 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Power Value - Moderate Power</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/power-cost-30ct-kwh-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4789\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cb6075d5-696a-49f7-aee5-0e3c40a7a3a1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Even at $0.30/kWh, the $280 price savings from the 14700K would require 5 years to wipe-out with the power bill while playing Cyberpunk 8 hours per day for 5 years, or in other words, 14,560 hours of Cyberpunk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Power Value - Expensive Power</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/power-cost-50ct-kwh-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4790\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b1742a21-f50a-4c2f-970d-c85021bf9f84\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Let’s just say you pay $0.50/kWh. In one standard 3-year upgrade cycle, you can save the amount of money in power you’d save buying the 14700K -- which we still don’t recommend for gaming -- rather than the 285K. That’d be a savings of $92.60 per year (at $307.7 - $215.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, you go with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a> and get higher framerates and still a power cost reduction, even at these high electricity prices, of $114 per year at these crazy gaming hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And ultimately, no matter what argument is made for power savings, like room temperature or something, you can still point to AMD as an answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reduction in power consumption is important and does mean cheaper cooling is possible, so that’s good. Intel is objectively getting more efficient, but regressive performance in games is hard to deal with. The production performance mostly improved at lower thread count, and that actually is great. The problem is that at $630, there are very few cases where the 285K makes sense right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our approach to reviews is very consumer-oriented and value-oriented. That means for us, we need to see a strong value argument to recommend a part. Even forgetting completely about power as a factor and looking only at performance for the price, it just doesn’t make sense to us despite being an important building block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best news out of the 285K is that it might be a fresh start for Intel and that it is genuinely a lot easier to hit higher memory clocks than before, and that benefits it in tests like our 7-Zip benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we just think there are better CPUs out there at lower prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

These will not work in LGA 1700 motherboards, and LGA 1700 CPUs will not work in LGA 1851 motherboards. There are also multiple independent loading mechanism options chosen by motherboard manufacturers -- we’ll have a separate video shortly with laser scans and pressure maps of those. More specs can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhIXt1svQZg\">Arrow Lake announcement coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"not-ready-for-launch\"><strong>Not Ready for Launch</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First off: Arrow Lake really doesn’t seem ready for launch. Intel told us this about Arrow Lake in a briefing:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The big change is that every ODM now, without fail, every ODM ships with this [APO] enabled. In the BIOS, the Camarillo device is turned on, there’ll be a yellow bang, the driver will install, and APO will be enabled by default. That’s the out-of-box-experience everybody is going to have. You’d want to mimic what folks are going to see.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is going to be something that is going to be probably just as important as the hardware improvements. [...] All your ODMs, the board vendors, it’s all enabled by default and should auto-install, 13th Gen onward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is important because we don’t test with APO so we had to consider it for this review. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel presented first-party benchmark slides with APO enabled and emphasized with us that not only would it be on by default with Z890, but that it would also be on by default with Z790. Neither was true. We discovered this issue and brought it to Intel only because we weren’t sure if it was our fault, and it wasn’t. The company seemed totally unaware of this failing and, after some back-and-forth, eventually realized it had simply screwed up. As a result of our findings, Intel is moving to publish a list of motherboards that support APO out of the box on by default in BIOS going forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that’s great for consumers so that it clears up the misleading nature of the original claims, this product is clearly not ready if we’re the ones beta testing such strong statements as “without fail” for a feature that wasn’t present, as pointless as it often is. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h16m57s024.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4747\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"97b2a140-c476-4665-bc4f-0b1a10a516ad\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Dynamic Tuning also no longer exists on our board, despite Intel telling us that it should be present and enabled. The option has been renamed to Innovation Platform Framework and was off by default, which meant APO was off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the latest microcode and BIOS on Z790 for these reviews, we also found that APO was off by default for those platforms as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We consider APO off the default user experience for the product as Intel shipped it to us; however, we tested with both. APO was ultimately irrelevant in our test suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was one of many unforced errors from Intel, with others including BSODs on Windows install due to a driver conflict with NVIDIA devices when the IGP is enabled. This issue did not exist on prior architectures and seems to be a combination of the new IGP claiming the PCIE resources and of NVIDIA’s driver code not having an error handler for 0 PCIE resource availability. You can bypass it by disabling the IGP, but for a lot of people, this will be frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform also has some issues with Easy Anti-Cheat, which Intel will soon be publishing a statement about, but we’ll leave that to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Level1Techs\">Wendell’s coverage</a>, but basically, if you disable security features, you’re able to work around the issue. We just wouldn’t recommend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h17m15s872.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4748\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2b3068eb-62af-40a7-b876-13ca24f3c404\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Additionally, Intel sent a statement about power profiles where balanced power on 24H2 results in uncharacteristically bad performance. We test with high performance except where we’re specifically required to use balance in some X3D situations so this didn’t affect us but does represent one of Intel’s launch problems. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h17m18s193.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4749\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b37b33c7-5b8a-408b-b60d-3fc42aa1eb4d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Intel even got its own specs wrong on the slide above where it said the chipset can support up to 32 USB 3.2 devices but actually it’s supposed to be 10.

The 24-pin has several voltages, including 3.3V, 5V, 5VSB, and 12V shown here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATX12V rail includes things like fans, the CPU, and if we hadn’t isolated it, slot power, among other miscellaneous controllers on motherboards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slot power is around 30-35W, which is why it’s important to isolate it if capturing 24-pin power. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Slot Power Problems</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/slot-power-spike_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4753\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"971cd470-5153-42f2-bf44-bc38353a2d63\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s why we isolate slot power: This benchmark was for 7-Zip on the 14900K. The GPU does literally nothing in this test except spit out the display. It does not engage in the test. However, occasionally in any test, we measure seemingly random spikes to slot power. This could be for a number of unpredictable reasons, including innocuous ones like Windows background tasks or NVIDIA’s drivers doing something in the background, such as telemetry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin & EPS12V Power: 14900K vs. 285K</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the comparison we’ve wanted:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Power%20Consumption%20Distribution%20_%20i9-14900K%20vs.%20285K%20in%207-Zip%20_%20GamersNexus_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4754\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a8fac24c-a56f-43d6-a953-404d3251c3c6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In 7-Zip, ignoring EPS12V, we noticed that the ATX12V power was exceptionally high on the 285K and Z890 Hero combination compared to the 14900K and Z790 Hero. It’s at about 50W here, whereas the 14900K had ATX12V down around 30W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ATX3V power is comparable on both and within 2W. ATX5V power isn’t easy to call a simple average since it fluctuates so much: The range is 14-30W on the 285K+ASUS combination and similar on the 14900K, with peaks about 3-5W lower than the 285K. We don’t know if any of that power is getting used for regulators that might feed the CPU, but if any of it is, it’s not much. A lot of it is driving other components, like I/O.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATX12V line is clearly important though, as not factoring-in that 20-30W difference in this test would mean representing the 285K as artificially efficient because the power is sort of “hidden” in a cable where it’s not typically meaningfully high. ASUS’ reasoning for this is theoretically better power regulation. We don’t know if anyone else is doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin Power: 7800X3D vs. 285K ATX12V</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as an example of AMD, here’s the 7800X3D and 285K.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/7800x3d-vs-285k-atx12v_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4755\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5520a4a3-63ec-4d7e-98a7-bd5d64105221\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 285K and 14900K ATX12V remains from last time. The 7800X3D was pulling about 12W ATX12V fixed during this test and didn’t seem to fluctuate based on load at all. It appears fairly isolated. Typically, this gap of 10W comes out in the wash when you’re talking a 280W 14900K versus an 80W 7800X3D, so it’s just part of the usual margins. In this scenario, however, the difference against the 285K really starts to show.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin Power: 7800X3D vs. 285K ATX3V</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/285k-vs-7800x3d_3v_all-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4756\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c907f4db-f225-49c4-b3e9-03539b510557\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s ATX3V. The 7800X3D platform is marginally higher here -- we’re using an ASUS board for this also. This is part of why 5V normally comes out in the wash: Some rails are a few Watts higher, some a few Watts lower. There is always going to be error.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>24-Pin Power: 7800X3D vs. 285K ATX5V</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Power%20Consumption%20Distribution%20_%20i9-14900K%20vs.%20285K%20vs.%207800X3D%20ATX5V%20in%207-Zip%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4757\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2afae4be-0a65-4b77-a59b-7fbcd9b73241\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>ATX5V is about the same between them all. There is possibly spikier behavior on the 285K from the I/O, but that’s about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Software Readings</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All this is done with hardware. We also can’t trust various software readings because they can be manipulated heavily by software or motherboards. Years ago, there was an issue where AMD motherboards were underreporting the power in a way that allowed boards to pull more or less power while hiding it in software, thus manipulating the report. We also spoke with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kzGTOyCYrY\">Der8auer</a> about his experiences, and he noticed that CPU Package Power is calculated based on VID, so if anything is wrong with voltage, it will manifest in erroneous software readings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m00s441.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4758\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m00s441.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m00s441.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4758\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aaad0565-d430-48c1-9389-9fa53622803d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m02s787.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4759\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m02s787.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m02s787.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4759\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"191fa2ba-c0aa-4e50-a588-b69808aec488\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m04s448.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4760\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m04s448.jpg\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-28-15h18m04s448.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-4760\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"5563e146-92d2-4433-ba83-64fb215a83ef\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>And that leads us back to our monster we’ve built. We are fairly confident in the results, but we have to caveat that this is a very opaque platform currently and it’s not fully clear how all the power is routed. For the most part, it should be proportional to the VRM split of 18:4 of the 22 phases total, so we were able to use that as a guidepost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally: You might be asking “who measures the measurers,” and the answer is... us. Working with Elmor, we hooked up other current monitoring devices in series to monitor the current monitoring devices, and we also clamped the cables to monitor the monitoring of the monitoring devices while monitoring the software of the monitoring-monitoring devices and the CPU-monitoring software monitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that was all done and we had tested against calibrated Fluke meters with known current loads, we proceeded with the most accurate combination of monitoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get into the efficiency testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Decompression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Decompression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4761\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8d7e09e4-5d0e-402c-86af-87ae89bdd27a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>7-Zip decompression efficiency is measured in MIPS/W, or millions of instructions per joule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this test, the 285K ended up in the lower-third of the chart. Intel’s 14900K pulled 273W in this test, with the 285K now at 162W for ATX12V and EPS12V without slot power, or 175W with ATX12V, ATX5V, and EPS12V. We think the 162W number is more accurate, but want to transparently present both since the power split is still not fully clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because performance is lower and the formula relies on both, the efficiency increase isn’t as impressive as the power drop. The 285K runs with an efficiency of 1101 MIPS/W decompression with the reading that includes 5V, or an improvement of 29% over the 14900K. The reading without 5V is 40% improved over the 14900K, which we think is the more accurate one. Whether 30% or 40% is closer, the point is that it’s a big uplift. AMD still dominates here, holding the entire top-third of the chart, though. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7950X-32-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBHD5D8Y?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7950X</a> in ECO mode sets a seemingly untouchable score at 1936 MIPS/W. The 7800X3D, which is much slower than the 285K in 7-Zip decompression, is more efficient thanks to its 70W power draw.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: 7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20%28MIPS_W%20or%20Millions%20of%20Instructions%20per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4762\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"511479cc-713c-42bc-9456-9df68d6c542e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s the 7-Zip compression result. Power consumption is measured across compression and decompression in the same test suite, so those figures are unchanged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K scored 1051 MIPS/W with ATX12V and EPS12V, an improvement over the 14900K’s 672 MIPS/W of 56%. This uplift versus decompression comes from the higher performance in 7-Zip compression relative to its scaling in decompression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMD’s 7800X3D is at the top here. Again, it’s not the best performer, but its 70W power is impressive and allows it to remain the true most-efficient CPU we’ve tested lately. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Baldur’s Gate 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Baldur%27s%20Gate%203%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4763\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e3b852dc-7efa-43e8-910f-6f96153f1c51\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Baldur’s Gate 3 could get more complicated, but we’ve isolated out the PCIe slot power by using an interposer to power the video card instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire X3D lineup continues its domination in this game, and most others. The high framerate and low power land the 7800X3D at 2.3 FPS/W, as it’s pulling only 55W during this gaming workload. The <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxpgEY9q9\">5700X3D</a> is about the same, with the 5800X3D (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBFNoKUHjcg\">our review</a>) slightly less efficient. Intel’s new 285K isn’t remotely close to these numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K with ATX12V and EPS12V ran at 1.1 FPS/W, so the 7800X3D is creating over 2x as many frames per Watt of power. The 14900K ran at 0.7 FPS/W here. Looking at just Intel, the 1.1 result of the 285K has at least improved substantially over the 14900K, with an uplift of 57%; if we include the 5V power, since we’re not certain if any of it is being used for the CPU, that would be a 29% uplift. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Starfield</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Starfield%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4764\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"ff2e4287-7f96-4510-bab1-522e69c8a7ae\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Starfield is a heavier workload from gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one, the 7800X3D is again the most efficient. Its result was 2.1 FPS/W, holding a large lead over the next closest CPUs. The next closest CPU is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5700X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0CQ4H4H7X?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">5700X3D</a>, also at about 70W. The 5800X3D, <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxwYe9ib6\">9700X</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxy11FLO7\">7700</a> non-X follow this. We eventually hit the 3700X (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-r7-3700x-r5-3600-2024-revisit-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-5700x3d-more\">our revisit</a>), then the 285K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the ATX12V and EPS12V measurements and without PCIe slot, we end up at about 147W for a 1.0 FPS/W rating with the usual rounding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K ran at 0.7 FPS/W here, so Intel has improved by 43%. Its Ultra 9 is now about where the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxC8PRq3u\">14600K</a> was previously. Measuring 5V as well had it at 172W, or 0.8 FPS/W. That would instead be an improvement of 14%. As before, we believe the 1.0 figure is closer to reality, but it likely falls in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Stellaris</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20%28Simulations%20Per%20Watt-Hour%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4765\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1b3456db-17d4-4faf-b166-c4eded56b396\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The next game is Stellaris, where we measured simulation time in seconds and power. In order to make this as easy to follow as possible, we’ve done some simple arithmetic to convert this into “simulations per watt-hour,” meaning that a bigger number is better despite the base metric result being lower-is-better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D has an impressive score here, at 2.7 simulations per watt-hour. The next closest is down at 2.4 with the 5700X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/new-amd-ryzen-7-5700x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-5800x3d-more\">our review</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K ran 1.5 simulations per Watt-hour. That means for each watt-hour, the 7800X3D is able to complete 1.2 more simulations, or about an 80% increase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K completed 0.9 simulations per Watt-hour. That means the 285K’s best entry is an improvement of 67% in efficiency. Remember: Most of Intel’s presented numbers were only for power reductions, not necessarily for efficiency. The 285K’s simulation performance is better than the 14900K’s in this benchmark, so its combination of higher performance and lower power (which was reduced by 46.6W from the 14900K) yields this huge increase in efficiency. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Efficiency: Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20%28FPS_W%20or%20Frames%20Per%20Joule%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4766\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"801a0416-e057-49f0-8d22-00625ff70372\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Finally, Final Fantasy 14 for efficiency. In this one, the 7800X3D led with an impressive 42.5W power draw while spewing hundreds of frames per second, allowing it a result of 8.3 FPS/W. That’s great. The 5700X3D keeps its second-place spot at 7.7. The 14900K ran at 3.1 FPS/W, so the 285K is 32% improved by these numbers. This is one where the 285K was regressive in performance against the 14900K -- and by sort of a lot, but we’ll come back to that. The result is reduced efficiency gains.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

The most up-to-date frequency entry sits between the two flanks of early 14900K tests. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>All-Core Frequency Comparison</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/intel-285k-all-core-avg_all.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4769\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e55412c3-d52e-4be5-b409-5e6e5b226427\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Finally, this chart shows the all-core averages in the same test. The 285K averaged 4867MHz when factoring-in the E-cores, with the modern 14900K just below 4500MHz and flanked by the two older entries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"285k-gaming-benchmarks\"><strong>Intel Core Ultra 9 285K Gaming Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we’re going to get into gaming benchmarks.

This is one of the 2024 titles we added to our suite last time. It’s had updates that affect performance since our last round of benchmarks. APO doesn’t do anything in this benchmark and isn’t supported. We tested with it on and off for both the 14900K and 285K and its performance was the same, so we removed the redundant entries here since they have no impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K landed at about 104 FPS AVG, with lows at 64 FPS and 51 FPS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows the AMD 7800X3D at $480 to lead the $590 285K by 6.1%, with the 14900K at 5% ahead. The lows between these 3 CPUs are functionally identical. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF57FL5\">13700K</a> also lead the 285K here, with the 14700K (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-desperate-i7-14700k-cpu-review-benchmarks-gaming-power\">our review</a>) far cheaper at $350. The 5700X3D and 5600X3D (read <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-5600x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-last-chance-upgrade\">our review</a>) are effectively tied, with the 5700X3D at $230, or sometimes down closer to $200.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>F1 24 - 1080p</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20F1%2024%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4771\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"be64e875-c330-4675-889a-7ea2b51ef64a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In F1 24, which, for hopefully obvious reasons, is a 2024 title, we end up with this set of results when fully retested in 24H2 and with new microcode and AGESA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D sets a high ceiling and establishes a 28% lead over the more expensive and higher power-consuming 285K, at 438 FPS to 344 FPS AVG. The 14900K is also advantaged, this time by 12% with a 385 FPS result. The lows for the 285K were 186 FPS 1%, which is a worse entry than the 14900K’s 250 result. The frametime pacing appears better, in-step with the average, on both the 14900K and 7800X3D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking now at the APO results, toggling APO does appear to do something in this game: The 285K gained 1.3% with APO on. How very exciting -- we can hardly contain ourselves. You’ll surely notice the extra 3-4 frames per second on top of the other 343 before them. We’re so glad we spent half a day troubleshooting Intel’s fumbled pre-launch settings to gain those frames back... Whatever would we have done without the extra 0.0369 ms reduction in frame time?...</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K also gained about the same amount. It’s irrelevant on both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using DDR5-8600 on the 285K with Gear 2 and blasted VDIMM boosted it to 359 FPS AVG, a 4.5% like-for-like lead over the 344 result. This is almost enough to get the 285K tied with the two-generation-old 13700K (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KbNz8966-I\">our review</a>) from 2022, but not quite. It does, however, tie it with the AMD’s 2020 architecture found in the cache-bolstered 5700X3D with its lower power.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>F1 24 - 1440p</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20F1%2024%20_%201440p_High%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4772\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1f5370e9-8511-4b07-96f6-28ca243570d6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>1440p results are mostly uninteresting: The top is truncated heavily by the increase in resolution.

This is another 2024 addition to our testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D again establishes the ceiling. It leads the 285K by 31% in this game, at 353 FPS to 270 FPS AVG. The 14900K’s 310 FPS AVG establishes a 15% lead over the 285K, marking one of the largest declines of Intel’s performance in our gaming suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5800X3D and 5600X3D are also at the top here, showing that Dawntrail just generally really likes cache, at least on these CPUs. The 5700X3D is a little lower down since its frequency is 300MHz below that of the 5600X3D, so these results make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K ends up below the 14700K and 13700K, with APO doing nothing on the 285K. It’s within error. Final Fantasy 14 is officially supported by APO though and is on the games list, and we do see a slight uplift on the 14900K of 1%, basically error. Switching to DDR5-8600 on the 285K provided an uplift of 4%, with it still below the 13700K after that. Of course, the same memory treatment would lift others up also.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>FFXIV Dawntrail - 1440p</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20FFXIV_%20Dawntrail%20Benchmark%20v1.1%20_%201440p_Maximum%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4774\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aa7dd053-149a-43e2-ba57-8674837c8e9c\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>At 1440p, the limited ceiling is shuffling the stack as a result of the framerate bouncing off of other limits. We saw a 1.9% uplift from APO on the 14900K.

We test in Act III in a densely populated city area for a heavy CPU load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D establishes a 26% lead over the 285K, at 126 FPS to 100 FPS AVG. The 14900K leads the 285K by 4.5%, at about 105 FPS AVG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5800X3D, 5700X3D, and 5600X3D also lead the 285K, as do the 13900K, 13700K and 14700K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toggling APO did nothing here and was within variance for both the 14900K and 285K. Swapping to DDR5-8600 memory boosted the 285K by 7.6%, allowing it to pass everything except the X3D CPUs (this also perfectly aligns with why X3D does so well here). Of course, shoving better memory into the 14900K or 9000-series AMD CPUs would also boost them fairly proportionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stellaris Simulation Time</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellaris is up next. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Stellaris%20v3.13.1%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4776\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9cf4bd54-d9cf-47c5-a7f8-42616a2bc35a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>APO has no impact on this game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K required 32.5 seconds for the simulation, finally putting it ahead of the 14900K. The 285K requires about 1-2% less time than the 14700K and 14900K CPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7800X3D outranks the 285K again and requires about 3.7% less time for the work. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9700X-16-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0D6NMDNNX?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">9700X</a> remains the fastest here, which is consistent with our last round of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boosting memory helps in this game, so the 285K benefited from a 4.3% reduction in time to complete the simulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Rainbow%20Six%20Siege%20_%201080p_VHigh%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4777\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d0d107fd-ff12-4533-bfa2-dcd55b963a1e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Rainbow Six Siege is up. In this one, the 7800X3D leads by a much smaller amount, at only 6.6% for 622 vs. 584 FPS AVG when APO is in its default off position that this board shipped in. The 14900K was tied. Enabling APO did nothing on the 285K. The result was within error when considering we’re almost at 600 FPS. Enabling it boosted the 14900K by 1.7%, and this is with Intel’s sh*tty Microsoft Store App confirming that it’s enabled for both CPUs. This boost is reduced for the 14900K versus APO’s launch because Rainbow Six has updated the code that was causing problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going to DDR5-8600 increased performance over the 584 result by 2.6%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 285K is at least better than the 14700K in this one, with an uplift of 2%. It’s also about 1.8% ahead of the 7700 non-X, which has been $280-$290 lately when you can still find it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a general note, this game has some serious 0.1% low consistency issues. We noticed that the 12-14 Series CPUs have significantly higher 0.1% lows than AMD’s options and than the 285K alike. It’s easier to look at a frametime plot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Rainbow Six Siege Frametimes</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Rainbow%20Six%20Siege%20_%201080p_VHigh%20_%20Frametimes%20_%20GamersNexus_all.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4778\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3ea86e2a-ad77-4e30-8d3f-b903ca935f4a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here it is. Because Intel noted that Rainbow Six had specifically tuned to reduce reliance on APO, and because of the low advantage of Alder Lake onward, we’re assuming that Rainbow Six Siege has specific and manual tuning for the Alder Lake architecture and its more recent derivatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This frametime plot shows the 14900K is overall highly consistent frame-to-frame, with most of the intervals deviating at most by 2ms. There are a few spikes, but only one notable spike to 6ms -- which is a 4ms deviation, and thus wouldn’t be noticed by the vast majority of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding the 285K, we see several spikes to 10-11ms. By themselves, these frametimes aren’t bad. 60 FPS would be 16.667ms, so this isn’t a huge stall. But it is a big change from Raptor Lake and is objectively worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Starfield</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Starfield%20_%201080p_Low%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4779\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e07fb9d9-b63a-47fd-b4f8-887ef05239d6\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In Starfield, another 2023 game, the 7800X3D maintains a 2% advantage over the 285K, at 145.4 to 142.5 FPS AVG. We’re bound elsewhere -- and that elsewhere is obvious: The DDR5-8600 result jumps to the top of the chart, illustrating that at least some of our limit is memory. As a reminder, applying the memory tuning treatment to everything would boost all numbers, so looking at baseline will give you an idea for their headroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14900K actually falls behind for once, at a slight loss to the 285K. We think this corresponds with the cache changes, based on the memory performance we just saw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>APO, once again, does nothing between the two main 285K entries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Total Warhammer 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Total%20War_%20Warhammer%20III%20_%201080p_Medium%20_%20GamersNexus.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4780\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cce84d2a-c307-4631-8aee-073c7e61c62a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Total War: Warhammer 3 is up now.

On the 285K, we measured an improvement of 0.6% -- basically error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lows in this game have been historically awful on Intel’s i9 CPUs, which we previously proved is due to scheduling challenges with the thread count. The 285K at least seems to somewhat improve here, possibly by the reduction in threads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"285k-production-benchmarks\"><strong>Intel Core Ultra 9 285K Production Benchmarks</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re getting into production benchmarks now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Blender</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Blender is up first.

That’s finally some uplift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These types of tests are also where AMD’s 7800X3D and 5800X3D show their limits as 8-core CPUs, both falling far down the charts. That’s a known quantity. If you’re only gaming, they make the most sense. If you mix in a good amount of heavily threaded software for work, it may make sense to buy something else on this list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>7-Zip Compression</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%207-Zip%20Compression%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4782\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"4f59c927-47ec-4c34-8505-c09d55c82054\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>In file compression with 7-Zip, the 285K completed 170K MIPS and roughly tied the i7-14700K. The 14900K holds an advantage of 8%. The 9950X and 7950X (watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRaJXZMOMPU\">our review</a>) outperform the 285K significantly, with the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoylISzhB5\">9900X</a> just behind. Memory seemed to really help in this test, pushing the 285K up by a gargantuan 18.7%.

For this test, we double the RAM capacity on some CPUs when they page-out or otherwise fail to complete the compile. This only occurs with the highest-performing few CPUs. This test has been updated since last round, so load on CPUs has slightly changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the situation of the 9950X, there is one disclaimer here, we were not able to get it stable at DDR5-6000 with 64GB when running our usual tighter timings. We experimented briefly with reducing the timings, higher voltages, and altered infinity fabric, but ultimately had to call it for now and run it at DDR5-5600 to accommodate 64GB. That makes the 9950X an imperfect comparison. With that limitation disclosed due to stability issues, the 9950X and 285K are roughly equal. That may change if we can rerun the 9950X and find stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For direct comparisons, the 285K leads the 14900K by only about a 3-minute time reduction or a total compile time requirement reduction of 3.8%. As usual, the 8-core X3D parts are lower down the stack, like the 7800X3D and 5800X3D. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Adobe Premiere</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Adobe%20Premiere%20%28Puget%20Suite%29%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4785\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9c8cb8e7-b6b3-4a21-9cdf-3c992f7446f4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Now for the Adobe software, tested with the Puget Suite. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Premiere has the 285K as the new chart-topper, at 11,336 points.

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-Ultra-Processor-285K/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">285K</a> can hardly make sense against even the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnoxpgEY9q9\">5700X3D</a>, and AMD’s 9800X3D is days away at this point. For non-gaming, the CPU is more interesting but we still don’t think it is broadly justifiable at the current CPU and platform costs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Intel’s prior-gen parts are far cheaper right now, like the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnowvdojzPu\">13700K</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/i7-14700K-Desktop-Processor-Integrated-Graphics/dp/B0CGJ41C9W?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">14700K</a>, which theoretically have been fixed with microcode. If you were to argue that the inefficiency of the prior gen parts counters some of the savings in the form of lower power, it’s just not a strong argument. The <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnowsX5PkHu\">14700K</a> is $350 now, so it’s $280 cheaper than a 285K. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Power Value - Cheap Power</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/power-cost-10ct-kwh-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4788\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a91180ec-95a5-4f1f-8971-8bbca8668f09\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>If your power costs $0.10/kWh like ours, then you’d need to play the highest CPU load games for 8 hours a day for an entire year in order to gain $19 of value in power bill reductions for the 285K against the 14700K. At $0.15, the shut-in gaming levels would give the 285K a savings of $30 over one year of literally playing Starfield or Cyberpunk as a full-time job. At the peak of degeneracy that we all strive to achieve, you’d have to play games at this pace for 10 years to have spent more on power than the cost savings of buying the cheaper CPU (it’s the delta, not total cost). Maybe throw in a cheaper cooler as well since power is down and call it 8 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Power Value - Moderate Power</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/power-cost-30ct-kwh-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4789\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cb6075d5-696a-49f7-aee5-0e3c40a7a3a1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Even at $0.30/kWh, the $280 price savings from the 14700K would require 5 years to wipe-out with the power bill while playing Cyberpunk 8 hours per day for 5 years, or in other words, 14,560 hours of Cyberpunk.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Power Value - Expensive Power</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/power-cost-50ct-kwh-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4790\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b1742a21-f50a-4c2f-970d-c85021bf9f84\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Let’s just say you pay $0.50/kWh. In one standard 3-year upgrade cycle, you can save the amount of money in power you’d save buying the 14700K -- which we still don’t recommend for gaming -- rather than the 285K. That’d be a savings of $92.60 per year (at $307.7 - $215.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, you go with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-7800X3D-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B0BTZB7F88?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">7800X3D</a> and get higher framerates and still a power cost reduction, even at these high electricity prices, of $114 per year at these crazy gaming hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And ultimately, no matter what argument is made for power savings, like room temperature or something, you can still point to AMD as an answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reduction in power consumption is important and does mean cheaper cooling is possible, so that’s good. Intel is objectively getting more efficient, but regressive performance in games is hard to deal with. The production performance mostly improved at lower thread count, and that actually is great. The problem is that at $630, there are very few cases where the 285K makes sense right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our approach to reviews is very consumer-oriented and value-oriented. That means for us, we need to see a strong value argument to recommend a part. Even forgetting completely about power as a factor and looking only at performance for the price, it just doesn’t make sense to us despite being an important building block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best news out of the 285K is that it might be a fresh start for Intel and that it is genuinely a lot easier to hit higher memory clocks than before, and that benefits it in tests like our 7-Zip benchmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we just think there are better CPUs out there at lower prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The case shoves the power supply to the front to accommodate 2 shroud-top fans that are closer to the floor of the case, providing intake directly into the GPU. The front of the case has a shaped front inlet for 2x 140mm fans cooling the rest, and the back is entirely ventilation to allow exhaust. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a usability perspective, it struggles in some key and basic areas: Cable management is challenging. Closing the right side panel isn’t always easy, especially if you have more cables, thicker gauge wire and sleeving, or accessories that add a ton of cabling. The side panel is tool-less and the back compartment is shallow, with the PSU’s orientation complicating power supply length and cable bends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on October 4, 2024 as a video.

We've spotted a few changes to the case since that Computex showing: the weird removable plate at the bottom of the front panel is gone, the bottom intake fans are conventional rather than reverse-blade, and the side panel vent is smaller. None of these changes are meaningful from a consumer perspective. The removable plate never had an assigned function other than to possibly be “DLC” add-ons, the bottom intake fans look basically the same, and the functional area of the side vent hasn't changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lancool-207-specs\"><strong>Lian Li Lancool 207 Specs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Dimensions (DxWxH)</td><td>455.6mm x 219mm x 456mm</td></tr><tr><td>Color</td><td>Black / White</td></tr><tr><td>Motherboard Support</td><td>ATX (Width = 240mm) / Micro-ATX / Mini-ITX</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion Slot</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>2 x 3.5” HDD or 2.5″ SSD</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Length Clearance</td><td>410 mm</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Cooler Height Clearance</td><td>167 mm</td></tr><tr><td>PSU Support</td><td>ATX (Under 160mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Radiator Support</td><td>Top: 240mm / 280mm/ 360mm</td></tr><tr><td>Fan Support</td><td>Front: 140mm x 2 (pre-installed)Top: 120mm x 3 or 140mm x 2Bottom: 120mm x 2 (pre-installed)Rear: 120mm x 1</td></tr><tr><td>Dust Filter</td><td>Bottom x 1</td></tr><tr><td>I/O Ports</td><td>USB 3.0 x 2USB 3.1 Type C x 1Audio x 1Power Button x 1</td></tr><tr><td>MSRP</td><td>Black - US$79.99White - US$84.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><em>Specs copied from manufacturer materials, please read review for our own measurements and opinions</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We like the Lancool 207, and we have a lot of good things to say about it, but we consider the power supply situation to be plagued with oversights.

Rather than elevating the floor and pulling through that, Lian Li pulls through the rear and sides. This allows the floor to be available for hard drives and SSDs. Even with a 3.5” drive installed, there’s still plenty of room between it and the sunken fans to pull air through.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-14h06m57s523.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4701\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b4816b54-6f77-46be-8dc7-6b8270f5c416\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The panels are also exceptionally sturdy for a case of its price. The top panel snaps into place with heavy-duty studs and uses folded-over columns of steel to reinforce it.

We'll begrudgingly accept this as a compromise since it cuts the number of fan cables in half. The downside is that it's impractical to replace or reconfigure individual fans, contributing to a larger downside of having to go through Lian Li for replacements if one breaks. The front and bottom mounts aren't compatible with any sizes other than the ones that are preinstalled (140mm front, 120mm bottom). On top of that, the front mount is built around Lian Li's 30mm-thick fans, and all four stock fans are attached with radiator screws. If you still want to replace any, Lian Li includes 16 additional screws sized for 25mm-thick fans. All of this is non-standard and will be unfamiliar to experienced builders. It’s workable, but it will impose atypical limitations on fan compatibility if you want to change them. For instance, you’d typically have 120mm options where 140mm fans install. Here, that’s not the case. The upside is that there’s one less set of rails obstructing intake at the cost of flexibility, so Lian Li is going for the focused airflow approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h43m46s905.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4718\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c2cdc149-001d-4ec8-86ec-00179717793c\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Lian Li describes the 207 as a \"compact M-ATX-sized case with ATX compatibility,\" which is only true by Lian Li standards.

This means that there's a 160mm size limit for PSUs, but even our normal 150mm unit was cramped. Without dropping out of the ATX spec, 150mm is about the smallest you’ll typically get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the rotation, cables are pointed at the tool-less side panel and have to bend sharply to route. Using flat cables helps, but this is a situation where you’ll need to consider how the cables in your power supply are sleeved. We’d also strongly recommend sticking to 150mm rather than using the maximum 160mm under the spec. We’d also strongly recommend modular power supplies for this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PSU shroud is effectively a fan mount, and even if you could find a way to stick extra cables under it, it'd interfere with the intake fans and the entire point of the design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this would only be an inconvenience, except that the steel side panel is tooless. If you're using bulkier cables with individually braided sleeves like in our example, it is possible to choose power supply and cable combinations that make it nearly impossible to snugly close the side panel. It’s possible, and we did it with our bulky sleeved cables to prove that, but this took a good amount of time to manage and flatten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d strongly recommend flat cables like the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pARWmgnfcVU?t=248\">ones shown in the 207 at Computex</a>. The more accessories and PCIe power cables you run, the more difficulty you’ll have managing the cables in this particular case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screws for the side panel would have helped this by allowing more tolerance for cable bulge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manual illustrates installing a Lian Li <a href=\"https://lian-li.com/product/edge/\">EDGE PSU</a>, which looks like it could help; however, the 207 is $80, and the cheapest EDGE PSUs cost at least $130 to $140. It’s a mismatch of the most likely buyer for the case if Lian Li expects most to use these power supplies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The illustration also shows the EDGE PSU being installed fan-side-up, which isn't an officially supported option for other power supplies. The usual arrangement of mounting holes requires installing standard ATX PSUs fan-down in the 207, with only 1cm of clearance above the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another major concern, in Lian Li’s quest to move the power supply, it has overlooked both cabling and cooling considerations. With the bottom filter installed, which we’ll come back to, the power supply is given mere millimeters to breathe with a bottom-oriented fan. We don’t currently run power supply thermals during our testing; however, this will cause the power supply to heat up, objectively, and it may result in the PSU fan running at a higher RPM (if it is a power supply that bases fan speed on any internal temperatures).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing the filter functionally doubles its breathing room, but ultimately, we think this is a major design shortcoming. Lian Li’s pursuit of minimizing the case size has limited its area for power supply intake. This is making us consider running a thermocouple wire to our power supply for future case reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m40s245.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4724\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m40s245.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m40s245.png\" class=\"wp-image-4724\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"63fb8062-f0fc-4351-800c-97835fd12458\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m42s638.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4725\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m42s638.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m42s638.png\" class=\"wp-image-4725\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"50b7391f-954d-4d82-95dc-9a085f611a1d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The PSU filter is another small design fault: It’s easiest to lift the case to remove the filter, which isn’t a dealbreaker, but could be fixed with a more accessible tab. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m11s347.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4726\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m11s347.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m11s347.png\" class=\"wp-image-4726\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"bb7e4afb-5083-4511-a11a-286e22eee617\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m15s894.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4727\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m15s894.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m15s894.png\" class=\"wp-image-4727\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f5cac224-2462-4af4-b234-724c62c640a3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>On the cable management side on the back of the case, the attachment points for the built-in velcro straps are angled so that the straps curl over as they're inserted, which is a much bigger quality of life improvement than it sounds like.

Check <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_w0NbB84P0\">our Lancool 216 review</a> for more detail on alternate configurations, including an external fan bracket attached to the back of the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Full Load Thermals - Noise-Normalized</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%2027dBA%20Noise%20Normalized%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4731\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"517b7d6c-4aa6-47f6-9d39-9c8c5c4c3af1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 207 is a loud case with all fans at full speed, but we'll start with noise normalized results. For this testing, all case fans are lowered to reach a target noise level of 27 dBA measured at 1 meter in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUqYTenB2A0\">hemi-anechoic chamber</a>, with CPU and GPU fan speeds controlled and constant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll start with noise-normalized GPU thermals since those bottom fans should help there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GPU temperature averaged 42 degrees above ambient, 47 on the memory, and 55 hotspot. That's one degree better than the 216 in each category, but still close. Impressively, the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhkjYsuB5b\">Fractal Torrent</a> remains the leader in this particular test. That’s not always true, but it is here. It has its own bottom intake fans that feed the GPU directly, which help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven't always seen a benefit from shroud-top intake fans, but cases like the 207 and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-High-Airflow-Motherboard-Simultaneously-Mid-Tower/dp/B0D9LLWBCB?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Flux Pro</a> that commit to building the case around that concept do show good results. If anything, it's a testament to the 216's cooling that it comes so close to the 207 without any shroud fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhkqyWAwH8\">Antec Flux Pro</a>'s average GPU temperature was about one degree cooler than the 207's.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There's no contest versus the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-All-Metal-Radiator-SST-FA514X-BG/dp/B0DDWHLNQK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">514X</a> and 515XR, which fall on the complete opposite end of the chart. The 207 is in a different class in many ways, but Lian Li has priced it so aggressively that we have to make the comparison; it undercuts the 514X and is only $12 over the 515XR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhksIffDaK\">Fractal’s Pop Air</a> is another price-competitive case, but lands at the bottom of this chart. It’s still a good case, and when it’s one sale, it is impressively cheap, but the 207 is thermally superior.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Full Load Thermals - Noise-Normalized</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%2027dBA%20Noise%20Normalized%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4732\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b1f17c32-5b32-4c9b-a5fd-ddd899ba360a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s the CPU noise-normalized chart: Instantly, the Lancool 207 is tied for chart leader in CPU thermals. The average all-core CPU temperature was 41 degrees Celsius above ambient and 44 degrees on just the P-cores. The 216's numbers round differently, but its results were near-identical to the 207's and within error. The 216 was one of our all-time best performers for noise-normalized CPU cooling when we originally reviewed it, so that's good news for the 207. The 207 technically tops our updated chart within error of the 216, but the Antec Flux Pro is also within a one-degree margin. The Flux Pro is at least $180, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison to the more closely price-matched 514X at 48 degrees all-core and 515XR at 53 degrees all-core, the 207 has a massive lead. So far, the 207 looks like another Lancool with an unbeatable price-to-performance ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Full Load Thermals - Full Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20Stock%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4733\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"34826378-c037-4d93-a821-d6fba7c4c76e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>At full speed, the 207 sounds like a server rack. The 41.6dBA result ties the 216. The 216 is the best performer when allowed to brute force its performance by fan speed, roughly tying the 207 when we remove its front panel to test restrictions. With the panel, the 207 ran at 41.6 degrees for P-cores, or about 2 degrees warmer than without a front panel. As far as restrictions go, that’s pretty good: The panel is not substantially hurting performance, unlike some other cases we’ve tested. If you buy the optional filter, that would change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using two layers of gaffer tape over the small mesh section on the steel panel would affect GPU thermals if anything, so it's no surprise that it had no effect on CPU thermals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 207 at 41.6 degrees ties the Flux Pro for performance. Again, though, the noise normalized results are better for case-to-case comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Full Load Thermals - Full Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20Stock%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4734\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2f433477-70dd-45ff-9bab-6f50ffdb6cec\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Now for GPU temperatures at full speed. In the same test, the GPU was 38 degrees above ambient. Taping the side panel vent did nothing. We think this is simply because the bottom intake fans have plenty of other ventilation available through the mesh on the opposite side of the shroud and the wide-open unfiltered vent at the rear of the case. If these inlets had been minimized, it might have mattered more. It still doesn’t hurt to have more mesh in these areas, especially if you shove drives down there, but it just didn’t matter for our GPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPU thermals effectively tied the Flux Pro, but with some back-and-forth over the memory and hotspot temperatures. No matter what, though, the 207 sits alongside the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-Tempered-High-Airflow-Computer/dp/B09XQS5GJN?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Torrent</a> and Flux Pro at the top of this chart. The 216 fell behind here with an average GPU temperature of 43 degrees above ambient, which is still excellent, but not as good as the brute-force bottom intake of the 207.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Full Load Thermals - Standardized Fans</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20Standardized%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4735\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c1ec41f9-9f1c-4e51-9fda-d3d6e21502f2\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Our standardized fan tests use three Noctua fans, always the same ones: two 140mm front intake, and one 120mm rear exhaust, all at 100% speed. We regularly explain the limitations of this testing. You can learn more in our methodology piece <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/guides/3477-case-fan-standardization-tests-noise-normalized-thermals\">here</a>. This allows us to remove stock fans as a variable and compare just the enclosures. With cases like the 207, the comparison is theoretical (since it doesn't make any sense to replace the stock fans), but people request it, so we wanted to provide the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our standard fan configuration was obviously worse for GPU thermals than the stock configuration. With the standard fans, average GPU temperature was 43 degrees above ambient, 48 degrees for the memory, and 56 degrees for hotspot. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Full Load Thermals - Standardized Fans</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20Standardized%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4736\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d8219856-c75e-437b-a712-576527e70350\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>On the CPU with standardized fans, we measured CPU temperatures at 38 degrees above ambient all-core and 42 degrees for the P-cores, within error of the top-scoring Torrent. Mesh fronted cases with straightforward front-to-back airflow patterns do well in this test, and the 207's CPU thermals are particularly good because the front fan slots are biased high, sending more air above the level of the GPU backplate. We usually try to position the intake fans for a better balance with GPU thermals, but that's not an option in the 207.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>VRM & RAM Full Load Thermals - Noise-Normalized</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28VRM_DRAM%20Thermals%29%20_%2027dBA%20Noise%20Normalized%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4737\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9a321a19-7982-4688-8627-0dbba245c561\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The VRM and system memory are located close to the CPU in our test system, so it makes sense that a case with good CPU thermals would have good thermals in those two categories as well. The 207 slightly outperformed the Flux Pro for lowest memory temperature at 21 degrees above ambient, tied with the Torrent. VRM was tied with the Flux Pro at 27 degrees, but that's tied at the top of the chart. The 216 was warmer for both sensors, 23 degrees for the system memory and 28 for VRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lancool-207-conclusion\"><strong>Lian Li Lancool 207 Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

If you buy this case, we recommend choosing a 150mm deep PSU rather than 160 and opting for slimmer cables. Depending on your PSU and the cables you use, there's a serious risk that the side panel won't fit and you'll get annoyed enough to send the case back. Flat, slim cables have a better chance of working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is its only major issue that we encountered. Build quality of the panels is overall excellent, especially at the price, and thermal performance is among the best. The 207 gets a strong, but caveated recommendation, with the caveat again being related to cable management (especially for less experienced builders). If you plan ahead and have patience to thoroughly route cables, and if you can stick to a shorter PSU, we think this case is one of the most competitive on the market for its price. There aren’t a lot of well-built options in this price class.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n      "

The case shoves the power supply to the front to accommodate 2 shroud-top fans that are closer to the floor of the case, providing intake directly into the GPU. The front of the case has a shaped front inlet for 2x 140mm fans cooling the rest, and the back is entirely ventilation to allow exhaust. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a usability perspective, it struggles in some key and basic areas: Cable management is challenging. Closing the right side panel isn’t always easy, especially if you have more cables, thicker gauge wire and sleeving, or accessories that add a ton of cabling. The side panel is tool-less and the back compartment is shallow, with the PSU’s orientation complicating power supply length and cable bends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Editor's note: This was originally published on October 4, 2024 as a video.

None of these changes are meaningful from a consumer perspective. The removable plate never had an assigned function other than to possibly be “DLC” add-ons, the bottom intake fans look basically the same, and the functional area of the side vent hasn't changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lancool-207-specs\"><strong>Lian Li Lancool 207 Specs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Dimensions (DxWxH)</td><td>455.6mm x 219mm x 456mm</td></tr><tr><td>Color</td><td>Black / White</td></tr><tr><td>Motherboard Support</td><td>ATX (Width = 240mm) / Micro-ATX / Mini-ITX</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion Slot</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>2 x 3.5” HDD or 2.5″ SSD</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Length Clearance</td><td>410 mm</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Cooler Height Clearance</td><td>167 mm</td></tr><tr><td>PSU Support</td><td>ATX (Under 160mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Radiator Support</td><td>Top: 240mm / 280mm/ 360mm</td></tr><tr><td>Fan Support</td><td>Front: 140mm x 2 (pre-installed)Top: 120mm x 3 or 140mm x 2Bottom: 120mm x 2 (pre-installed)Rear: 120mm x 1</td></tr><tr><td>Dust Filter</td><td>Bottom x 1</td></tr><tr><td>I/O Ports</td><td>USB 3.0 x 2USB 3.1 Type C x 1Audio x 1Power Button x 1</td></tr><tr><td>MSRP</td><td>Black - US$79.99White - US$84.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><em>Specs copied from manufacturer materials, please read review for our own measurements and opinions</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We like the Lancool 207, and we have a lot of good things to say about it, but we consider the power supply situation to be plagued with oversights.

Rather than elevating the floor and pulling through that, Lian Li pulls through the rear and sides. This allows the floor to be available for hard drives and SSDs. Even with a 3.5” drive installed, there’s still plenty of room between it and the sunken fans to pull air through.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-14h06m57s523.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4701\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b4816b54-6f77-46be-8dc7-6b8270f5c416\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The panels are also exceptionally sturdy for a case of its price.

We'll begrudgingly accept this as a compromise since it cuts the number of fan cables in half. The downside is that it's impractical to replace or reconfigure individual fans, contributing to a larger downside of having to go through Lian Li for replacements if one breaks. The front and bottom mounts aren't compatible with any sizes other than the ones that are preinstalled (140mm front, 120mm bottom). On top of that, the front mount is built around Lian Li's 30mm-thick fans, and all four stock fans are attached with radiator screws. If you still want to replace any, Lian Li includes 16 additional screws sized for 25mm-thick fans. All of this is non-standard and will be unfamiliar to experienced builders. It’s workable, but it will impose atypical limitations on fan compatibility if you want to change them. For instance, you’d typically have 120mm options where 140mm fans install. Here, that’s not the case. The upside is that there’s one less set of rails obstructing intake at the cost of flexibility, so Lian Li is going for the focused airflow approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h43m46s905.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4718\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c2cdc149-001d-4ec8-86ec-00179717793c\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Lian Li describes the 207 as a \"compact M-ATX-sized case with ATX compatibility,\" which is only true by Lian Li standards.

This means that there's a 160mm size limit for PSUs, but even our normal 150mm unit was cramped. Without dropping out of the ATX spec, 150mm is about the smallest you’ll typically get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the rotation, cables are pointed at the tool-less side panel and have to bend sharply to route. Using flat cables helps, but this is a situation where you’ll need to consider how the cables in your power supply are sleeved. We’d also strongly recommend sticking to 150mm rather than using the maximum 160mm under the spec. We’d also strongly recommend modular power supplies for this case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PSU shroud is effectively a fan mount, and even if you could find a way to stick extra cables under it, it'd interfere with the intake fans and the entire point of the design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this would only be an inconvenience, except that the steel side panel is tooless. If you're using bulkier cables with individually braided sleeves like in our example, it is possible to choose power supply and cable combinations that make it nearly impossible to snugly close the side panel. It’s possible, and we did it with our bulky sleeved cables to prove that, but this took a good amount of time to manage and flatten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d strongly recommend flat cables like the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pARWmgnfcVU?t=248\">ones shown in the 207 at Computex</a>. The more accessories and PCIe power cables you run, the more difficulty you’ll have managing the cables in this particular case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screws for the side panel would have helped this by allowing more tolerance for cable bulge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manual illustrates installing a Lian Li <a href=\"https://lian-li.com/product/edge/\">EDGE PSU</a>, which looks like it could help; however, the 207 is $80, and the cheapest EDGE PSUs cost at least $130 to $140. It’s a mismatch of the most likely buyer for the case if Lian Li expects most to use these power supplies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The illustration also shows the EDGE PSU being installed fan-side-up, which isn't an officially supported option for other power supplies. The usual arrangement of mounting holes requires installing standard ATX PSUs fan-down in the 207, with only 1cm of clearance above the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another major concern, in Lian Li’s quest to move the power supply, it has overlooked both cabling and cooling considerations. With the bottom filter installed, which we’ll come back to, the power supply is given mere millimeters to breathe with a bottom-oriented fan. We don’t currently run power supply thermals during our testing; however, this will cause the power supply to heat up, objectively, and it may result in the PSU fan running at a higher RPM (if it is a power supply that bases fan speed on any internal temperatures).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing the filter functionally doubles its breathing room, but ultimately, we think this is a major design shortcoming. Lian Li’s pursuit of minimizing the case size has limited its area for power supply intake. This is making us consider running a thermocouple wire to our power supply for future case reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m40s245.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4724\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m40s245.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m40s245.png\" class=\"wp-image-4724\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"63fb8062-f0fc-4351-800c-97835fd12458\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m42s638.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4725\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m42s638.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h44m42s638.png\" class=\"wp-image-4725\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"50b7391f-954d-4d82-95dc-9a085f611a1d\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The PSU filter is another small design fault: It’s easiest to lift the case to remove the filter, which isn’t a dealbreaker, but could be fixed with a more accessible tab. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m11s347.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4726\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m11s347.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m11s347.png\" class=\"wp-image-4726\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"bb7e4afb-5083-4511-a11a-286e22eee617\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m15s894.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4727\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m15s894.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h45m15s894.png\" class=\"wp-image-4727\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f5cac224-2462-4af4-b234-724c62c640a3\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>On the cable management side on the back of the case, the attachment points for the built-in velcro straps are angled so that the straps curl over as they're inserted, which is a much bigger quality of life improvement than it sounds like.

We also retested the older <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhkgMVm0B1\">Lancool 216</a>, which is still available for around $100. In terms of fan layout, the 207 is most similar to the more expensive Antec Flux Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We only ran basic tests in \"standard mode\" on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LANCOOL-Computer-All-Around-Pre-Installed-Innovative/dp/B0BN3SY5XW?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">216</a>. There's also an \"air cooling mode,\" but in our original review, we found that this helped GPU thermals while simultaneously hurting CPU thermals with our bench hardware. Check <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_w0NbB84P0\">our Lancool 216 review</a> for more detail on alternate configurations, including an external fan bracket attached to the back of the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Full Load Thermals - Noise-Normalized</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%2027dBA%20Noise%20Normalized%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4731\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"517b7d6c-4aa6-47f6-9d39-9c8c5c4c3af1\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The 207 is a loud case with all fans at full speed, but we'll start with noise normalized results. For this testing, all case fans are lowered to reach a target noise level of 27 dBA measured at 1 meter in our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUqYTenB2A0\">hemi-anechoic chamber</a>, with CPU and GPU fan speeds controlled and constant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll start with noise-normalized GPU thermals since those bottom fans should help there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GPU temperature averaged 42 degrees above ambient, 47 on the memory, and 55 hotspot. That's one degree better than the 216 in each category, but still close. Impressively, the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhkjYsuB5b\">Fractal Torrent</a> remains the leader in this particular test. That’s not always true, but it is here. It has its own bottom intake fans that feed the GPU directly, which help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven't always seen a benefit from shroud-top intake fans, but cases like the 207 and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-High-Airflow-Motherboard-Simultaneously-Mid-Tower/dp/B0D9LLWBCB?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Flux Pro</a> that commit to building the case around that concept do show good results. If anything, it's a testament to the 216's cooling that it comes so close to the 207 without any shroud fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhkqyWAwH8\">Antec Flux Pro</a>'s average GPU temperature was about one degree cooler than the 207's.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There's no contest versus the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-All-Metal-Radiator-SST-FA514X-BG/dp/B0DDWHLNQK?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">514X</a> and 515XR, which fall on the complete opposite end of the chart. The 207 is in a different class in many ways, but Lian Li has priced it so aggressively that we have to make the comparison; it undercuts the 514X and is only $12 over the 515XR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhksIffDaK\">Fractal’s Pop Air</a> is another price-competitive case, but lands at the bottom of this chart. It’s still a good case, and when it’s one sale, it is impressively cheap, but the 207 is thermally superior.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Full Load Thermals - Noise-Normalized</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%2027dBA%20Noise%20Normalized%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4732\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b1f17c32-5b32-4c9b-a5fd-ddd899ba360a\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Here’s the CPU noise-normalized chart: Instantly, the Lancool 207 is tied for chart leader in CPU thermals. The average all-core CPU temperature was 41 degrees Celsius above ambient and 44 degrees on just the P-cores. The 216's numbers round differently, but its results were near-identical to the 207's and within error. The 216 was one of our all-time best performers for noise-normalized CPU cooling when we originally reviewed it, so that's good news for the 207. The 207 technically tops our updated chart within error of the 216, but the Antec Flux Pro is also within a one-degree margin. The Flux Pro is at least $180, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison to the more closely price-matched 514X at 48 degrees all-core and 515XR at 53 degrees all-core, the 207 has a massive lead. So far, the 207 looks like another Lancool with an unbeatable price-to-performance ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Full Load Thermals - Full Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20Stock%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4733\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"34826378-c037-4d93-a821-d6fba7c4c76e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>At full speed, the 207 sounds like a server rack. The 41.6dBA result ties the 216. The 216 is the best performer when allowed to brute force its performance by fan speed, roughly tying the 207 when we remove its front panel to test restrictions. With the panel, the 207 ran at 41.6 degrees for P-cores, or about 2 degrees warmer than without a front panel. As far as restrictions go, that’s pretty good: The panel is not substantially hurting performance, unlike some other cases we’ve tested. If you buy the optional filter, that would change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using two layers of gaffer tape over the small mesh section on the steel panel would affect GPU thermals if anything, so it's no surprise that it had no effect on CPU thermals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 207 at 41.6 degrees ties the Flux Pro for performance. Again, though, the noise normalized results are better for case-to-case comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Full Load Thermals - Full Speed</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20100_%20Speed%20Stock%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_0.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4734\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2f433477-70dd-45ff-9bab-6f50ffdb6cec\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Now for GPU temperatures at full speed. In the same test, the GPU was 38 degrees above ambient. Taping the side panel vent did nothing. We think this is simply because the bottom intake fans have plenty of other ventilation available through the mesh on the opposite side of the shroud and the wide-open unfiltered vent at the rear of the case. If these inlets had been minimized, it might have mattered more. It still doesn’t hurt to have more mesh in these areas, especially if you shove drives down there, but it just didn’t matter for our GPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPU thermals effectively tied the Flux Pro, but with some back-and-forth over the memory and hotspot temperatures. No matter what, though, the 207 sits alongside the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-Tempered-High-Airflow-Computer/dp/B09XQS5GJN?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Torrent</a> and Flux Pro at the top of this chart. The 216 fell behind here with an average GPU temperature of 43 degrees above ambient, which is still excellent, but not as good as the brute-force bottom intake of the 207.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>GPU Full Load Thermals - Standardized Fans</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28GPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20Standardized%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_3.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4735\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c1ec41f9-9f1c-4e51-9fda-d3d6e21502f2\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>Our standardized fan tests use three Noctua fans, always the same ones: two 140mm front intake, and one 120mm rear exhaust, all at 100% speed. We regularly explain the limitations of this testing. You can learn more in our methodology piece <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/guides/3477-case-fan-standardization-tests-noise-normalized-thermals\">here</a>. This allows us to remove stock fans as a variable and compare just the enclosures. With cases like the 207, the comparison is theoretical (since it doesn't make any sense to replace the stock fans), but people request it, so we wanted to provide the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our standard fan configuration was obviously worse for GPU thermals than the stock configuration. With the standard fans, average GPU temperature was 43 degrees above ambient, 48 degrees for the memory, and 56 degrees for hotspot. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CPU Full Load Thermals - Standardized Fans</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28CPU%20Thermals%29%20_%20Standardized%20Fans%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_1.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4736\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"d8219856-c75e-437b-a712-576527e70350\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>On the CPU with standardized fans, we measured CPU temperatures at 38 degrees above ambient all-core and 42 degrees for the P-cores, within error of the top-scoring Torrent. Mesh fronted cases with straightforward front-to-back airflow patterns do well in this test, and the 207's CPU thermals are particularly good because the front fan slots are biased high, sending more air above the level of the GPU backplate. We usually try to position the intake fans for a better balance with GPU thermals, but that's not an option in the 207.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>VRM & RAM Full Load Thermals - Noise-Normalized</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20Case%20Benchmark%20_%20Full%20Torture%20%28VRM_DRAM%20Thermals%29%20_%2027dBA%20Noise%20Normalized%20_%202024%20Methodology%20_%20GamersNexus_2.png.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4737\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9a321a19-7982-4688-8627-0dbba245c561\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>The VRM and system memory are located close to the CPU in our test system, so it makes sense that a case with good CPU thermals would have good thermals in those two categories as well. The 207 slightly outperformed the Flux Pro for lowest memory temperature at 21 degrees above ambient, tied with the Torrent. VRM was tied with the Flux Pro at 27 degrees, but that's tied at the top of the chart. The 216 was warmer for both sensors, 23 degrees for the system memory and 28 for VRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"lancool-207-conclusion\"><strong>Lian Li Lancool 207 Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content8113b497-411d-4559-a7fd-dbcf2edc97ca\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-patreon-1000x250%20copy_0.png.webp?itok=4RZbJENx\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-705\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7e3b3c0a-f886-4a4a-a0dc-91df48b99f28\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">Patreon page</a> to contribute a few dollars toward this website's operation (or consider a <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5ae157c6aa4a9989a33c9518\">direct donation</a> or buying something from our <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">GN Store</a>!)

The cases that perform equivalently are more expensive, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antec-High-Airflow-Motherboard-Simultaneously-Mid-Tower/dp/B0D9LLWBCB?tag=gamersnexus01-20\">Flux Pro</a>, and the cases that are in the same general price category perform worse, like the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnhkeKrl0OX\">514X</a>.

The 207 holds the new crown for the best performance for the price -- nothing else that we’ve tested anytime recently is even close when you factor in the price. Lian Li’s 216 is the closest competitor, but is frequently around $100, making it $20 more expensive than the 207.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h46m28s455.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4738\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h46m28s455.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h46m28s455.png\" class=\"wp-image-4738\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"86eea1a5-fc62-453e-a274-af6585897930\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h46m38s390.png.webp\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"4739\" data-full-url=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h46m38s390.png\" data-link=\"/u/inline-images/vlcsnap-2024-10-21-13h46m38s390.png\" class=\"wp-image-4739\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"9b8b7ee7-71b2-4085-8571-2dfdfa73011f\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure></li></ul></figure><p>The biggest problem with the 207 is the cable management and power supply fit: The problem with getting the side panel on over the PSU is potentially a huge obstacle for some cable-heavy or thicker cable configurations and is not shared by any of the other cases we've mentioned. If you buy this case, we recommend choosing a 150mm deep PSU rather than 160 and opting for slimmer cables. Depending on your PSU and the cables you use, there's a serious risk that the side panel won't fit and you'll get annoyed enough to send the case back. Flat, slim cables have a better chance of working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is its only major issue that we encountered. Build quality of the panels is overall excellent, especially at the price, and thermal performance is among the best. The 207 gets a strong, but caveated recommendation, with the caveat again being related to cable management (especially for less experienced builders). If you plan ahead and have patience to thoroughly route cables, and if you can stick to a shorter PSU, we think this case is one of the most competitive on the market for its price. There aren’t a lot of well-built options in this price class.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide sep\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12 col-xl-12\">\n<div class=\"alignwide container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"col align-self-start\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

All Mega Charts are listed on the Features page, including these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/megacharts/cpu-power\">CPU Power Consumption & Efficiency Mega Charts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/megacharts/cpu-coolers\">CPU Cooler Mega Charts</a></li></ul><p>This section contains disclaimers, limitations of the process, and disclosures relating to data quality control. We think that this is all important for your understanding of how this page works and so that you can adjust your own expectations and potential reliance on the data to calibrate with the two groups (“Active” and “LTS”); however, if you’d like to just jump straight to the charts and ignore all of that, you may bypass the wall of text and auto-scroll down <a href=\"#Long-Term-Support-CPU-Charts\" data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#Long-Term-Support-CPU-Charts\">with this link</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article contains our ‘Mega Charts’ for CPU performance benchmarks, including our production tests (commonly referred to as “creation” benchmarks) and gaming tests. Our power testing can be found on the above-linked page and is isolated, as it tends to be more static.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This page will be regularly updated with the latest of our CPU benchmark performance numbers. It will consist of two types of charts: Long-Term Support (“LTS”) and Active. The long-term support charts have several special caveats, but are intended to be available to help people better determine upgrade paths. The LTS charts are more likely to contain older CPU results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page also includes links to CPU reviews and comparisons, such as historical AMD vs. Intel benchmarks. It will be updated on a slower cadence from our latest reviews (so you should always defer to those for the most recent numbers), but will be updated a few times a year with larger charts than are found in our reviews. This is for a few reasons, but one is that we shorten review charts due to video height limitations (16:9 aspect ratio). The other is that it’s just too crowded for the regular updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This page is intended to be used long-term for our Mega Charts. You can bookmark this page, as our future updates for CPU Mega Charts will land at this same URL. The update log will be posted at the bottom of the page so that you always know the latest data set.

We are constantly re-running our CPU tests to keep data fresh, but unfortunately, this refresh cycle means that it is difficult to stack more CPUs on the charts before some sort of major change comes in. For example, major Windows updates necessitate full re-tests for reviews, but may not be as important for someone who just wants to see their older CPU represented for a “good enough” gauge of where things fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why we split these into the LTS (Long-Term Support) and Active charts. It allows us to maintain one older dataset that has more CPUs represented, at the cost of reduced insights gained from our most modern test methods. Active gives you that for more of a modern head-to-head. It’s the difference between precision (Active) and quantity of CPUs (LTS). This is the best balance that a small team can produce, especially since we provide this website completely ad-free (you can support us <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">on Patreon</a> or by buying something useful for your PC builds on <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">our store</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Current Best CPUs (Generalized Recommendations)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The below is a simple list of CPUs that, at the time of writing (dated in the columns below), we think make sense <strong>or </strong>would make sense with caveats noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay careful attention to the second column. We may only recommend some parts under certain pricing conditions. <strong>Generally speaking, we do not recommend buying CPUs above MSRP. </strong>They come down pretty regularly, especially with launch cycles. For instance, when we first posted this, the 7800X3D was about $250 overpriced. It's still on the list so that people are aware of it, but we advise waiting for it to approach that MSRP marker or to be replaced with the pending 9000X3D parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a <strong>better and more thorough list of Best CPUs</strong>, please check our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/best-cpus-2023-intel-vs-amd-gaming-video-editing-budget-biggest-disappointment\">Best CPUs of 2023 article</a>.

Here’s What to Do</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We frequently receive questions from people asking where their particular CPU would land on a chart. There are thousands of CPUs that could be tested, so we obviously don’t have all of those listed. The best bet is to approximate the positioning by just thinking through the data that is present and using deductive reasoning. Newer builders may not realize that it is often this simple, so we’ll outline some concepts so that you can at least get a rough idea of where your part might fall. You can apply this to any reviewer’s charts. And of course, if we’re missing a part, there are plenty of qualified reviewers out there who may have something we’re missing (and we likewise try to cover what they miss) -- that’s the value of multiple qualified reviewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>CPU Performance Interpolation/Deductive Reasoning Examples</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 1: The Ryzen 5 1600AF is not present on the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: The Ryzen 5 1600AF is functionally an R5 2600, just at slightly different clocks. Looking up original reviews would get you this information, which you can then apply to modern charts. Looking at the R5 2600 in a chart is close enough to the R5 1600AF that you could base your decisions off of that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 2: The Ryzen 5 2600 is also missing from the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: Pull up a few old/original reviews of the R5 2600 and identify parts that are nearby or adjacent in performance. Look at a few charts, as some games can differ. Once you have found the most commonly comparable part, you can use that as a rough gauge on charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 3: The i7-10700K is missing from the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: If the i5-10600K and i9-10900K are present, it’s reasonable to assume that the 10700K is between them. Although this can have a relatively wide range, the reality is that, especially upgrading from something older, it won’t matter enough to hurt decision making on new processor purchases (since anything will be a huge upgrade).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 4: The Sandy Bridge i7-2600K is present, but not the i7-2700K</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: In situations such as these, where the part is basically just a slight change (example: 2700X vs. 2700, 2600X vs. 2600, 7700X vs 7700), you can just look at the one that is present and assume close enough performance to compare. This is again where it’s important to keep perspective: If the goal is to upgrade, being 2-5% off on the estimate isn’t going to meaningfully impact decisions if the alternative is no good modern data as reviewers move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a last-ditch solution: You can look at games or benchmarks which are least likely suspected to have had major patches, such as GTA V, and calculate the percent difference between the target part and mutually present part on both an older chart and the new one. Then apply this to the modern chart to approximate or interpolate the rank. For example, if you pull up a chart from two years ago with the 8700K and 12700K on it and calculate the difference (typically, (new - old) / old), you can then apply that on the same game chart from modern times. <strong>This is the least perfect method </strong>because newer games may have architecturally evolved and may not be linear and older games get patches. You’d frankly be better off finding it somewhere else on the internet, but if you really can’t, this is a method that helps get at least something to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"disclaimer\"><strong>DISCLAIMER: Data Accuracy Standards & Reduced Vetting Practices</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For standalone reviews that receive full video treatment, we run through a quality control process that is intensive and often takes several days to complete. These are time-intensive, cost-intensive, and critical to the accuracy of our mainline reviews. We would never skip steps for the fully produced reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we want to publish more of the data we collect outside of the reviews process because it’d help people with purchasing decisions. We have been resistant to publishing the extra data because the ‘extra’ data doesn’t go through the same validation processes. It’s still useful and rarely has issues; however, our QC standards are high and we are careful with what we release. Anything we’re uncertain of or haven’t vetted fully is withheld until it clears those bars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a lot of people would benefit from knowing where an AMD R7 1700 lands today, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw67eaT32U\">outside of full revisits</a>, we don’t have a good avenue to release data that is useful, likely up to our usual standards, but just not quadruple-checked. That’s what the Long-Term Support (LTS) charts are for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve decided to release the extra data to try and cast a wide net to help people upgrading from older or more obscure parts, but are doing so with the upfront disclosure that the difference between the Active charts and the LTS charts is the validation process. In other words, data which exists on LTS charts but not Active charts should be understood by the audience as more likely to have some sort of data confidence issue or possible deviation from expected results. It is still <strong>unlikely</strong>, but <strong>more likely than Active </strong>charts. With that transparency and understanding, here’s the difference in our processes:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Active-Chart-Vetting-Process\"><strong>Active Chart Vetting Process</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our biggest hangups for publishing a full list of our “Mega Charts” for CPUs has been that we simply cannot sustain the intensive QC process for a secondary dataset that contains CPUs that haven’t been published on the channel recently. We often still collect data for older CPUs, but may not publish it for time reasons (meaning that it was collected for internal review, but not fully vetted for publication). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the full process, with some specialty confidential steps removed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Test Lead for the tests (typically Steve) establishes a strict SOP for the test suite to ensure data consistency. The Test Lead also determines which software is tested, performs benchmark analysis for standard deviation and consistency, and determines the testing methodology</li><li>The Test Lead (typically Steve) establishes a Test Matrix containing all CPUs to be tested, which tests they get, and data exporting practices</li><li>The Subject Matter Expert (Patrick) builds software in collaboration with Steve for the test suite and builds the operating system configurations, establishing a “pre-flight checklist” for testing</li><li>The Technician who runs the tests (primarily Mike, with assistance from Patrick and Steve and occasionally Jeremy) will check the results for correct resolution, correct settings, captures that prove the test completed correctly, image quality, and general errors. The technician performs re-runs as needed</li><li>The Subject Matter Expert performs a secondary quality control pass on data. Any data which looks suspect of a bad pass, which requires manual filtering & removal prior to retests, will be deleted and flagged for the technician to rerun</li><li>The Technician performs re-tests and then re-evaluates the results</li><li>The Subject Matter Expert reviews them again. They are typically resolved at this stage and occasionally rejected entirely to move forward</li><li>A Writer & Technician (typically Jeremy) performs a full pass on CPU export names, the hierarchical stack of the data and whether the hierarchy makes sense, and identifies potential areas where additional data may be necessary to confidently come to conclusions, then passes it to Steve. If Steve authorizes any of the re-evaluations from the Writer & Technician, they go back to the lab again for testing.</li><li>Steve performs final intensive review, including running a variety of formulae for data consistency and evaluating results against archival results for consistency of scaling</li><li>The Writer & Technician double-checks the finals. Any disagreement with what Steve passed is voiced and revisited. Once both are in agreement that it makes sense (or the suspect data is removed until validated), the data is sent to publication</li><li>The video editor, who is often technical enough to identify obvious oversights, performs a ‘passive’ QC while editing and flags any issues. If any are found, they go through Steve for review, analysis, and either sign-off as accurate or correction</li></ul><p>You’ll notice that a big part of the process is passing the results through multiple team members -- typically 4-5 people look at it before publishing. This is <strong>slow</strong>, but important. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Long-Term-Support-Chart-Vetting-Process\"><strong>Long-Term Support Chart Vetting Process</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Long-Term Support charts will contain data which is not in reviews, but was used as internal gauges for where parts should sensically land. As a result, this is the process it has followed since it has not previously been published:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>(Same) The Team Lead for the tests (typically Steve) establishes a strict SOP for the test suite to ensure data consistency.

Data with low confidence is removed rather than investigated. Not every single data point is inspected, unlike reviews</li></ul><p>This allows the team to continue work on important next reviews without forcing us to skip more important upcoming projects, but still allows us to get helpful data out. You’ll notice that this approach cuts at least 2 potential internal reviewers from the process, including reducing the amount of times the SME looks over the data, and reduces the review of every single data point down to ad-hoc glances to see if anything “jumps out” as obviously bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see anything that looks out of order, you are welcome to email us at team at gamersnexus dot net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are hopeful that this will allow us to publish more data to help people make upgrade decisions, with a middle-ground understanding going into it as to the limitations of the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the helpful information on how to use these charts and the disclosures out of the way, let’s continue to the data set.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Long-Term-Support-CPU-Charts\"><strong>Long-Term Support CPU Charts (1H24)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LTS DATA SET: </strong>Zen 5 Review Cycle (pre-Arrow Lake)</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-contentf7d0d9dd-e4cd-40bf-93af-cfbd8397cd4a\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/gn-modmat-1000x489_1.jpg.webp?itok=s9kfQVoH\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-461\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"62585ecd-9086-4c84-a43e-b3bf675230d4\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Grab a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\">GN15 Large Anti-Static Modmat</a> to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and for a high-quality PC building work surface.

If your workloads resemble this, you may be able to assume some level of linearity.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"block block-block-content block-block-content35531c56-5d61-4fbc-8ab9-0148f4350812\">\n\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n\n           <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_responsive_no_watermark_\"><a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-debug-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-100x100mm-4x4\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/coaster-debug.jpg.webp?itok=VOLOf62b\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-725\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"b4f5b6ce-0532-4a34-963b-064a24c97ebb\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></a><figcaption>Buy a GN 4-Pack of <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-debug-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-100x100mm-4x4\">PC-themed 3D Coasters</a>!

Our intent with this approach is that you can determine the best-value upgrade (our reviews are very value-oriented) by comparing the typical or average gap between two parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most scenarios, the CPUs will scale similarly from game-to-game, barring any unique behaviors of a particular game. If CPU A is better value in Game A, B, and C, it is very likely also better value in Game D (though not always). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For individual per-game benchmarks, we’d recommend our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cat/game-benchmarks-graphics-guides\">Game Benchmarks section</a> that deep-dives on new releases whenever we get a chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2 CPU Benchmarks</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large_megachart_special\"><img src=\"http://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_megachart_special/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Dragon%27s%20Dogma%202%20_%201080p_High%20_%20GamersNexus%20%28SUPPORT_donate_%20store.gamersnexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4647\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"eb336e8c-5502-4038-b779-21ce12c4199e\" data-image-style=\"original\" /></figure><p>This is for Dragon’s Dogma 2, which is one of the newest games in our CPU test suite.

All Mega Charts are listed on the Features page, including these:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/megacharts/cpu-power\">CPU Power Consumption & Efficiency Mega Charts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/megacharts/cpu-coolers\">CPU Cooler Mega Charts</a></li></ul><p>This section contains disclaimers, limitations of the process, and disclosures relating to data quality control. We think that this is all important for your understanding of how this page works and so that you can adjust your own expectations and potential reliance on the data to calibrate with the two groups (“Active” and “LTS”); however, if you’d like to just jump straight to the charts and ignore all of that, you may bypass the wall of text and auto-scroll down <a href=\"#Long-Term-Support-CPU-Charts\" data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#Long-Term-Support-CPU-Charts\">with this link</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article contains our ‘Mega Charts’ for CPU performance benchmarks, including our production tests (commonly referred to as “creation” benchmarks) and gaming tests. Our power testing can be found on the above-linked page and is isolated, as it tends to be more static.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This page will be regularly updated with the latest of our CPU benchmark performance numbers. It will consist of two types of charts: Long-Term Support (“LTS”) and Active. The long-term support charts have several special caveats, but are intended to be available to help people better determine upgrade paths. The LTS charts are more likely to contain older CPU results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The page also includes links to CPU reviews and comparisons, such as historical AMD vs. Intel benchmarks. It will be updated on a slower cadence from our latest reviews (so you should always defer to those for the most recent numbers), but will be updated a few times a year with larger charts than are found in our reviews. This is for a few reasons, but one is that we shorten review charts due to video height limitations (16:9 aspect ratio). The other is that it’s just too crowded for the regular updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This page is intended to be used long-term for our Mega Charts. You can bookmark this page, as our future updates for CPU Mega Charts will land at this same URL. The update log will be posted at the bottom of the page so that you always know the latest data set. It will be updated a couple times a year, with more frequency updates in the CPU reviews themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator alignfull is-style-wide\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"align-self-start col-md-2 my-2 credits\">\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Credits</h4>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator alignfull is-style-wide\" /><h5 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Test Lead, Host, Writing</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center h6\">Steve Burke</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Testing</h5>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center h6\">Patrick Lathan<br />Mike Gaglione</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator alignfull is-style-wide\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"alignwide container text-overlay pt-5 px-0\">\n<div class=\"row justify-content-center align-items-center justify-content-evenly\">\n<div class=\"align-self-center col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-10 col-lg-7 my-4\">\n<h3 id=\"How-to-Use-This\"><strong>How to Use This</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as data ages, it is often still relevant for comparison -- particularly for older CPUs which mostly stop receiving performance-affecting changes, such as microcode updates or Windows patches. We are constantly re-running our CPU tests to keep data fresh, but unfortunately, this refresh cycle means that it is difficult to stack more CPUs on the charts before some sort of major change comes in. For example, major Windows updates necessitate full re-tests for reviews, but may not be as important for someone who just wants to see their older CPU represented for a “good enough” gauge of where things fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why we split these into the LTS (Long-Term Support) and Active charts. It allows us to maintain one older dataset that has more CPUs represented, at the cost of reduced insights gained from our most modern test methods. Active gives you that for more of a modern head-to-head. It’s the difference between precision (Active) and quantity of CPUs (LTS). This is the best balance that a small team can produce, especially since we provide this website completely ad-free (you can support us <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/gamersnexus\">on Patreon</a> or by buying something useful for your PC builds on <a href=\"https://store.gamersnexus.net/\">our store</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Current Best CPUs (Generalized Recommendations)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The below is a simple list of CPUs that, at the time of writing (dated in the columns below), we think make sense <strong>or </strong>would make sense with caveats noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay careful attention to the second column. We may only recommend some parts under certain pricing conditions. <strong>Generally speaking, we do not recommend buying CPUs above MSRP. </strong>They come down pretty regularly, especially with launch cycles. For instance, when we first posted this, the 7800X3D was about $250 overpriced. It's still on the list so that people are aware of it, but we advise waiting for it to approach that MSRP marker or to be replaced with the pending 9000X3D parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a <strong>better and more thorough list of Best CPUs</strong>, please check our <a href=\"https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/best-cpus-2023-intel-vs-amd-gaming-video-editing-budget-biggest-disappointment\">Best CPUs of 2023 article</a>.

Here’s What to Do</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We frequently receive questions from people asking where their particular CPU would land on a chart. There are thousands of CPUs that could be tested, so we obviously don’t have all of those listed. The best bet is to approximate the positioning by just thinking through the data that is present and using deductive reasoning. Newer builders may not realize that it is often this simple, so we’ll outline some concepts so that you can at least get a rough idea of where your part might fall. You can apply this to any reviewer’s charts. And of course, if we’re missing a part, there are plenty of qualified reviewers out there who may have something we’re missing (and we likewise try to cover what they miss) -- that’s the value of multiple qualified reviewers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>CPU Performance Interpolation/Deductive Reasoning Examples</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 1: The Ryzen 5 1600AF is not present on the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: The Ryzen 5 1600AF is functionally an R5 2600, just at slightly different clocks. Looking up original reviews would get you this information, which you can then apply to modern charts. Looking at the R5 2600 in a chart is close enough to the R5 1600AF that you could base your decisions off of that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 2: The Ryzen 5 2600 is also missing from the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: Pull up a few old/original reviews of the R5 2600 and identify parts that are nearby or adjacent in performance. Look at a few charts, as some games can differ. Once you have found the most commonly comparable part, you can use that as a rough gauge on charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 3: The i7-10700K is missing from the charts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: If the i5-10600K and i9-10900K are present, it’s reasonable to assume that the 10700K is between them. Although this can have a relatively wide range, the reality is that, especially upgrading from something older, it won’t matter enough to hurt decision making on new processor purchases (since anything will be a huge upgrade).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 4: The Sandy Bridge i7-2600K is present, but not the i7-2700K</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solution: In situations such as these, where the part is basically just a slight change (example: 2700X vs. 2700, 2600X vs. 2600, 7700X vs 7700), you can just look at the one that is present and assume close enough performance to compare. This is again where it’s important to keep perspective: If the goal is to upgrade, being 2-5% off on the estimate isn’t going to meaningfully impact decisions if the alternative is no good modern data as reviewers move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a last-ditch solution: You can look at games or benchmarks which are least likely suspected to have had major patches, such as GTA V, and calculate the percent difference between the target part and mutually present part on both an older chart and the new one. Then apply this to the modern chart to approximate or interpolate the rank. For example, if you pull up a chart from two years ago with the 8700K and 12700K on it and calculate the difference (typically, (new - old) / old), you can then apply that on the same game chart from modern times. <strong>This is the least perfect method </strong>because newer games may have architecturally evolved and may not be linear and older games get patches. You’d frankly be better off finding it somewhere else on the internet, but if you really can’t, this is a method that helps get at least something to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"disclaimer\"><strong>DISCLAIMER: Data Accuracy Standards & Reduced Vetting Practices</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For standalone reviews that receive full video treatment, we run through a quality control process that is intensive and often takes several days to complete. These are time-intensive, cost-intensive, and critical to the accuracy of our mainline reviews. We would never skip steps for the fully produced reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we want to publish more of the data we collect outside of the reviews process because it’d help people with purchasing decisions. We have been resistant to publishing the extra data because the ‘extra’ data doesn’t go through the same validation processes. It’s still useful and rarely has issues; however, our QC standards are high and we are careful with what we release. Anything we’re uncertain of or haven’t vetted fully is withheld until it clears those bars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a lot of people would benefit from knowing where an AMD R7 1700 lands today, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw67eaT32U\">outside of full revisits</a>, we don’t have a good avenue to release data that is useful, likely up to our usual standards, but just not quadruple-checked. That’s what the Long-Term Support (LTS) charts are for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve decided to release the extra data to try and cast a wide net to help people upgrading from older or more obscure parts, but are doing so with the upfront disclosure that the difference between the Active charts and the LTS charts is the validation process. In other words, data which exists on LTS charts but not Active charts should be understood by the audience as more likely to have some sort of data confidence issue or possible deviation from expected results. It is still <strong>unlikely</strong>, but <strong>more likely than Active </strong>charts. With that transparency and understanding, here’s the difference in our processes:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Active-Chart-Vetting-Process\"><strong>Active Chart Vetting Process</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of our biggest hangups for publishing a full list of our “Mega Charts” for CPUs has been that we simply cannot sustain the intensive QC process for a secondary dataset that contains CPUs that haven’t been published on the channel recently. We often still collect data for older CPUs, but may not publish it for time reasons (meaning that it was collected for internal review, but not fully vetted for publication). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the full process, with some specialty confidential steps removed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Test Lead for the tests (typically Steve) establishes a strict SOP for the test suite to ensure data consistency. The Test Lead also determines which software is tested, performs benchmark analysis for standard deviation and consistency, and determines the testing methodology</li><li>The Test Lead (typically Steve) establishes a Test Matrix containing all CPUs to be tested, which tests they get, and data exporting practices</li><li>The Subject Matter Expert (Patrick) builds software in collaboration with Steve for the test suite and builds the operating system configurations, establishing a “pre-flight checklist” for testing</li><li>The Technician who runs the tests (primarily Mike, with assistance from Patrick and Steve and occasionally Jeremy) will check the results for correct resolution, correct settings, captures that prove the test completed correctly, image quality, and general errors. The technician performs re-runs as needed</li><li>The Subject Matter Expert performs a secondary quality control pass on data. Any data which looks suspect of a bad pass, which requires manual filtering & removal prior to retests, will be deleted and flagged for the technician to rerun</li><li>The Technician performs re-tests and then re-evaluates the results</li><li>The Subject Matter Expert reviews them again. They are typically resolved at this stage and occasionally rejected entirely to move forward</li><li>A Writer & Technician (typically Jeremy) performs a full pass on CPU export names, the hierarchical stack of the data and whether the hierarchy makes sense, and identifies potential areas where additional data may be necessary to confidently come to conclusions, then passes it to Steve. If Steve authorizes any of the re-evaluations from the Writer & Technician, they go back to the lab again for testing.</li><li>Steve performs final intensive review, including running a variety of formulae for data consistency and evaluating results against archival results for consistency of scaling</li><li>The Writer & Technician double-checks the finals. Any disagreement with what Steve passed is voiced and revisited. Once both are in agreement that it makes sense (or the suspect data is removed until validated), the data is sent to publication</li><li>The video editor, who is often technical enough to identify obvious oversights, performs a ‘passive’ QC while editing and flags any issues. If any are found, they go through Steve for review, analysis, and either sign-off as accurate or correction</li></ul><p>You’ll notice that a big part of the process is passing the results through multiple team members -- typically 4-5 people look at it before publishing. This is <strong>slow</strong>, but important. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"Long-Term-Support-Chart-Vetting-Process\"><strong>Long-Term Support Chart Vetting Process</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Long-Term Support charts will contain data which is not in reviews, but was used as internal gauges for where parts should sensically land. As a result, this is the process it has followed since it has not previously been published:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>(Same) The Team Lead for the tests (typically Steve) establishes a strict SOP for the test suite to ensure data consistency.
